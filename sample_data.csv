Police and rescue workers were summoned to the condominium on Therd Thai Road in Bangkok on Tuesday morning. There they found two women badly wounded inside a room on the 18th floor.

A man, identified later as Thana Diewduangsil, 56, was found sitting on the edge of the balcony. The Bangkok Post reported.

Ms Rattana Pinkham, 42, (the ex-wife), sustained a deep slash wound to her throat. Rescue workers tried to help her, but she died due to severe blood loss. Her mother, Saowanee Pinkham, 70, had her wrists slashed and was rushed to a nearby hospital. A five-inch knife was found inside the room.

Mr Thana threatened to jump from the balcony and police had tried to calm him down. However he finally jumped and landed behind this high-rise condominium building. He was rushed to a Bangkok hospital and pronounced dead later.

A Bangkok police investigation found that Mr Thana was a former husband of Ms Rattana. Before the incident, the woman called to invite him for drinks at her condo room to celebrate her birthday. They drank until Tuesday morning and later had a heated quarrel allegedly stemming from jealousy.

Mr Thana then reportedly used a knife to slash his ex-wife throat. Her mother, who was inside a room, immediately came to help her daughter, but he slashed her wrists.

Thai media reported that the man sang a song before jumped to his death from the Bangkok condominium.", Kill by physical assault,3
44,243b0d67a8bd945bd994b0d6607c2729,"A former Minister of Aviation, Chief Osita Chidoka, has called on other geopolitical zones in Nigeria to support the South-East’s bid to produce the President of Nigeria in 2023.

He also urged the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party to respect their zoning tradition by zoning the Presidency to the South-East.

He added that such development would prevent political crisis in the country.

Chidoka, according to a statement on Tuesday by his Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Okafor, spoke while reviewing a book authorised by a First Republic minister, Mbazulike Amechi.

The book was titled, ‘A Political History of Modern Nigeria: Words and Thoughts of Mbazulike Amechi.’

The former corps marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps, said, “I crave your indulgence to use the words of the Northern Elders Forum, contained in an advertorial where they warned President Goodluck Jonathan not to contest the 2011 election.

“I also want to use the same word to sound a note of warning that, if the country’s two major political parties do not continue in the tradition of the agreed rotation, they will undermine the peace and tranquility of Nigeria.”

He added that failure to incorporate the South-East in the 2023 calculations would be “ill-conceived, ill-advised, and definitely divisive.”

He stated that the South-East had always been committed to the unity, harmonious co-existence, mutual understanding, economic development, social and political wellbeing of the country.

He added that it was time, some people dropped any unfounded distrust of Ndigbo, and fight to enthrone the politics of live-and-let-live.

He advised the South-East not to rest on its oars and wait for the Igbo Presidency but to constructively engage with the rest of the country to actualise the dream.

45,2de077cba1272d4581f86a1a1cda4d10,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the world would soon 'witness a new strategic weapon'

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared an end to moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon.

Analysts said the announcement, reported by state media on Wednesday, amounted to Kim putting a missile ""to Donald Trump's head"" -- but warned that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Washington was swift to respond, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Kim to ""take a different course"" and stressing that the US wanted ""peace not confrontation"" with the North, while Trump played down the development.

Pyongyang has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests, the last of them 16 times more powerful than the Hiroshima blast, according to the highest estimates.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been a centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and the US president, but little tangible progress.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's ""promise"" to him not to carry them out, and has downplayed launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February. The North set the US an end-of-2019 deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a ""new way"".

""There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,"" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim as telling top ruling party officials.

""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" he added, referring to the North by its official name.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party was an indication of a major policy shift.

State television showed veteran newsreader Ri Chun Hee reading out the KCNA dispatch over footage of Kim addressing the officials and general imagery of the country.

The broadcast appeared to stand in place of Kim's usual New Year speech -- normally a key moment in the North Korean political calendar.

Kim acknowledged the impact of international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programmes, but made clear that the North was willing to pay the price to preserve its nuclear capability.

""The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,"" KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had ""conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop"" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said.

- 'Geopolitical chicken' -

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it take more tangible steps towards giving them up.

""North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump's head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,"" said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

""Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,"" he added.

The strategy was risky, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with ""more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account"".

Kim's moratorium comments were ""ominous"", said Leif-Eric Easley of Ewha University in Seoul, but added that he could be looking to ""elicit concessions by approaching Trump's red line without crossing it"".

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carries out a long-range missile test.

Speaking to Fox News and CBS after Kim's announcement, Pompeo said a resumption of nuclear and missile tests would be ""deeply disappointing"".

""We hope that Chairman Kim will take a different course... that he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,"" Pompeo said.

""We want peace, not confrontation,"" he added, with Seoul's unification ministry adding that a strategic weapon test ""would not help denuclearisation negotiations"".

106,c8011ead21923ba8c5b836a9ae1916c5,"DECATUR, Ala – It’s a part of everyday life that generally goes unnoticed unless something goes wrong. Decatur Utilities has reported more than 6 million gallons of sewer overflows this year. And some residents are concerned.

“It’s not healthy,” said Cesar Soto.

What he’s talking about is this manhole down the street from his house that recently overflowed with sewer water during heavy rains.

In February of this year, more than 1.6 million gallons of wastewater overflowed from that manhole on Sixth Avenue SW. It happened again just last week when there was an overflow of more than 22,000 gallons.

“They come and they place a sign that says hey stay away from it, avoid direct contact with the liquid,” Soto said.

He said he has seen the signs placed by Decatur Utilities warning residents about the overflow. But staying away from it can be hard to do when the affected manhole is smack-dab in the middle of the road.

“Because you got to drive through it and some of the neighbors who have to walk to go to the store have to go through it,” he explained.

According to Decatur Utilities, crews pressure-washed this area after the overflow.

Wastewater can contain disease-causing pathogens, bacteria, and worms according to the EPA. Exposure can result in stomach flu, upper respiratory infections, and even life-threatening illnesses.

“Untreated sewage can cause dysentery, a lot of my friends in Decatur were shocked about that. We think of the Oregon Trail and that’s an 18th-century problem, not a 21st-century problem,” said David Whiteside, executive director of Tennessee Riverkeeper.

The organization sued Decatur Utilities over sewer overflows, which are also referred to as ‘SSO’s. They began tracking the number of SSO’s through the Utilities’ required reporting to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) website.

“Admits that these problems have been persistent and ongoing for years,” Whiteside said.

Decatur Utilities provided a statement to WHNT detailing a 10-year plan to ADEM in 2013 to improve wastewater infrastructure. The utility said it has invested $60 million over the past 10 years to improve its wastewater infrastructure.

But Whiteside said the lawsuit aims to speed up that process.

“We’re reasonable. We know they can’t replace every sewage line in Morgan County to fix the problem so they need to look at the hot spots, the areas that these overflows are occurring most frequently,” Whiteside said.

And the families on Sixth Avenue?

“It’s a problem that should be taken care of,” Soto said.

They said they just want the overflows to stop.

The Attorney General’s Office has joined the lawsuit the Tennessee Riverkeeper filed. According to the AG’s suit, beginning in 2014 Decatur Utilities has had dozens of unpermitted discharges of pollutants. The lawsuit said the Attorney General is empowered to seek a maximum fine of $25,000 per violation.

Wike issued the warning while swearing in, 13 commissioners and 15 special advisers, at the Government House in Port Harcourt on Tuesday.

He told his new aides to resign immediately if they were in his administration to look for money to run for the 2023 governorship position.

He said that the state government got preliminary report that none of the special advisers or commissioners was involved in cultism.

Wike said, “If we find out eventually that any of you is involved in the sponsorship of cult groups, that person will be shown the way out of government.”

11:51 PM

Jewish settlers, today, attacked Palestinian vehicles traveling on roads in the north of the West Bank, with stones, causing injury to people and damage to several cars, according to a Palestinian official.

Ghassan Daghlas, in charge of the Israeli settlements file in the north of the West Bank, told WAFA that settlers from the former settlement of Homesh, which was built illegally on Burqa and Silat al-Daher lands, hurled stones at a number of Palestinian vehicles travelling between Nablus and Jenin.

Daghlas said that 25 vehicles sustained broken windows and several people were injured from shattered glass. They were treated on the location.

The United States is immediately deploying about 750 soldiers to the Middle East in response to the violent protests at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday.

Esper said in a statement he had authorized the deployment of an infantry battalion from the Immediate Response Force (IRF) of the 82nd Airborne Division. Apart from the immediate deployment, additional forces from the IRF are prepared to deploy over the next several days, he said.

""This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,"" Esper's statement said.

U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 750 troops would initially be based out of Kuwait. The officials said that as many as 4,000 troops could be sent to the region in the coming days if needed.

More than 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq supporting local forces.

Unprecedented attack

Protesters angry about U.S. air strikes on Iraq hurled stones and torched a security post at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, setting off a confrontation with guards.

The protests, led by Iranian-backed militias, posed a new foreign policy challenge for U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces re-election in 2020. He threatened to retaliate against Iran.

The State Department said diplomatic personnel inside were safe and there were no plans to evacuate them.

Embassy guards used stun grenades and tear gas to repel protesters, who stormed and burned the security post at the entrance but did not breach the main compound

The unprecedented attack on an American diplomatic mission in Iraq marked a sharp escalation of the proxy conflict between the United States and Iran - both influential players in the country - and plunged U.S. relations with Iraq to their worst level in years.

The United States and its allies invaded Iraq in 2003 and ousted Saddam Hussein. But political stability has been elusive.

Trump, on a two-week working vacation in Palm Beach, Florida, spoke by phone to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq. ""President Trump emphasized the need to protect United States personnel and facilities in Iraq,"" the White House said.

Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the violence.

""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,"" Trump said in a tweet.

Iran, under severe economic duress from punishing U.S. sanctions put in place by Trump, denied responsibility.

""America has the surprising audacity of attributing to Iran the protests of the Iraqi people against (Washington's) savage killing of at least 25 Iraqis,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said.

The embassy incident came seven years after the 2012 attack by armed militants on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the death of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans and led to multiple congressional investigations.

Tensions over air strikes

The protests followed U.S. air strikes on Sunday on bases operated by the Iranian-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah inside Iraq, which killed at least 25 fighters and wounded 55. The strikes were retaliation for the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, which Washington blamed on Kataib Hezbollah.

""Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.""

Democrats upset that Trump ditched the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2015 were quick to pounce on the incident as a failure of Trump's Iran policy.

""The predictable result of the Trump administration's reckless bluster, escalation and miscalculation in the Middle East is that we are now hurtling closer to an unauthorized war with Iran that the American people do not support,"" said U.S. Senator Tom Udall, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

The protesters, joined briefly by Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim militia leaders, threw stones at the embassy gate, while others chanted: ""No, no, America! No, no, Trump!""

Iraqi special forces prevented protesters entering, later reinforced by U.S.-trained Iraqi Counter Terrorism forces.

The embassy has been hit by sporadic but non-lethal rocket fire in recent months, and was regularly shelled following the U.S.-led invasion of 2003, but had not been physically attacked by demonstrators in that way before.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS News that U.S. officials never contemplated evacuating the embassy and had kept the heat on Iraqi officials to ensure the compound was safe.

""We reminded them throughout the day of their continued responsibility,"" he said.

The Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella grouping of the militias that have been officially integrated into Iraq's armed forces, said 62 militiamen and civilians were wounded by the tear gas and stun grenades fired to disperse the crowd.

A Reuters witness saw blood on the face of one wounded militiaman and on the stomach of the other as their colleagues carried them away.

Iraqis have been taking to the streets in the thousands almost daily to condemn, among other things, militias such as Kataib Hezbollah and their Iranian patrons that support Abdul Mahdi's government.

282,ae5cb9e0b9129c57fb307cccdbe04c41,"Rogue financiers are shifting their operations abroad to fleece pensioners of millions of pounds.

An overseas base helps them dodge tighter UK regulations while also still taking advantage of official listings with the Inland Revenue.

Victims who have lost their life savings last night called on the Government to clamp down on the flagrant abuse of HMRC’S system for registering non-UK pension schemes.

Pension scammers are moving their operations abroad to dodge tighter UK regulations while taking advantage of Qualified Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes (Qrops). Continental Wealth Management is facing a £2.5million legal action in the Costa Blanca for using Qrops in alleged scams

They had thought it was safe to switch their nest eggs into the foreign funds because they were recognised by the British authorities.

But the money went into high-risk and often toxic investments that paid huge commissions to the scammers. The revelation follows a Mail investigation this week that has exposed how savers lost up to £10billion between them in UK schemes registered with HMRC and the Pensions Regulator.

This official registration led Army veterans, police officers, firemen, paramedics, care workers and teachers to believe the schemes were above board – until their money vanished.

The Government belatedly tightened regulations on British-based schemes – only for the swindlers to move abroad. This allows them to cold-call potential customers – a sales tactic outlawed in the UK this year because of its use by conmen. It also means rogue financial advisers can levy huge commissions, a practice also banned here.

Many people have lost their retirement savings (file image) as they were duped by scammers who are listed with HMRC and immediately 'lends credibility', according to Susan Monaghan, who was one of the victims

Pensions can be moved abroad only to companies on the official list of Qualified Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes (Qrops). And some of these have been exploited by scammers.

Continental Wealth Management is facing a £2.5million legal action in the Costa Blanca for using Qrops in alleged scams. Pension pots were poured into high-risk and complex products suitable only for professionals. The scammers then plundered the funds for huge commissions and savers who tried to withdraw what remained of their money faced crippling exit fees.

Susan Monaghan, who was one of the victims, said: ‘This formula is used over and over again in offshore financial services – and it makes plenty of commission for everyone involved but destroys the fund for the investors.

‘Being listed with HMRC lends credibility and that gave people reassurance.’ The Maltese authorities are considering 50 complaints about the Momentum Malta Retirement Trust, which accepted clients from CWM.

Miss Monaghan accused Momentum of failing in its ‘duty of care’ and allowing an insurance bond to be purchased that locked investors in for up to ten years and at great expense.

She added: ‘Momentum have known this for years with complaints being made as far back as early 2015 but they have continued doing the same thing since, allowing even more pensions to be destroyed.

‘They have allowed unqualified, unregulated firms to give investment instructions and despite seeing people’s funds go down, year on year, have done nothing.’

Julie Elsden, who lost almost her entire retirement fund after investing through Momentum with CWM, said she went ahead with her pension transfer only because it was HMRC approved.

She said CWM went to ‘great lengths’ to convince her of this and produced documentation with HMRC logos. ‘This situation has now left me with very little funds for my retirement,’ she added.

Stewart Davies, head of Momentum Pensions, said: ‘CWM collapsed over two years ago and since then, Momentum Pensions Malta – in conjunction with other advisers and trustees in the market – has assisted many consumers that have been affected.

‘We do not, and never have, provided investment advice and we do not choose or manage the assets which clients invest in.

‘Investment company documentation is also provided to all members at inception, which includes a clear cost disclosure and cancellation notice period.’

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘HMRC has done much to combat pension scams. We will continue to come down hard on scammers.’

It warns on its website that it is up to the person transferring their cash to check a scheme fulfils the criteria to be legitimate.

I put £64,000 in Malta scheme on HMRC’s list A grandfather lost most of his £64,000 pension pot after being persuaded to switch to an overseas scheme recognised and listed by HMRC. Derrick Towlson, a former plumber and heating engineer, moved his money to the Malta-based scheme after being cold-called in 2013 by Continental Wealth Management. The 63-year-old said the ‘big selling point’ was that the money would be put into the Momentum Malta Retirement Trust which is on HMRC’s list of recognised overseas schemes. Derrick Towlson (pictured with wife Carol), 63, lost most of his £64,000 pension pot after being persuaded to switch to an overseas scheme recognised by HMRC. While he was told told his savings would grow to £80,000, he only got £19,000 He was told his savings would have grown to £80,000 by the end of this year – instead he has just £19,000. Mr Towlson, who lives with wife Carol near Colwyn Bay in North Wales, said he had to pay huge fees and some of his cash was lost in high-risk investments. He is now withdrawing the cash but exit fees will cost him another £4,000. ‘This is destroying lives,’ he said. ‘The UK government has left the doors wide open for fraud and scams. There is such a lack of control, it’s incredible. It’s so lax. It’s giving the UK a really bad name across the globe. ‘The HMRC listing was a big selling point. You think it must be OK.’ Momentum said all investment costs were fully disclosed and authorised and verified by the pension members and their advisers. It also said it took action as soon as it discovered the problems with CWM.

Ex-model’s champagne life as firm went bust

A company director accused of fleecing hundreds of Britons out of their pensions had ‘the sort of life most of us would give our right arm for’.

Jody Smart, also known as Jody Bell, flaunted her luxury lifestyle while customers of her Spanish-based firm Continental Wealth Management say they lost most of their retirement savings.

Many were persuaded to invest because CWM was listed on the HMRC website.

In September 2016 the former model appeared on the Channel 5 show How the Other Half Live – just a few months before her company went bust.

Jody Smart, also known as Jody Bell, ran Continental Wealth Management and left many people without their retirement savings. Three British claimants are pursuing combined £2.5million claims against Miss Smart, Mr Kirby and two others of aggravated fraud, fake accounting and belonging to a criminal organisation

Footage showed her at the Costa Blanca headquarters of CWM, which the programme said was worth £13million. She was also filmed enjoying a champagne picnic, driving a Mercedes and showing off her floor-to-ceiling shoe collection.

Presenter Eamonn Holmes told viewers: ‘The corporate world has given Jody the sort of life that most of us would give our right arm for. A stunning house in Spain, fast cars and a vast shoe collection.’

She was on the show to promote her fashion company, Jody Bell SL, which was funded almost entirely with money from CWM. The cash helped pay for her to travel to New York Fashion Week to present her outfits. A mother of two, she grew up in Herefordshire before moving to Spain where she started a relationship with CWM founder Darren Kirby.

Despite having no financial qualifications or experience, she became the sole director of the company. She was paid a salary of £122,000 a year, a Spanish court heard last month.

Three British claimants are pursuing combined £2.5million claims against Miss Smart, Mr Kirby and two others of aggravated fraud, fake accounting and belonging to a criminal organisation. The court has heard that when CWM went bust it had just £56,000 in the bank.

Yet from 2015 to 2017, hundreds of thousands of pounds was paid to her fashion label and to a property holding company registered in her name.

Miss Smart denied ever dealing with clients or having anything to do with the running of CWM other than promoting it in the Spanish media.

She said she visited the office in Denia occasionally because it had a room where she kept her designer clothes.

She and Mr Kirby, who did not respond to a court summons for cross-examination, did not answer requests for comment."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Environment Canada issued a rainfall warning for parts of the West Island as a frontal system dumped rainfall totals near 100 millimetres Tuesday. The South Island will not see as much rainfall, but it is going to be wet as we welcome the New Year.

""Today is a wet one and at the end of the week we have another wet pulse to contend with,"" said Environment Canada meteorologist Armel Castellan. ""Having started overnight, somewhere around 15 to 20 millimetres is the best estimate for this particular storm and then we have probably a similar amount coming up for Thursday and Friday.""

The rain will taper off later Wednesday but will begin to fall mid-day Thursday and last into Friday. The rain is expected to stop by Friday evening.

""Those first few days are a mixed bag so we will definitely see a little bit of a drying trend before the end of the week gets really wet again,"" said Castellan. ""This is an active stretch and we haven't had too much of it this fall and winter so this is kind is kind of making up for what we have been missing.""

Accumulations of rainfall can change very rapidly when you get into the mountains. Areas around the Sooke watershed and the Malahat will see more rainfall than in Greater Victoria. Treacherous driving conditions can be expected on the Malahat, Sutton Pass and the Port Alberni Summit.

""There are many locations on the island where just a few hundred metres makes a big difference in what you are going to encounter driving on those highways,"" said Castellan.

The western side of Vancouver Island has already experienced very heavy rain that may have caused flooding in low-lying areas. As much as 100 millimetres fell in the past 12 hours with an intensity of 15 millimetres an hour in some areas.

""When we see intensities of rain this strong and lasting for many hours, those are the types of concerns that are certainly on emergency management perspectives on what could and might happen,"" said Castellan.

Iran hit out Tuesday at the “audacity” of United States to blame it for violent anti-US demonstrations in Iraq, warning the United States to review its policies in the region.

“The surprising audacity of American officials is so much that after killing at least 25… and violating the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, that now… they attribute the Iraqi people’s protest against their cruel acts to the Islamic Republic of Iran,” said foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi.

His statement came after US President Donald Trump accused Iran of killing an American civilian contractor and “orchestrating” the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad earlier on Tuesday.

Mousavi said the claim was an insult to the people of Iraq.

“How and based on what logic do you expect the nation of Iraq to be silent in the face of all these atrocities?” he asked.

In response to rocket attacks that killed the contractor in northern Iraq, the US launched air strikes Sunday on an Iran-backed militant group that killed 25 people in western Iraq.

“The Americans ignore the Iraqi nation’s liberty and drive for independence on one hand, and on the other forget their own role in supporting Saddam and Daesh,” Mousavi said, referring to former dictator Saddam Hussein and the Islamic State group.

The statement rejected US charges against Iran, warned against any “reckless and wrong reaction” and urged the White House to “reconsider its destructive policies in the region”.

'218 such (local) youths joined militant outfits in 2018 but only 139 joined in 2019,' he said. Out of these new recruits only 89 have survived.

'The rest have been eliminated as their shelf life is between 24 hours to 2-3 months after joining militancy. There are hardly few old terrorists surviving, which include Jehangir Saroori and Riyaz Nayikoo', he said.

There have been only 481 law and order incidents this year as compared to 625 last year, he said There were 80 per cent successful anti-terror operations in which 160 terrorists, including foreigners, have been killed during the year.

Singh said 102 terrorists have been arrested and 10 terrorists surrendered during the year.

He said that 102 Pakistan origin terrorists are still operating in Kashmir.

'Eleven valiant police personnel from Jammu and Kashmir besides 72 from other other security forces have been martyred,' he said.

There was no collateral damage during anti-terror operation as people fully cooperated. 'There was zero law and order problem this year (during anti terror operations),' he added.

The DGP said that 'there has been a high degree of incidents of infiltration attempts from across the border this year and also ceasefire violations. But security forces have successfully foiled these attempted as 130 infiltrators have entered in 2019 as compared to 143 last year'.

He said Jammu and Kashmir Police has set an example by handling the law and order situation in the most 'exemplary' way following the abrogation of Article 370 provisions.

It was the biggest challenge faced by the force in 2019, but 'we handled the most critical phase in the best way' and there was no civilian casualty during the period, he said.

Dismissing claims of minors being arrested by police in Kashmir, he said that it is being used as propaganda by some people and asserted that the J-K police has acted within the limits of law.

'We are open to scrutiny. The issue reached the Supreme Court which referred it to Jammu and Kashmir high court. The matter was inquired by the HC committee. The SC said that there is no misuse of law by law enforcement agency. J-K police has acted within the limits of law,' he said.

Replying to queries on restoration of internet, the DGP said it is under consideration.

'I think J-K is moving towards such a situation (on law and order front). Very soon you will hear positive announcement,' Singh said.

He said that though some people will try to misuse internet, 'in the past, we took care of them and we will take care of such people in the future too'.

Internet services in all government-run hospitals and SMS to all mobile phones will be restored from December 31 midnight in the Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Kashmir official spokesman Rohit Kansal said on Tuesday.

On December 10, some short message service (SMS) were enabled on mobile phones in order to facilitate students, scholarship applicants, traders and others. It has now been decided to fully restore the service throughout Kashmir from midnight of December 31, Kansal said.

Mobile Internet services were restored in Kargil district of Ladakh on Friday after remaining suspended for 145 days in the wake of the Centre abrogating provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, officials said.

Internet services were suspended on August 4, a day before the Centre announced abrogation of Article 370 and division of the state into the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. PTI AB RT", Accuse of aggression,3

662,cab7c9098ead050b7498cb03ff420e91,"(CNN) — An immigration judge has granted asylum to a Connecticut high school student whose arrest sparked an outpouring of support from teachers and classmates.

Mario Aguilar, 18, was released from ICE custody Tuesday afternoon, hours after supporters held a news conference calling for release.

“He is on his way home,” attorney Dalia Fuleihan wrote in an email to CNN.

After ICE arrested Aguilar in September, teachers sent him schoolwork so he wouldn’t fall behind and traveled to court hearings so he’d see a friendly face.

Students saved his seat, made “Free Mario” signs in the school’s print shop and rallied for his release.

The community at Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven, Connecticut, which CNN featured in a story earlier this month, had been anxiously awaiting a ruling in the case for weeks.

Aguilar’s supporters said they’d finally gotten good news Monday when attorneys received written notice of the judge’s ruling.

By Tuesday, community leaders speaking to reporters from CNN affiliate WFSB and other local media at a City Hall news conference cautioned that the court decision was only a partial victory. Advocates said they were worried the teen could spend months longer behind bars if the government decided to appeal the judge’s decision.

Fuleihan said Tuesday evening it’s still unclear whether the Department of Homeland Security will appeal.

ICE has 30 days to decide whether to appeal

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman said the agency “does not comment on issues/claims/allegations not related to a detainee’s enforcement status without a signed privacy waiver from the individual.”

ICE attorneys have 30 days after a ruling to tell a judge whether they’ll appeal. If they appeal, proceedings could continue for up to a year, Fuleihan said.

Aguilar was born in Guatemala and came to the United States as an unaccompanied minor in 2018. His attorneys say he was fleeing persecution and seeking safety.

ICE deportation officers arrested him in September outside a Connecticut courthouse where he’d gone to face charges after a car accident, including driving under the influence, operating a motor vehicle without a license and failure to insure a private motor vehicle.

An ICE spokesman told CNN earlier this month that he’d been arrested for immigration violations and that removal proceedings were pending.

Advocates for Aguilar say he crashed into a parked car after his cell phone slid off the dashboard and he reached down to pick it up. They argue a sobriety test was never performed and the DUI charge wouldn’t have held up in court.

They’ve been pushing for months for ICE to release him, arguing he’s not dangerous or a flight risk — and deserves to return to his community and continue his studies.

He never got the schoolwork teachers sent

Ann Brillante, an assistant principal at Wilbur Cross, told CNN that teachers at the school have a good reason to want their student back in class.

“It’s urgent,” she said. “Every minute counts in terms of learning English and in terms of progressing towards graduation.”

Teachers told CNN they were devastated to learn recently that the homework they sent never made it to their student. An envelope filled with worksheets was returned to Aguilar’s attorney, stamped “Return to sender. Refused.” A handwritten note on the stamp said, “Unknown name” and “ID# required.”

Without being able to keep up with his schoolwork while detained, Aguilar is behind in his classes, Brillante said. But teachers, she said, will do everything they can to help him get on track.

“When he gets back, he gets a clean slate,” she said.

For students, the case has been an education unlike anything inside a textbook, the school’s principal told reporters Tuesday.

“It is a wonderful lesson, I think, in civics for all of our students to learn about our systems, and even the broken parts of our system that need to be fixed,” Principal Edith Johnson said. “And I know that this beautiful group of students that I lead in that school will be a part of mending a broken system.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

Police believe the 51-year-old was stabbed to death shortly after 11pm in Campbell St, Wonoona.

Officers made the horror discovery after they arrested a man who attempted to flee a random breath test station on Nicholson St.

As police approached, the vehicle drove off before hitting a guard rail nearby. The driver, a 56-year-old man, was arrested at the scene.

After speaking with the man, other officers went to the Campbell St home where they found a 51-year-old woman with multiple stab wounds.

She was unable to be revived.

The street has been cordoned off as crime scene investigators collect evidence and canvass for witnesses.

“I was lying in bed reading until 11pm, but I didn’t hear anything,” one neighbour, who did not wish to be named, told the Illawarra Mercury.

“It is confronting. We live in a usually quiet townhouse complex. It is a bit of drama for New Year’s Day.”

Wollongong police Inspector Angela Burnell called the woman’s death a “tragic start to the New Year”.

“Our thoughts go out to the family,” she told reporters.

“Crime scene investigators are continuing with their inquiries. Police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.”

The arrested man had been under police guard in hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries related to the crash.

Wollongong detectives have established Strike Force Carrela to investigate the circumstances surrounding the woman’s death.

Following inquiries, the man was charged with murder.

He was refused bail to appear at Wollongong Local Court on Thursday.

Family members of Ivy Kohn Reed and Rick Reed have revealed the pair are making good progress in the burns unit at Auckland's Middlemore Hospital.

The pair were among a tour party which was heading towards a jetty on the volcanic island off the Bay of Plenty coastline when it erupted on December 9.

Family members recently arrived in Auckland to be at their bedside, providing an update on a GoFundMe page set up to raise funds for their care, and to cover expenses as they recover.

""They reported that Ivy had another procedure done to graft skin around her head and neck,"" the update read.

""They also said Rick looked good. Both his legs and arms remain wrapped but no burns on his face. He was up and alert. Overall both seemed to be in good spirits.""

The update said Rick was due to undergo another procedure on Friday. After that, ""his recovery from that will likely determine the time frame"".

It added that Ivy had also been able to correspond via social media.

An earlier update posted on the fundraising page by Rick's son, Mike, read it was unlikely the pair would have to undergo any more ""major"" surgeries.

""All of Dad's grafting has taken except for a tiny part of his finger, but this is minor,"" Mike said.

""Ivy had a bit more operating on her hands recently but this seems to have all taken properly.

""So at this point, a few weeks of rest before they can be flown to DC/Maryland medical care is what the most current prognosis is. We don't want to set specific dates, as we don't want to give anyone false hopes of an exact return home.

""There is still a lot of recovery and physical therapy involved, but they have taken many steps in the right direction.

""The lead surgeon's team has been truly professional and meticulous with ensuring the procedures yield desired results. When this medical team is confident in flying Dad and Ivy home, they will give the green light. So we'll continue to stay patient and wait for their update.""

Mike Reed is based in Australia and had previously flown to Auckland to be with his badly injured loved ones.

In an update after a visit on December 17, an update on the GoFundMe page revealed that one of his father's surgeries had been 12 hours long.

""Rick had full skin grafting on his legs, arms and hands. Ivy also went in for another operation on her hands, not sure if grafting was involved again,"" the message said.

""The staff said Rick is feeling better after a rough night post-surgery. Hopefully he continues to make positive steps. So, this is still very much a day-by-day situation. Progress is being made, but it's a long road to recovery. I will post updates as information becomes available. Please continue to pray for Ivy and Rick.""

Rick suffered burns to 30 per cent of his body in the tragedy, affecting his hands, legs and face. Ivy suffered burns to 20 per cent of her body; primarily her right leg, as well as her hands and face.

After the volcanic explosion, Ivy's brother Barry Kohn told American media that timing had played a huge part in the pair surviving the initial volcanic eruption.

""Their tour group had already visited the crater, so they were walking away,"" he said. ""Which is, in essence, what probably saved their lives — that they were a little further away."""," Physically assault, not specified below",3

950,17a418f1179c5b6e9e29273ce9443c57,"A Virginian governor refused to resign, the President got impeached, and there was a government shutdown or two. Welcome to DC, everybody.

WASHINGTON — When you live in the nation's Capitol, being surrounded by politics and legislation is second nature. While D.C. does get a rep of being a town embroiled with probes and investigations, it's true that 2019 has been nothing short of eventful in the District.

January kicked off with the longest U.S. government shutdown in history, impacting hundreds of thousands, from furloughed government employees to local businesses. But the rest of 2019 seemed to follow suit in terms of action, with Virginia legislation changing parties, Russian interference with local elections and even a blackface scandal.

From the personal testimonies of furloughed workers to D.C. considering statehood, here is a look back on the nine most-read political articles WUSA9 has reported this year.

Volunteers from celebrity chef Jose Andres' World Central Kitchen fed thousands of people in need, not in some far off flood zone, but right here in Washington at a small store front at the Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Many of the furloughed federal workers and contractors said soup, a sandwich, and a power bowl can make a huge difference when there's no money coming in.

Royce Powers, furloughed from the Justice Department, broke down in tears as she contemplated another two weeks without a paycheck.

Virginia’s Attorney General gave his legal opinion on a growing movement among Virginia cities and counties to declare themselves second amendment sanctuaries, rather than abide by new gun control legislation.

AG Mark Herring said state laws can’t be ignored by local governments.

""When the General Assembly passes new gun violence legislation, they will be followed, and they will be enforced,"" Herring said.

The new gun safety proposals include universal background checks, re-instating a one gun per month law and a red flag law aimed at reducing the risk of someone in crisis hurting themselves or others.

Russian hackers with the Kremlin’s military intelligence unit targeted Virginia’s election infrastructure in 2016 – a cyber operation now confirmed by current and former state election officials.

The Russian effort searched for vulnerabilities within Virginia’s online election infrastructure, authorities familiar with the matter said. The specific Russian actions targeting Virginia have not been previously reported.

Analysts within the Department of Homeland Security eventually traced the suspicious activity to the GRU, the Russian military spy agency.

Democrats won majorities in both the state Senate and House of Delegates in Tuesday's elections. It marks the first time since 1993 that Democrats will control the General Assembly and the Governor's mansion.

Democrats needed to flip two seats in the House of Delegates and one seat in the Senate for Virginia to become the only Southern state under Democratic control of the executive and legislative branches.

Pivotal races included Democratic Del. John Bell defeating Republican Geary Higgins in a Senate race in Loudoun, Prince William counties and Democratic challenger Dan Helmer defeated Republican incumbent Del. Tim Hugo in Fairfax, Prince William counties.

President Donald Trump blasted the late John McCain on Wednesday, going as far to claim credit for the senator’s funeral in Washington and complaining he was never thanked.

""I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted,"" Trump told reporters at a campaign-style rally in Lima, Ohio, according to the Associated Press. ""I didn't get (a) thank you but that's OK.""

The Washington National Cathedral, which hosted the late senator’s funeral service, issued a statement on Thursday in response disputing the president’s involvement.

“Washington National Cathedral was honored to host the funeral service for Senator John McCain. All funerals and memorial services at the Cathedral are organized by the family of the deceased; only a state funeral for a former president involves consultation with government officials,” representatives wrote in a release. “No funeral at the Cathedral requires the approval of the president or any other government official.”

Investigators led by a former Virginia attorney general could not say for sure whether Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is pictured in a now-infamous blackface photograph, releasing an inconclusive 36-page report Wednesday on the political bombshell.

The probe centered on a conservative website's post Feb 1 of a photograph with two men at a party, one in blackface and his companion in a Ku Klux Klan costume, from Northam’s 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook. The revelation thrust the Democratic governor into the national spotlight with many calling for his resignation.

But Northam maintained in two separate interviews with investigators from Richmond, Va., law firm McGuireWoods that he was not in either racially offensive costume. Richard Cullen, a lawyer at McGuireWoods and Virginia's attorney general in 1997 and 1998, led the inquiry.

The U.S. House of Representatives held the first hearing on D.C. statehood in 26 years. It was the first step in the process to accomplish the passing of H.R. 51, or the Washington, D.C. Admission Act.

More than 700,000 D.C. residents pay federal taxes but don’t have equal representation in the national government. Here in the District, the majority of voters -- 86 percent, according to the D.C. Statehood office -- appear to support statehood. In 2016, D.C. residents passed a referendum supporting statehood.

The bill under consideration allows for people who live in the ""new"" smaller federal district to be allowed to vote for the president in the state they most recently lived in.

Virginia Delegate Ibraheem Samirah said he was excited about his first town hall.

""It was my first town hall ever,"" he said.



However, that excitement quickly turned to concern during the question and answer session.

""The first question that pops up; 'How do you plan to implement Sharia Law in Virginia?'"" Samirah recalled.



Samirah said he felt targeted because he's Muslim.

Congressman Elijah Cummings died Oct. 17, according to an official from his office. Congressman Cummings passed away at Johns Hopkins hospital due to complications concerning longstanding health challenges.

By Andrew Chung

(Reuters) - U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concern on Tuesday about disinformation amplified by the internet and social media as he focused his year-end report on the weakening state of civics education in the United States.

""In our age, when social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand scale, the public's need to understand our government, and the protections it provides, is ever more vital,"" Roberts said in his annual report on behalf of the federal judiciary.

The chief justice warned that Americans ""have come to take democracy for granted, and civic education has fallen by the wayside.""

Roberts' comments come as U.S. legislators and officials have raised concerns about the persistence of foreign propaganda and false news aimed at sowing discord in the U.S. political system in the lead-up to the 2020 election.

U.S. intelligence agencies and an inquiry by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller found that Russia engaged in a campaign of hacking and propaganda to sway the 2016 presidential race toward Republican President Donald Trump. Mueller did not establish that members of Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election.

Roberts said in his report that an independent judiciary was a ""key source of national unity and stability"" and called on his judicial colleagues to promote public confidence and trust by reflecting on their duty to judge without fear or favor.

He has previously lamented the perception in an increasingly polarized society that lower courts and the Supreme Court are becoming politicized, and that judges are guided primarily by their partisan affiliations.

Trump has repeatedly criticized federal courts and judges who have blocked his policies, while some Democratic lawmakers have suggested that the Supreme Court's conservative majority is motivated mainly by politics instead of interpreting the law.

Roberts, 64, named to the court in 2005 by Republican President George W. Bush, is poised to preside over Trump's looming U.S. Senate impeachment trial, a highly visible yet largely ceremonial role.

By the end of June, the Supreme Court is expected to decide several major cases involving a number of hot-button issues including abortion rights, Trump's move to kill a program that protects young immigrants, dubbed ""Dreamers,"" who were brought to the United States illegally as children, and Trump’s bid to keep details of his finances secret.

Roberts listed in his report a number of ways his judicial colleagues had helped advance public understanding of the law and civics knowledge.

He cited the example of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, who volunteers as a tutor at a local elementary school. Garland's 2016 nomination to the Supreme Court by Democratic President Barack Obama was not taken up by the Republican-controlled Senate.

Roberts' annual report was released just a few days after the death of his mother, Rosemary Roberts, who died on Saturday at age 90.

Moreover, Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi has also urged protesters to end the violent siege of the American embassy in Baghdad and stressed that ""aggression against embassies was an act that security forces would not tolerate.""

Dozens of protesters broke into the US embassy compound in Baghdad, smashed windows, set fire to outbuildings and overturned vehicles outside the US Embassy, CNN reported.

1209,bd83babdfb6a65bfdcde28120d06c969,"Speaking to reporters just hours after dozens of Iran-backed Iraqi Shiite militiamen and their supporters broke into the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, President Trump on Tuesday night vowed that the situation ""will not be a Benghazi"" -- a pointed reference to the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya on the Obama administration's watch, after officials at the compound had requested enhanced security for weeks.

""It's been handled very well,"" Trump said as he walked into New Year's Eve celebrations at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. ""The Marines came in. We had some great warriors come in; they did a fantastic job. They were there instantaneously, as soon as we heard. They came immediately. It's in great shape. This will not be a Benghazi. Benghazi never should have happened. This will never, ever be a Benghazi. ... As soon as we saw there was a potential for a problem, they got in.""

Trump added: ""Things are in great shape. ... I want to thank the Iraqi government. They really stepped up.""

""This will not be a Benghazi. Benghazi never should have happened."" — President Trump

Iran, Trump said, ""should want peace more than anybody,"" and any conflict ""would go very quickly."" But, Trump said he did not see such a fight materializing, even as he unequivocally pointed the finger at Iran for the embassy breach.

Meanwhile, multiple media outlets, including The New York Times, inexplicably opted to describe the embassy attackers simply as ""Iraqi mourners.""

Separately, Trump told reporters he was not worried about what he called Democrats' impeachment ""hoax,"" pointing out that Ukraine's leader has said he felt no pressure from the White House to launch any political investigations.

Trump slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as ""a highly overrated person"" and said he would be happy to have a Senate trial, although he emphasized he didn't really care one way or the other.

The president went on to defend his brief suspension of foreign aid to Ukraine this year -- which Democrats have claimed was an attempt to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden -- by asking why other countries did not provide anything near the level of foreign aid that the U.S. regularly provided: ""Why is it always the United States? Nobody ever covers that, but I think it's a big factor.""

The president also said he had a strong relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has signaled he might soon give Trump a Christmas present in the form of renewed missile tests.

""I hope his Christmas present is a beautiful vase,"" Trump said. ""Look, he likes me, I like him. We get along. He's representing his country, I'm representing my country, we have to do what we have to do. But, he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization.""

Trump didn't disclose his New Year's resolution, though -- saying he thought those should generally be kept private.

""Happy New Year,"" Trump said. ""We're gonna have a great year.""

A U.S. official told Fox News earlier in the day that ""Iraqi security forces did participate"" in protecting the embassy — and Trump made clear he expected Iraq to secure U.S. personnel.

“[W]e expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!” Trump wrote in a Tuesday afternoon tweet blaming Iran. He also spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi, stressing again the need to protect U.S. facilities in Iraq.

Trump explicitly warned Iran on Twitter that the country ""will pay a very BIG PRICE!"" after the embassy attack. ""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,"" he wrote. ""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!""

BENGHAZI TEAM MEMBER CALLS IRAQ'S RESPONSE TO EMBASSY ATTACK A 'SLAP IN THE FACE'

Militants smashed a main door at the embassy and set fire to a reception area in one of the worst attacks on the embassy in recent years. Fox News has learned more than 100 Marines have arrived at the embassy to bolster security.

Additionally, the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division’s alert brigade has been issued orders to deploy rapidly to Kuwait amid the unrest in Baghdad, three U.S. defense officials told Fox News. At least 500 paratroopers already were making their way to Kuwait, Fox News was told.

The alert brigade of roughly 4,000 paratroopers, known as the DRB—the Deployment Ready Brigade -- has been told to pack their bags for a possible deployment in the days ahead. Within that alert brigade, three rifle battalions had a certain alert sequence, 18 hours, 36 hours and 54 hours for the third. The entire brigade had a 96-hour alert window to deploy.

Some of the paratroopers already have left their base in Fort Bragg, N.C., to fly overseas in Air Force C-17 cargo planes, according to officials. The U.S. Army, as a matter of course, has kept an alert brigade of roughly 4,000 paratroopers in the 82nd Airborne for crisis response. Roughly 5,000 U.S. troops had been deployed to Iraq, among the roughly 60,000 U.S. troops deployed to the entire region. The Pentagon has added some 14,000 since May as the threat from Iran increased, officials said.

ST. CLOUD — The holidays are coming to a close. Visiting family is gone, you've done most of the dishes, and your Christmas tree is starting to drop needles all over the living room.

Once you get all the decorations put away, it's time to get rid of the tree. Depending on where you live, there are several different ways to dispose of it properly.

This year proper disposal is especially important, as the Minnesota Department of Agriculture has warned of an invasive pest that could hitchhike into Minnesotan farms, according to a Dec. 20 release.

Elongate hemlock scale — a small insect that feeds on the needles of hemlocks, firs and spruces — has been found on holiday greenery in the northeastern United States.

The Department of Agriculture recommends using city- or county-organized pickup or drop-off services or, if there are none in your area, burning your tree. Do not dump greenery into wooded areas or personal compost piles, the department advises.

If you notice an invasive pest or disease on your tree, you can contact the Department of Agriculture's Arrest the Pest line at 888-545-6684 or via email at arrest.the.pest@state.mn.us.

Here's how you can dispose of your tree properly in metro-area cities:

St. Cloud

Place your tree outside for collection crews before pickup times at 6 a.m. Monday, Jan. 6 and Monday, Jan. 13, according to the city website.

Trees must have all decorations, stands and other attachments removed, and be marked with a clear or green city yard waste bag. Wreaths are not accepted because of their wire frames.

Sartell

The compost site will be open 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 4 at 520-30th Ave. N, said Public Works Director John Kothenbeutel. The compost site will take your tree in exchange for a non-perishable food donation.

Sauk Rapids

Sauk Rapids' compost site will be open two times, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 4 and Saturday, Jan. 11, according to the city website.

The compost site, at 3135 Quarry Road NE, also composts your tree for a canned good donation.

Waite Park

City crews will be picking up trees between Jan. 13 and 17, according to Media Publications Coordinator Margie Wolf. The city asks people to remove all decorations and have their trees by the curb before 7 a.m. Monday, Jan. 13.

St. Joseph

St. Joseph residents should have their trees out on the curb without any bags, decorations or stands before 6 a.m. Thursday, Jan. 9, according to Public Works Director Terry Thene.

1250,207d1a44171b0a07f712f43c835a04c5,"TAIPEI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday the island would not accept a ""one country, two systems"" political formula Beijing has suggested could be used to unify the democratic island, saying such an arrangement had failed in Hong Kong.

China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary. Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

Tsai, who's seeking re-election in a Jan. 11 vote, also vowed in a New Year's speech to defend Taiwan's sovereignty, saying her government would build a mechanism to safeguard freedom and democracy as Beijing ramps up pressure on the island.

Fear of China has become a major element in the campaign, boosted by months of anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.

""Hong Kong people have showed us that 'one country, two systems' is definitely not feasible,"" Tsai said, referring to the political arrangement that guaranteed certain freedoms in the former British colony of Hong Kong after it was returned to China in 1997.

""Under 'one country, two systems', the situation continues to deteriorate in Hong Kong. The credibility of 'one country, two systems' has been sullied by the government's abuse of power,"" Tsai said.

Hong Kong has been hit by months of anti-government protests triggered by widespread resentment of perceived efforts by Beijing to exert control of the city despite the promises of autonomy.

Taiwan's parliament passed an anti-infiltration law on Tuesday to combat perceived threats from China, further straining ties between Taiwan and Beijing.

Tsai said the law will protect Taiwan's democracy and cross-strait exchanges will not be affected amid worries that the legislation may damage business ties with China.

China suspects Tsai and her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party of pushing for the island's formal independence, and has threatened it with war if there was any such move.

Tsai denies seeking independence and reiterated that she would not unilaterally change the status quo with China. (Reporting By Yimou Lee; Editing by Kim Coghill)"," Threaten, not specified below",3
1296,113990a655425cd8e0b3d098b288a71d,"BAGHDAD: Iraqi supporters of pro-Iran factions attacked the US Embassy here on Tuesday, breaching its outer wall and chanting ""Death to America!"" in anger over weekend air strikes that killed two dozen fighters.

It was the first time in years protesters have been able to reach the US embassy, which is sheltered behind a series of checkpoints in the high-security Green Zone. A stream of men in military fatigues, as well as some women, marched through those checkpoints to the embassy walls with no apparent reaction from the Iraqi security forces. The demonstrators threw rocks and wrenched security cameras off the walls, ignoring calls over megaphones to leave the embassy compound.

In response, US guards fired an initial volley of bullets, then switched to tear gas and flash bang stun grenades to disperse thecrowd. The Hashed said at least 62 people were wounded.

Caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said the crowds that had stormed the US embassy should leave the compound ""immediately"". ""We recall that any aggression or harassment of foreign embassies will be firmly prohibited by the security forces,"" Abdel Mahdi´s office said several hours after the attack began.

Following his statement, some of the crowd pulled back but others set up tents, swearing to pursue a sit-in. The demonstrators were protesting US air strikes that killed at least 25 fighters from a hardline Hashed faction known as Kataeb Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades) on Sunday. Meanwhile, the government warned that its relations with the United States were at risk after the deadly US air strikes against sparked anger on the streets.

Baghdad said it would summon the US ambassador while Washington responded by accusing Iraqi authorities of having failed to ""protect"" US interests. ""American forces acted on their political priorities, not those of the Iraqis,"" a statement said, adding that such strikes ""violate the sovereignty of Iraq"".

The attacks ""force Iraq to review its relations and its security, political and legal framework to protect its sovereignty"", the government added. US President Donald Trump in a Twitter message accused Iran of ""orchestrating"" the attack and said it ""will be held fully responsible"", but he also said he expected Iraq ""to use its forces to protect the embassy"".

""It´s their responsibility and duty to protect us. And they have not taken the appropriate steps to do so,"" a senior State Department official said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iraq that Washington will ""defend its people"".

In phone calls with both Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and President Barham Saleh, Pompeo ""made clear the United States will protect and defend its people, who are there to support a sovereign and independent Iraq,"" the State Department said in a statement. Both Abdel Mahdi and Saleh assured Pompeo ""that they took seriously their responsibility for and would guarantee the safety and security of US personnel and property,"" the statement said. Saudi Arabia Tuesday voiced ""great concern"" over attacks against American forces in Iraq, which Washington has blamed on pro-Iran factions, state media reported.

The prime minister’s office and special advisers should lead fundamental reforms needed to unlock the potential of the civil service, according to the Policy Exchange think tank.

In a briefing which highlights Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, among its sources, the think tank outlines how the civil service should be changed.

It warns that the civil service is under “unprecedented strain” and needs to modernise to face the challenges of a post-Brexit Britain.

Proposed reforms include a complete overhaul of the existing public appointments process to allow ministers to appoint their preferred candidates and prevent a majority of important public roles being handed to “ideological opponents.”

RELATED CONTENT

A “more professionalised approach” with “effective involvement and ownership by ministers and special advisers from the outset” is needed.

Among the recommendations is a call for the restoration of the coalition government era reform from 2013 to 2017 of extended ministerial offices, which is intended to provide significantly increased policy making capacity for departmental ministers. This move was designed to bolster the support available to ministers and introduce new thinking into departments, but some critics argued that it risked politicising the civil service and driving a wedge between ministers and their permanent staff.

Policy Exchange also called for the creation of a dedicated ‘red team’ of “10-15 high calibre individuals” should be created “with an explicit mandate to challenge received wisdom and critically examine new policy proposals in No. 10, Treasury and government departments.”

Such a proposal has been among Cummings’ recommendations for government reform, and he is expected to lead a review into the civil service following a wide-ranging government reshuffle in the new year.

Policy Exchange said that the head of the Red Team should report directly to the prime minister’s chief of staff, while it also called for the economic and domestic affairs secretariat should be moved from the Cabinet Office to No. 10, “uniting central policy making functions under the prime minister.”

The Whitehall Reimagined briefing paper also proposed that civil service recruitment and progression should be reformed “to enhance expertise, accountability and institutional memory” and the paper recommended a restoration of pay progression in post for civil servants who are delivering effectively.

It also made a number of recommendations are also made to reform of the public appointments process though “a more rigorous assessment of candidates both for experience and ability and to ensure their approach to their roles will align with that of the democratically elected government of the day.”

This should include the creation of a “dedicated public appointments process to be established within No.10, headed by special advisers” and able to “veto appointments where necessary.”

The process should be “significantly more flexible, including the ability to appoint individuals with a strong public record on the basis of that record alone.”

Writing in the foreword, Dame Patricia Hodgson, former chair of Ofcom, said: “Whitehall needs more access to talent, streamlined processes and the confidence to work closely with outside experts and with political advisers able to provide improved support for ministers, including junior ministers.”

She added: “Civil service systems and structures should be aligned with those used in the most effective organisations.”

When it comes to attracting talent, “current senior recruitment processes to public bodies seem almost designed to fail.”

Headhunters should be used to find the best candidates and appointments to public bodies should be speeded up, she said.

“This paper is designed not to overturn the civil service, but to strengthen it. The civil service can only deliver if we recruit the best, require the best and properly manage and reward the best.”

Reorganisation plans

The paper comes after several recent media reports claiming Boris Johnson is planning to restructure several government departments.

Responsibility for Britain’s borders and immigration system could be taken from the Home Office and placed in a standalone department, while the Department for International Trade could merge with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

Climate change policy could be moved from BEIS into a new ministerial department, while the Department for International Development could be absorbed by the Foreign Office.

Other changes reportedly being discussed within government include giving the prime minister’s office more power and encouraging the recruitment of external experts into the civil service.

The Policy Exchange briefing echoes the recent reports and recommends merging the Department for International Development and the Department for International Trade into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and creating a Department for the Union to “provide a coherent voice within Whitehall, with the devolved governments and across the UK on union matters.”

When it comes to public procurement, “from the bankruptcy of Carillion in 2017 to the ongoing problems with escalating cost of High Speed 2, it is clear that there is something very wrong with the way that the machinery of government interacts with private commercial organisations.”

There is a “mismatch” between staff who “frequently do not have a commercial background” and “well-resourced commercial actors.” Although this is an area where reforms have already been made, though the creation of the Government Commercial Organisation for senior procurement professionals, there is a need for government to “go further in attracting and retaining commercial staff with significant performance-related remuneration and career progression incentives.”

'Dangers of reform'

Responding to the report, Dave Penman, FDA general secretary, described the briefing paper of seeking to “break the monopoly of advice from civil servants to ministers.”

He said: “Whether this is driven by ideological mistrust or a genuine attempt to improve the advice to ministers, it comes with a number of inherent dangers.”

Penman added: “The rehashing of Extended Ministerial Offices – increasing the number of political appointees around ministers – and the emphasis on greater external legal advice both smack of an ideological approach that seeks to dilute the role of the civil service.”

And moving to appoint advisers on the basis of their political persuasions “may be more likely to give the minister the advice they want rather than need, but that does not make for good government.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

Global Times

Source:Global Times Published: 2019/12/31 18:44:55

The island of Taiwan's ""anti-infiltration bill,"" which was passed on Tuesday by Taiwan legislative authority, is a move of ""green terror"" by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and will hurt the interests of Taiwan people, the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office said on Tuesday, adding that the bill is a bid to score political brownie points.

""[The DPP authorities] sabotaged cross-Straits communication and exchanges, triggered cross-Straits hostility and confrontation, hurt the feelings of the people on both sides, and seriously undermined the interests of Taiwan people,"" said Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office.

People from all walks of life within the island strongly condemned and are in opposition to the DPP's actions that are against the trend of the times and are deeply concerned about the consequences of sabotaging the peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, according to Zhu.

""We sternly warn the DPP authorities that no force will be able to change the will of compatriots on both sides and the fact that blood is thicker than water. If they wish to look out for one another, then no force will be able to change the trend of compatriots on both sides as they share the same fate,"" Zhu said.

Going against the interests of the people, creating wilful cross-Straits hostility and confrontation will definitely lead the DPP to fall victim to its evil deeds, Zhu said.

The ""anti-infiltration bill"" bans people on the Taiwan Island from receiving instructions, requests, financial aids or political donations from ""infiltrating sources,"" or taking part in election activities listed in the island's ""Civil Servants Election And Recall Act,"" media reported.

This includes any political party, organization, and individual that holds a position contradictory to the DPP, media that criticizes the DPP, Taiwan people who come to the Chinese mainland for education or work, including participants of cross-Straits communications and cooperation, said Zhu in a routine press conference held on December 25.

Violators will be sentenced to imprisonment of up to five years, besides fine of up to 10 million new Taiwan dollars ($334,600), reports said.

KMT party candidate Han Kuo-yu told media on Sunday that once the ""anti-infiltration bill"" is passed, people like (music band in Taiwan) Mayday and baker Wu Pao-chun (who has a bakery in Shanghai) might also be liable for prosecution.

This is like hanging bombs around the necks of Taiwan people, which the DPP can detonate at any time, Han said."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Paraguay is evaluating its local crypto sector in advance of new regulations

This local exploration will pave the way for the country’s first specific crypto regulations to be implemented in the first half of 2020. “The data obtained will be used to measure the degree of adoption, complexity, and size of the virtual asset market in Paraguay, with the purpose of drafting a policy document that regulates them adequately and mitigates the risk of misuse,” said Secretary Minister Christian Villanueva.

Never before this landlocked nation regulated cryptocurrencies. Although its central bank warned the public last June that only the Guarani currency is legal tender.

Crypto enthusiasts in Paraguay will not be very happy

Paraguay has largely avoided the problem. In a country dominated by unofficial business, the IMF estimated that informal employment accounts for “more than half” of total employment in Paraguay. The regulation of bitcoin was an afterthought.

The FATF’s regulatory guidelines of June 2019 increased pressure on Paraguay to develop cryptocurrency standards, according to Villanueva. Recommendation 15 of the FATF guidelines expanded the AML benchmarks to include technologies such as “virtual assets”.

Now, with its new directive, SEPRELAD puts Paraguay on the path of compliance with Recommendation 15 before the end of 2020. Miners, over-the-counter (OTC) shops, exchanges, and other PSAVs will have to register with the government. To implement basic supervision over their customers’ activities, with anti-terrorist financing (CFT) protocols and AML safeguards.

Paraguay is part of a growing trend of crypto regulations

Cryptocurrency has been an increasing focus of government and financial institutions. While crypto has yet to return to its highs of 2017 and 2018 many governments still consider it a threat to their own fiat currency and an easy way for criminals to conduct illegal activities.

Some nations, like Venezuela and China, have chosen to take control of the technology in an attempt to ensure that only government run crypto is used. Others, such as Canada, have opted to treat cryptocurrency like a security, which makes Bitcoin too burdensome to use a day to day currency, essentially eliminating the threat to the Canadian Dollar.

Despite this concerning trend of crypto regulation there are some positive signs. Germany has opened up the possibility of keeping cryptocurrency in an official state bank account, essentially legitimising the currency, without attempting to take direct control of its direction.

One thing is for certain, governments are finally beginning to take crypto seriously and 2020 may well be the year that crypto hits the mainstream, although it may not be in the way that crypto enthusiasts hoped it would.

She died of natural causes on December 27 in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area.

Rip currents are powerful, life-threatening channels of water flowing quickly away from shore. Dangerous rip currents are expected along east- and north-facing reefs.

Rip current tips:

Inexperienced swimmers shouldn’t enter the water.

Never swim alone.

If caught in a rip current, yell for help.

Remain calm and stay afloat while waiting for help.

If swimming out of a rip current, swim parallel to shore and back toward the beach; don’t attempt to swim directly against a rip current.

High surf

A high surf advisory also remains in effect for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan until 6 a.m. Friday. Hazardous surf of 8 to 10 feet along north- and east-facing reefs is expected.

There’s also a small-craft advisory in effect until 6 p.m. Friday for the coastal waters. Winds of 15 to 25 knots with combined seas of 9 to 11 feet will produce hazardous conditions to small craft. Inexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller vessels, should avoid boating.

BAGHDAD -- Angered by deadly airstrikes targeting an Iran-backed militia, dozens of Iraqi Shiite militiamen and their supporters broke into the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Tuesday, smashing a main door and setting fire to a reception area in one of the worst attacks on the embassy in recent memory.

American guards fired tear gas, and palls of smoke rose over the embassy grounds.

An Associated Press reporter at the scene saw flames rising from inside the compound and U.S. soldiers on the roof of the main embassy building with their guns pointed at protesters.

A man on a loudspeaker urged the mob not to enter the compound, saying, 'The message was delivered.'

There were no reports of casualties. The State Department said all American personnel were safe and that there were no plans to evacuate the embassy. The government planned to send more troops to protect the compound.

The breach followed U.S. airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The U.S. military said the strikes were in retaliation for last week's killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that the U.S. blamed on the militia.

President Donald Trump blamed Iran for the embassy breach and called on Iraq to protect the diplomatic mission.

'Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!"" he tweeted from his estate in Palm Beach, Florida.

By early evening, the protesters had retreated from the compound but set up several tents outside where they said they intended to stage a sit-in. Dozens of yellow flags belonging to Iran-backed Shiite militias fluttered atop the reception area and were plastered along the embassy's concrete wall along with anti-U.S. graffiti. American Apache helicopters flew overhead and dropped flares over the area.

Trump, who is spending the holiday week at his Florida home, is in 'close touch' and receiving regular updates from his national security team, said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. She echoed the sentiment contained in Trump's tweet earlier Tuesday.

'As the president said, Iran is orchestrating this attack, and they will be held fully responsible,' Grisham said in an emailed statement. 'It will be the president's choice how and when we respond to their escalation.'

The developments also represent a major downturn in Iraq-U.S. relations that could further undermine U.S. influence in the region and American troops in Iraq and weaken Washington's hand in its pressure campaign against Iran.

Iraq has long struggled to balance its ties with the U.S. and Iran, both allies of the Iraqi government. But the government's angry reaction to the U.S. airstrikes and its apparent decision not to prevent the protesters from reaching the embassy signaled a sharp deterioration of U.S.-Iraq relations.

Iraqi security forces made no effort to stop the protesters as they marched to the heavily fortified Green Zone after a funeral for those killed in the airstrikes. The demonstrators were allowed to pass through a security checkpoint leading to the area.

The marchers, many of them in militia uniforms, shouted 'Down, down USA!' and 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel' outside the compound, hurling water and stones over its walls. The mob set fire to three trailers used by security guards along the wall. AP journalists saw some try to scale the walls.

Others then smashed the gates used by cars to enter, and dozens pushed into the compound. The protesters stopped in a corridor after about 5 meters (16 feet), and were only about 200 meters away from the main building.

The sprawling embassy compound enjoys a prominent position on the banks of the Tigris River in the heart of the Iraqi capital. Resembling a fortified college campus, the complex is rimmed with thick blast walls and cylindrical watch towers, lending it the look of a modern-day castle.

Gates visitors use to enter the complex consist of an airlock-like vestibule fortified with heavy doors and bulletproof glass. Even if protesters breached the first set of doors, they would have to force past heavily armed military contractors and U.S. Marine guards and a second set of heavy doors before entering the main compound.

Numerous buildings are inside the walls, including dormitories for staff, well-stocked dining and recreation facilities, and a power station.

The protesters taunted the embassy's security staff, which remained behind glass windows in the gates' reception area. They hung a poster on the wall declaring 'America is an aggressor' and sprayed graffiti on the wall and windows reading, 'Closed in the name of the resistance.'

'This is a victory in retaliation to the American airstrike. This is the initial retaliation, God willing, there will be more,' said Mahmoud, a fighter with the Imam Ali Brigades who was carrying a black bag filled with electricity cables that he said he took from the reception area.

A video obtained by the AP showed militiamen trashing the reception area and taking away paperwork.

The embassy, on its Facebook page, urged American citizens not to approach the compound and 'to review their personal security and emergency preparedness.'

An Iraqi employee at the embassy told the AP that the embassy's security team had evacuated some local staff from a rear gate while others left by helicopters and the rest remained inside 'safe' areas within the embassy. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to speak to journalists.

The U.S. ambassador was traveling outside Iraq at the time of the attack and planned to return, the State Department said.

Some commanders of militia factions loyal to Iran joined the protesters outside the embassy in a strikingly bold move. Among them was Qais al-Khizali, the head of one of the most powerful Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq who is on a U.S. terror list, and Hadi al-Amiri, the head of the state-sanctioned paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units, the umbrella group for the Iran-backed militias.

Jaafar al-Husseini, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah, said the protesters had no intention of storming the embassy. He told the AP that the sit-in will continue 'until American troops leave Iraq and the embassy is closed.'

The U.S. airstrikes - the largest targeting an Iraqi state-sanctioned militia in recent years - and the subsequent calls by the militia for retaliation, represent a new escalation in the proxy war between the U.S. and Iran playing out in the Middle East.

The attack also outraged the Iraqi government, which said it will reconsider its relationship with the U.S.-led coalition - the first time it has said it will do so since an agreement was struck to keep some U.S. troops in the country. It called the attack a 'flagrant violation"" of its sovereignty.

He has also talked about putting an embassy in Tehran.

Hagel is no friend to Israel and has said that the State Department has become an adjunct to the Israeli Foreign Minister’s office. Hagel cannot remember making that statement though many others can.

He believes that if Israel is faced with an existential threat by Iran, the US shouldn’t be thinking about bombing Iran.

And that is me–as a distant bystander in Sydney. Affected by the chronic smoke levels which have been spoiling the air and usual blue skies of the harbour city for weeks, yet far from the front-line of terror and hellish scenarios which are threatening any minute to extinguish entire towns.

As the New Year approached, instead of making plans to head off to see the controversial Sydney fireworks display with friends, I was sobbing, uncontrollably, before my screen, reading the latest news of a terrifyingly escalating situation, spinning way out of control.

Images like this are saturating social media in Australia as the fires force thousands to take ... [+] refuge on the coastline in the East Gippsland region of the Victorian and NSW coastline. Authorities for days have been warning up to 30,000 tourists enjoying Australia's summer holidays to leave the area, just one of the hundreds ravaged by this devastating bushfire season. The fires continue to claim lives, with many more losses of life feared in coming days. Social Media

From Beach Holiday To Beach Hell

Beaches are the epitome of the Australian summer. Now they have become a scene of desperation and panic as thousands are evacuated from usual cheery summer holiday spots and told to run for their lives ... to the beach.

The sight of some 4,000 people seeking safety on Mallacoota beach in the southeastern state of Victoria on New Years Eve, under a sky turned menacingly blood red and hellish black shades, struck at the heart of the nation. The same “red hell” scenario may be repeated tenfold over coming days, weeks, months …

As the flames closed in on the small East Gippsland town, people were handed out life jackets and told to 'get in the water'.

The Australian coast–the symbolic lifeline of our connection to the world–has become a lifeline full stop. This is when we know collectively we are in deep water. Clinging to the coast for dear life.

Antipodean Apocalypse For Dawn Of New Decade

The emergency warnings from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) over the past days read like a litany of horrors, as an Australian Armageddon rings in a new decade.

""You could be impacted anytime within the next 30 minutes. Leaving now is the safest option, before conditions become too dangerous. Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay.""

And the worst most heartbreaking alert, echoing in our ears after two months of hellfire: “It is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches.”

There is nothing that can quite make you feel so personally in danger, than when the usually heavenly Aussie beach turns into Hades. Thousands “trapped on the beach” read the headlines. The usual place of freedom and carefree summers turned into a human trap.

Climate Change Denial: Government Fiddles As Australia Burns

Where does this end? Just to what extent does one have to fear for one’s life as an Australian, or an overseas holidaymaker?

As 1000 firefighters defended the East Gippsland region, temperatures across the country hit highs of 39C-41C (105-109F)–after record national averages of 40.9C (105.6F) in December.

While the government continues to deny the well-established climate change driven fire hazards, the future's looking grim for a happy start to the New Year in Australia.

Australia is burning. Blazing furnace and furious. The skies are eternally menacing, and the environmental message hard to escape. In a scathing article, Man Booker Prize winning Tasmanian author Richard Flanagan compared Prime Minister, Scott Morrison to Nero (accused of playing the fiddle as Rome burned in 64 AD), for jumping ship during the fires; as much as for his ignorance on climate change, which has become the shame of the nation.

A Sydney mural by artist Scott Marsh depicting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on holiday ... [+] in Hawaii. 'ScoMo' has been slammed for abandoning the nation to take a tropical island vacation mid-crisis. The PM returned to Australia from a family holiday on Saturday 21 December, following intense criticism for taking leave while bushfires burned nationwide. Emergency-level fires have been sweeping across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia over the past week, and are even threatening suburban Sydney and Melbourne on New Year's Eve. Several lives have been claimed, both volunteer firefighters and civilians in the past week, bringing the total to 12 deaths linked to the nation's bushfire crisis. (Photo by Cole Bennetts/Getty Images) Getty Images

To ScoMo’s continual “We live in the best country in the world” gloating, Flanagan replied:

“Actually, out of 57 countries recently rated on climate change action Australia is ranked 57th. Which is not best. Which is last. Which gives us the claim to be the worst country in the world on the most important problem facing mankind. Thanks Nero.”

Scared Nation … What Does The Future Hold?

Fear not hope reigned in Australia on New Years Day, and continues to. And it, along with the eddying flames, is spreading like wildfire, engulfing the country in a thick haze of nebulous doubt for the future.

‘If miraculously we survive this season of fires, what about the next?’ is the question many are asking in dread.

There are only so many times such unbridled fury of nature can show mercy. As it is, some experts feel the extreme heat, drought and bushfires, have already turned the country into a “Hell on Earth”."," Threaten, not specified below",3

WHILE THE Uttar Pradesh government has issued notices for recovery of damages for destruction of public property during protests against the amended citizenship law, the question of whether Dera Sacha Sauda can be made to pay for damage to property worth Rs 118 crore in Haryana after Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim’s conviction in a rape case in 2017, is still pending in the absence of a legislation on recovery, and because of a pending court case.

There was large-scale violence in Haryana, particularly Panchkula, after Ram Rahim was convicted in a rape case. In the run-up to the verdict by a special CBI court at Panchkula, hundreds of Dera followers had gathered outside the court complex. As the verdict was pronounced, there was mass violence and destruction to property worth Rs 118 crore as per official estimates. At least 36 people were killed in Haryana in forces’ action.

Since August 2017, Dera property across Punjab and Haryana has remained frozen — sale, transfer, alienation or encumbrance of the properties stayed — on orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The legal question of whether damages can be recovered from Dera is pending, was framed by the court in a suo motu case in 2017. In December 2019, a full bench of the HC had fast-tracked the hearing over pending questions of law regarding recovery. The hearings are likely to conclude in the second week of January.

On December 10, the arguments finally began for the first time since 2017 and continued on December 13 and 18. The hearings will resume on January 8. So far, only the amicus curiae has made arguments in the case and the court for the next hearing has asked him to assist it regarding the law for regulating mass gatherings. The court on previous dates has also said it will examine the Haryana government’s role in allowing Dera followers to gather in Panchkula in the run-up to the verdict against the Dera chief.

The Haryana government is yet to make arguments in the case, though it has submitted estimates of damage caused to public and private property. On September 27, 2017, the HC had directed the state to establish a tribunal to look into the claims of damage to properties received from various claimants, but the same has not been done yet due to pendency of the question over liability behind the violence.

The Rs 118 crore figure includes damages to public and private property besides the revenue loss and expenses for providing services including security and stay of paramilitary forces in the state. Punjab had during recent hearings of the case also has raised a claim regarding payment made by it to the Centre for deployment of central forces during the Dera violence. Dera’s counsels in preliminary submissions have contended that liability has to be established on the basis of evidence of whether the Dera management directly asked the followers to cause violence.

What does the law say?

At present, there is no central legislation governing the recovery of damages except for the Supreme Court-issued guidelines of 2009, which the Centre has instructed all state governments to implement in letter and spirit. In October 2018, the Supreme Court had further gone ahead and laid down a procedure for recovery of damages as it hoped that a Bill, regarding the recovery of damages pending since 2015, will be taken to its “logical end in the right earnest”. The law concerning the property damage is Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act (PDPP Act), 1984, but at present, it only has provisions for imprisonment and fine.

The 2015 bill, in addition to the existing law for imprisonment and fine, proposed a fine by court equivalent to the market value of the public property damaged and also establishing guilt of office-bearers of the organisation which calls for a protest leading to destruction of property. The bill never made it to Parliament but the Union government had in October 2018 suggested measures and itself asked for interim directions from the Supreme Court. It said the bill is still under consideration.

In 2007, the Supreme Court had taken suo motu cognizance of issues related to damage to properties during protests. The bench appointed two committees to look into the matter. The Justice Thomas Committee recommended an amendment to the PDPP Act to hold leaders of the agitating group guilty of abetment. The Nariman committee asked the apex court to “evolve a principle of liability, punitive in nature, on account of vandalism and rioting leading to damage/destruction of property”. The liability should lie with “the actual perpetrators of the crime as well as organisers of the event giving rise to the liability – to be shared as finally determined by the High Court or Supreme Court as the case may be”, the Nariman committee had said.

The recommendations, which were immediately ordered to be made operative, also said liability will be borne by the actual perpetrator as well as the organisers. In each case, the HC is authorised to initiate suo motu action to investigate mass destruction of property and has to appoint a sitting or retired HC judge or a sitting or retired district judge as a claims commissioner to estimate the damages and investigate the liability. The guidelines are operative in absence of a law regarding recovery of damages.

In October 2018, the Supreme Court in the Kodungallur Film Society’s case further ordered that, “a person arrested for either committing or initiating, promoting, instigating or in any way causing to occur any act of violence which results in loss of life or damage to property may be granted conditional bail upon depositing the quantified loss caused due to such violence or furnishing security for such quantified loss”. If the loss is yet to be quantified, the apex court said, the judge hearing the bail application may quantify the amount of tentative damages which will remain subject to final determination by the appropriate authority”.

While the Supreme Court has entrusted the responsibility on high courts and even lower judiciary during bail hearings in its 2009 and 2018 directions, the UP government has issued notices on the basis of an Allahabad High Court ruling of 2010, which states that a competent authority appointed by the government has to decide the claims for compensation and pass order against whom the claim has been filed; the order has to passed after hearing the parties.

The court guidelines are applicable only in the absence of law. Punjab had in 2017 amended its PDPP Act and notified that anyone found guilty of damaging act shall be also liable to make a payment of an amount equivalent to the loss caused to the public or private property as decided by the competent authority. In the erstwhile state of J&K, a proposed amendment to The Jammu and Kashmir PDPP Act was referred to a select committee of the then Assembly on February 10, 2018, following opposition protests against its “draconian” provisions.

1928,12e4f3f7af27243fdb5db27e180c555d,"SALT LAKE CITY — A Draper man is accused of sexually assaulting a woman he had encouraged to do a photo shoot.

David Kaleokalani Griffin, 44, was charged Tuesday in 3rd District Court with rape, a first-degree felony; and forcible sexual abuse, a second-degree felony.

The woman, whose age was not given in court documents, told police that Griffin approached her and asked if she had ever considered modeling, according to charging documents. Griffin gave the woman his business card and offered to do a photo shoot in his studio.

In June, the woman agreed to meet Griffin at his Draper studio, the charges state.

But “throughout the photo shoot, (the woman) stated that Griffin convinced her that showing more skin was better to make her portfolio more marketable,” the charges state.

Griffin had the woman change outfits several times, showing more skin with each outfit, according to charging documents. He would also move her into position for the camera.

“(The woman) stated that she became more and more uncomfortable with the way Griffin was touching her body as he rearranged her for the photograph,” the charges state.

The woman told police, however, that “she had no experience with modeling and thought Griffin was a professional.”

When Griffin was rubbing lotion on the woman, allegedly to make her skin look “shiny” for the photograph, he raped her, the charges state.

The woman, who said she froze, asked Griffin for another outfit after he was done assaulting her, and then ran out of the studio when he walked away to get it, according to the charges.

When interviewed by police, Griffin said he “felt like she wanted to take things further,” the charges state.

Her short temper (she was accused of assault several times), involvement in inciting violence, love for expensive clothes and jewellery, and high political ambitions meant she was reviled by many Zimbabweans.

Last week, Zimbabweans issued a warning the country’s new first lady, Auxilia Mnangagwa: stay away from the president’s office.

Will she heed the call and who is she really?

Here are five things to know about Auxilia Mnangagwa:

1. Wife number two or three?

There are conflicting reports about whether she is President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s second or third wife. During his inauguration speech, the president acknowledged their marriage of 31 years. However, reports state she only emerged as his spouse after his first wife died of cancer in 2000.

2. Work in government

Auxilia Mnangagwa has extensive experience working for the Zimbabwean government. After finishing secretarial studies, she joined the Ministry of Manpower and Development in 1981. She joined the Prime Minister’s office in 1992 and also worked in Zanu-PF’s finance department.

3. She was a spy

The first lady worked at the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) between 1992 and 1997. There have been some unconfirmed reports that she was deployed by Robert Mugabe to monitor her husband’s movements.

4. She has her own political ambitions

Auxilia Mnangagwa submitted her name to represent Zanu-PF in Mazowe Central where she was born, but her submission was declined. However, she was elected an MP in 2015.

5. She’s a philanthropist

The first lady&39;s charitable work has a focus on the upliftment of women. She helped establish women’s banks in several areas of the country’s Midlands."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Prince William has warned that Earth is at a ""tipping point"" as he launched an environmental scheme in a bid to save the planet.

The Duke of Cambridge, 37, announced he was setting up the Earthshot Prize with help from broadcaster and natural historian Sir David Attenborough, 93.

Throughout the next decade, the Earth shot prize will donate 50 multimillion-pound awards to scientists who come up with innovative methods of battling climate change.

Prince William called for ten years of action to ""repair the Earth"", warning that failing to do so would result in catastrophic consequences.

""The next 10 years present us with one of our greatest tests - a decade of action to repair Earth,"" the Duke said.

Second, in line of succession to the British throne, William has launched what could become the most prestigious environmental award in history, Daily Mirror reports.

By incentivising scientists to find new ways of averting a climate disaster, the prince hopes the prize will be a powerful vehicle for change in a world that is becoming dangerously overheated.

By Ahmed Rasheed and Idrees Ali

BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Protesters angry about U.S. air strikes on Iraq hurled stones and torched a security post at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, setting off a confrontation with guards and prompting the United States to send additional troops to the Middle East.

The protests, led by Iranian-backed militias, posed a new foreign policy challenge for U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces re-election in 2020. He threatened to retaliate against Iran.

The State Department said diplomatic personnel inside were safe and there were no plans to evacuate them.

Embassy guards used stun grenades and tear gas to repel protesters, who stormed and burned the security post at the entrance but did not breach the main compound.

The Pentagon said that in addition to Marines sent to protect embassy personnel, about 750 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were being sent to the Middle East and that additional troops were prepared to deploy over the next several days.

""This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a statement.

U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 750 troops would initially be based out of Kuwait. The officials said that as many as 4,000 troops could be sent to the region in the coming days if needed.

More than 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq supporting local forces.

The unprecedented attack on an American diplomatic mission in Iraq marked a sharp escalation of the proxy conflict between the United States and Iran - both influential players in the country - and plunged U.S. relations with Iraq to their worst level in years.

The United States and its allies invaded Iraq in 2003 and ousted Saddam Hussein. But political stability has been elusive.

Trump, on a two-week working vacation in Palm Beach, Florida, spoke by phone to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq. ""President Trump emphasized the need to protect United States personnel and facilities in Iraq,"" the White House said.

Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the violence.

""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,"" Trump said in a tweet.

Iran, under severe economic duress from punishing U.S. sanctions put in place by Trump, denied responsibility.

""America has the surprising audacity of attributing to Iran the protests of the Iraqi people against (Washington's) savage killing of at least 25 Iraqis,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said.

The embassy incident came seven years after the 2012 attack by armed militants on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the death of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans and led to multiple congressional investigations.

TENSIONS OVER AIR STRIKES

The protests followed U.S. air strikes on Sunday on bases operated by the Iranian-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah inside Iraq, which killed at least 25 fighters and wounded 55. The strikes were retaliation for the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, which Washington blamed on Kataib Hezbollah.

""Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.""

Democrats upset that Trump ditched the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2015 were quick to pounce on the incident as a failure of Trump's Iran policy.

""The predictable result of the Trump administration's reckless bluster, escalation and miscalculation in the Middle East is that we are now hurtling closer to an unauthorized war with Iran that the American people do not support,"" said U.S. Senator Tom Udall, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

The protesters, joined briefly by Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim militia leaders, threw stones at the embassy gate, while others chanted: ""No, no, America! No, no, Trump!""

Iraqi special forces prevented protesters entering, later reinforced by U.S.-trained Iraqi Counter Terrorism forces.

The embassy has been hit by sporadic but non-lethal rocket fire in recent months, and was regularly shelled following the U.S.-led invasion of 2003, but had not been physically attacked by demonstrators in that way before.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS News that U.S. officials never contemplated evacuating the embassy and had kept the heat on Iraqi officials to ensure the compound was safe.

""We reminded them throughout the day of their continued responsibility,"" he said.

The Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella grouping of the militias that have been officially integrated into Iraq's armed forces, said 62 militiamen and civilians were wounded by the tear gas and stun grenades fired to disperse the crowd.

A Reuters witness saw blood on the face of one wounded militiaman and on the stomach of the other as their colleagues carried them away.

Iraqis have been taking to the streets in the thousands almost daily to condemn, among other things, militias such as Kataib Hezbollah and their Iranian patrons that support Abdul Mahdi's government.

Kataib Hezbollah is one of the smallest but most potent of the Iranian-backed militias. Its flags were hung on the fence surrounding the embassy.

14-Day Risk Free Trial: Get full access to this and all Fintech industry research reports.

Open banking has arrived, and it's transforming the UK's banking landscape - next up could be the world. Regulatory efforts in the UK are transforming retail banking, reshaping incumbents' relationships with customers, and easing entry for fintechs.

Regulators across every continent are responding with actions of their own. Underpinning open banking initiatives is the idea that ownership of transactional data belongs to consumers instead of incumbent financial institutions.

The implications of this change for established lenders in the UK are significant. For those that act, open banking presents substantial revenue-generating opportunities.

But the consequences of inaction are even more severe: Business Insider Intelligence estimates that by 2024, £6.5 billion ($8.4 billion) of UK incumbents' revenues will be under threat of being scooped up by forward-thinking companies like fintechs and neobanks. Yet even through the financial incentives to act are clear, many incumbents are struggling to determine the best path to monetization. In fact, some aren't even sure what their options are.

In The Monetization of Open Banking report, Business Insider Intelligence identifies monetization strategies incumbents have at their disposal, describes how they can determine the best approach for their specific needs, and outlines actionable steps they need to make their chosen open banking initiative successful.

The companies mentioned in this report are: Allied Irish Bank (AIB), Bank of Ireland, Barclays, Danske Bank, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS Group, and Santander, Monzo, Starling, ING, Yolt, Fidor, BBVA

Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:

Driven by regulatory action, open banking is transforming the UK's banking landscape, but it's also gaining momentum globally.

For incumbents, open banking entails a significant threat to their entrenched position.

But for forward-looking banks, there are substantial opportunities for revenue generation, both directly and indirectly.

To seize these opportunities - and avoid losing revenue to fintechs and neobanks - it's critical that legacy players focus their efforts in the right direction, including identifying their strategic priorities.

2101,b274d09cdc34624ed05d4de178191067,"Trump threatens Iran after protesters attack US embassy in Baghdad

By Arwa Damon, Jeremy Diamond, Pamela Brown and Ryan Browne, CNN

(CNN) -- President Donald Trump threatened Iran Tuesday, warning the country's leaders they will be held responsible for any death or destruction after protesters attacked the US embassy in Baghdad.

""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,"" Trump tweeted from Florida. ""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.""

Protesters attacked the US Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, scaling the walls and forcing the gates of the compound, as hundreds demonstrated against American airstrikes on an Iran-backed militia group in Iraq.

As night fell, protesters set up tents near the embassy, suggesting another day of upheaval lies ahead. Iraqi counter terrorism forces were deployed around the perimeter of the embassy, while the Pentagon announced additional Marines would be sent to Baghdad and more troops would be deployed to the Middle East in response to the embassy crisis.





'It's going to be tense'





Trump stressed safety in a set of tweets and drew a direct comparison to the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead, even as a senior administration official told CNN the White House is ""very concerned"" about the potential for further escalation come New Year's Day morning.

""Tomorrow, during the daytime, it's going to be tense,"" the official said.

Another senior administration official said the administration is ""not going to assume it's an escalation, but also is not going to be unaware"" of the potential for further deterioration with Iran, adding that ""it's a complicated situation.""

The administration hopes everything will calm down and go back to normal, the official said, but is prepared for all contingencies and is keeping a close eye on the situation.

This official added that Trump emphasized in a call with the Iraqi prime minister that Iraq has a responsibility to protect the US embassy and personnel.

For now, US officials are closely watching the situation and hopeful that a bolstered Iraqi response and US moves to reinforce security will be enough. Trump insisted in a Tuesday tweet that the embassy was safe.

""The U.S. Embassy in Iraq is, & has been for hours, SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters, together with the most lethal military equipment in the world, was immediately rushed to the site,"" Trump tweeted. ""The Anti-Benghazi!"" he added in a separate post.

The US military is expected to soon deploy additional military forces to the Middle East in response to the situation, a US defense official told CNN, on top of about 100 additional Marines from a crisis response task force based in Kuwait that arrived in Baghdad today to bolster embassy security.

The number of troops could be as large as ""a brigade type element"" or a few thousand additional US soldiers drawn mostly from the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, according to the official, who said they could arrive in a matter of days at the earliest.

The attacks on the embassy are a response to US airstrikes on Sunday gainst an Iran-backed militia that formally sits under the control of Iraq's prime minister. The airstrikes have caused tension with Baghdad, where officials accused the US of attacking without sufficient evidence, violating Iraqi sovereignty and threatening the country's security.





Iran pushes back





While Trump, US officials and lawmakers placed blame for the protests squarely on Iran, a foreign ministry spokesman in Tehran vehemently denied the allegations.

In a Tuesday statement, Abbas Mousavi called the US allegation ""obscenity"" while ""Iraqi people are overwhelmed with bloodshed [in which] at least 25 people died,"" a reference to the death toll of US airstrikes on the militia, Kataib Hezbollah, in Iraq on Sunday.

""How and on what basis do you expect the Iraqi people to remain silent on all these crimes?"" Mousavi said, adding that the United States has ""ignored"" Iraqi independence and called on Washington to ""reconsider its destructive policies in the region.""

Both the White House and militia representatives signaled Tuesday that the situation could escalate, while US officials stressed their readiness to protect American personnel, flying Apache helicopters over the embassy in a show of force and announcing the military reinforcements.

White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham cast the protests as an Iranian ""escalation,"" saying that ""it will be the President's choice how and when we respond.""

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Iran-backed militia, Kataib Hezbollah, told CNN that the embassy protests were only a ""first step.""

""The American administration should understand the following: the first step was to protest near the American embassy, we are waiting their reactions to determine the second step,"" Mohamad Mouhiye said, calling for the US to shut down the embassy and withdraw from Iraq.

""First, close the doors of the evil embassy, which we consider a spy building and an operations room to administer and sabotage Iraq's wellbeing,"" Mouhiye said. ""We also call on the US to withdraw their military forces which are in Iraq illegally,"" he said.

""This protest was a stand against US political dominance,"" he said.





No evacuation plans





The embassy, in Baghdad's green zone, has been put under lockdown, an embassy spokesperson told CNN, but a State Department spokesperson insisted ""there has been no breach."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News Tuesday evening that there are currently no plans to evacuate the embassy or pull out US troops.

US ambassador to Iraq Matthew Tueller has been on vacation for more than a week, but a State Department spokesperson said Tueller is returning to the embassy.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Pentagon is working closely with the State Department to ensure the safety of the embassy and staff in Baghdad. He also reminded Iraq of its obligations under international law.

""We have taken appropriate force protection actions to ensure the safety of American citizens, military personnel and diplomats in country, and to ensure our right of self-defense,"" Esper said. ""As in all countries, we rely on host nation forces to assist in the protection of our personnel in country, and we call on the Government of Iraq to fulfill its international responsibilities to do so.""

It is not clear how many people are inside the embassy, but it is the US' largest diplomatic mission in the world, with around 16,000 staff. The compound covers around 100 acres, around the same size as the Vatican City.

The pro-Iranian demonstrators were mostly from Iraq's Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), a coalition of predominantly Shiite militias. Formed in 2014 to fight ISIS, the PMU were recognized under a 2016 Iraqi law as an independent military force that answers directly to the prime minister.

Despite the Iraqi law, most observers see many of those groups, including Kataib Hezbollah, as maintaining strong links to Iran and its security forces, from which they receive funding and other support, as well as some direction.

Three leaders of powerful militia groups were also seen at the protest, including Kataib Hezbollah leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

The US carried out five airstrikes in Iraq and Syria on Sunday on facilities controlled by Kataib Hezbollah, killing at least 25 people and wounding 51, in the first significant US military response to weeks of deadly rocket attacks by the Iran-backed group on US-Iraqi targets.

US officials said the strikes were carried out with F-15 Strike Eagle fighter planes and targeted weapons storage facilities and command and control locations used by Kataib Hezbollah. The Pentagon said the locations had been used ""to plan and execute attacks"" on joint US-Iraq forces.

The strikes and ensuing protests come at a time of high tensions between the US and Iran, and have stoked fears of a new proxy war in the Middle East.

Washington has tightened the economic squeeze on Tehran this year through its ""maximum pressure"" campaign, while Iran has responded with what it calls for ""maximum resistance,"" including reducing its compliance to the international nuclear deal.

The Trump administration pulled the US out of that deal in May 2018, sparking a campaign of provocation between the two nations that has included attacks by Iran or its proxies on US allies and oil infrastructure and shipping.





Trump blames Iran





Trump confirmed Tuesday that Sunday's airstrikes were a response to a recent attack that killed a US contractor. He blamed Iran both for the contractor's death and Tuesday's attack on the embassy.

""Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!"" Trump tweeted.

The airstrikes and embassy attackhave created new tensions between allies Washington and Baghdad and come at a time of unrest, as mass protests across Iraq challenge the nation's government.

Baghdad warned Monday that its relations with the US were at risk following the strikes. Questions have also been raised as to whether Iraqi forces allowed the protesters to reach the US Embassy, a highly fortified building in an area that is usually restricted.

Pompeo spoke with Iraq's embattled Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi and President Barham Salih on Tuesday, the State Department said in a statement.

""The Secretary made clear the United States will protect and defend its people, who are there to support a sovereign and independent Iraq. Both Abdul-Mahdi and Salih assured the Secretary that they took seriously their responsibility for and would guarantee the safety and security of US personnel and property,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.

Abdul-Mahdi earlier called on protesters to leave the area around the embassy, warning them against acts of aggression.

""We ask everyone to immediately leave these places, and we recall that any aggression or harassment of foreign embassies and representations are an act that will be strictly prohibited by the security forces and will be punished by law with the most severe penalties,"" Abdul Mahdi said in a statement.

But he also described those killed in the US airstrikes as ""martyrs"" and supported a funeral for them in the capital's streets.

So, one of my New Year resolutions for 2019 was to sign up for a mobile phone app that automatically squirrels away spare change. I chose Moneybox, which rounds up my spending to the nearest £1 and moves it into a stocks and shares Isa.

After 12 months, I was thrilled to discover that my pot is now worth almost £500 and currently earning around a 4 per cent return.

It’s not a life-changing sum of money, but what’s so brilliant is that, with only small amounts leaving my account each week, I barely even noticed it had gone.

And if I can save another £500 each year for the next decade like this, I’ll have built up a pot worth £5,000 — before any interest is even added — with zero effort.

If you have set yourself a money-making New Year resolution for 2020, or cashed in as a result of a goal you made at the beginning of 2019, write to me at the email address below, or Money Mail, 2 Derry Street, London, W8 5TT. I’ll print the best letters in my column next week.

For now, on behalf of the whole team at Money Mail, we wish you a very Happy New Year.

The government of Cyprus has said it has ""full confidence in the justice system and the courts"" after a British teenager was found guilty of lying about being gang-raped.

Britain's Foreign Office said the UK was ""seriously concerned"" about the fairness of the 19-year-old woman's trial and it is understood officials have raised the ""deeply distressing case"" with the Cypriot authorities.

Lawyers and campaigners criticised the justice system after she was convicted of public mischief at Famagusta District Court, in Paralimni, on Monday.

But a Cypriot government spokesman said: ""The Republic of Cyprus as an orderly state has constitutionally established institutions and separation of powers.

""In this context, the government does not intervene in cases brought before the competent courts of the Republic of Cyprus, nor does it comment on positions or allegations which are raised with respect to cases still pending before the courts.

""The government has full confidence in the justice system and the courts of the Republic of Cyprus, which should be left unfettered to implement state laws and deliver justice.""

The teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in the party town of Ayia Napa on July 17.

But she was charged and the dozen young men, aged between 15 and 20, who were arrested over the incident, were freed after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later.

She said she was forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police. She could face up to a year in jail and a €1,700 fine when she is sentenced on January 7.

2306,32a2aa0a56f4f7db67f0e79b6aaf3f67,"IN 2018, the American restaurant review officially entered its midlife crisis. A literary baby boomer, the modern review was born in 1957 when Craig Claiborne became editor of the New York Times Food Page (changing its name from the “Women’s Section”), inaugurating weekly columns, a four-star rating system, and a code of professional guidelines. Throughout the ’60s and ’70s, the rebellious teenage genre staked out a public reputation on the fire-breathing prose of Gael Greene and Mimi Sheraton. Over the ’90s, the review eased into middle age as a pillar of respectable bourgeois journalism. But in the new millennium, the dawn of foodie subculture added an element of hero worship to the profession’s public image. For the informed eater, Jonathan Gold and Ruth Reichl were less journalists than Associate Justices on the Culinary Supreme Court. However, settling into its seventh decade, the silver-haired restaurant review has stumbled into a tumultuous cultural climate — and its old-fashioned views are starting to wear thin.

2018 was a year of tectonic shifts in restaurant writing. Both the critic and the criteria came under scrutiny. The #MeToo scandals sparked a national reexamination of the field’s food-first values. Media outlets across the country debated how to cover restaurants owned by Mario Batali, John Besh, Paul Qui, and other alleged abusers. Eater: “Maybe Don’t Review Restaurants Run by Bad People?” Philadelphia Inquirer: “It’s Not My Job to Pass Judgment on a Chef’s Character.” In the middle of this headline battle, across an eight-day span in July, revered Los Angeles Times critic Jonathan Gold died and San Francisco Chronicle critic Michael Bauer announced his retirement. These events triggered a full-on succession crisis in West Coast criticism.

Fast forward five months, and three young female critics of color had started new positions at major newspapers: Patricia Escárcega succeeded Gold at the Los Angeles Times, Soleil Ho joined the Chronicle, and Tejal Rao became the first-ever California Restaurant Critic at The New York Times — prompting a wave of “next generation” headlines before they’d even published a word. The sheer pace of change was staggering. On April 1, 2018, Michael Bauer wrote in the Chronicle, “As a human, I condemn harassment [but] when I wear my critic’s hat, I’m not evaluating what happens behind the kitchen door.” Three hundred and thirty-eight days later, Soleil Ho inaugurated her Chronicle tenure by announcing she would not cover compromised chefs in an editorial touting “ethical eating in the age of #MeToo.” In less than a year, the restaurant review had left the Country Club and embraced Cancel Culture.

This critical triumvirate is leading a literary reformation of the field. Building on the pioneering model of Jonathan Gold, they promise to tackle greater civic and social questions than the cooking on the plate. The old ideal of critic as neutral arbiter gives way to a modern vision of the critic as hip, multicultural storyteller. “I don’t see the critic’s task as one of simply deciding if a food or restaurant experience is pleasing,” writes Soleil Ho, “but rather using an aesthetic evaluation of restaurants to tell stories about the connections between people, cultures, and communities.”

Ho’s credo reflects a larger generational revolt against the review’s traditional mission. With the popularity of guides like Michelin and Zagat and the ubiquity of online review sites like Yelp, the profession no longer needs to fill the consumer need of telling people where to eat. In response, younger critics want to explore how we live, not just how we dine. “[W]e think of restaurant criticism as cultural criticism,” writes Eater’s editor-in-chief Amanda Kludt, “a review shouldn’t just tell a reader whether to order the omu rice or the penne a la vodka [but] what financial, artistic, or societal forces are pushing [each restaurant] to be a certain way.” Paolo Lucchesi, senior editor at the Chronicle, envisions the review page as “the story of the Bay Area told through restaurants.” Patricia Escárcega holds that “the food critic is an interpreter of culture,” while Tim Carman believes the field must “look at broader societal issues” in “the era of #MeToo, social justice, and crowdsourced restaurant reviews.”

Transforming the review into a mouthpiece for progressive politics is the opinion à la mode in food media. “Using food to talk about systems,” Ho argues, “is a way to get people to start thinking about these things that’s a little gentler than a straight political editorial.” “When we talk about restaurant criticism,” contends Korsha Wilson, host of the podcast A Hungry Society, “we need to look at the fact that dining is impacted” by the “same systems of oppression that work in every other part of the country.” In a striking choice of words, the Chronicle announced that they hired Ho as their new restaurant critic to “confront questions of ethics and social justice.”

Yet the particulars of the “woke” restaurant review remain hazy. After all, the social justice implications of dining out are dense and overdetermined. The average reviewer, in 700 words, cannot even begin to address how a restaurant’s food is grown and prepared, how its staff is treated and compensated, how the chef and cuisine found funding, and what kind of customer can afford to visit. I just want to deal with one of the genre’s challenges — namely, its form. For, the #MeToo scandals exposed not just the critic’s impoverished ethics but impoverished imagination — and it is the misunderstood connection between these two that I want to impress on you.

Strange as it sounds, I believe the restaurant critic’s moral quietism derives from literary shortcomings as much as ethical ones. To be blunt, the traditional review is a terrible vessel for inventive prose, contrarian opinions, and nuanced arguments about the mystery and meaning of food. It is a journalistic luxury liner, designed to exalt lavish spending and indulgent dining, which makes attempting to retool it into a vehicle of scrappy political protest a paradoxical endeavor — like trying to retrofit a stretch limousine into a fire engine. No matter who’s driving, there is some terrain a limo will never reach.

So what’s wrong with the restaurant review? In short, it’s been telling the same story about food all its life.

The Classic Restaurant Review has a depressingly predictable template. Almost every column follows the same formula: a chronological procession of dishes from appetizer to entree to dessert (with detours on decor and drinks) culminating in an overall “verdict.” In this way, literary structure mimics meal structure. It is startling how many articles simply reproduce the order of the menu in the text. For instance, the Washington Post’s Tom Sietsema started four out of his final eight reviews in 2018 by mentioning an appetizer in the first sentence. In Lesley Chesterman’s 2018 list of best new Montreal restaurants, 10 out of 10 reviews began on hors d’oeuvres and ended on dessert. In column after column, reviewers shrink their thoughts and experiences to fit the prix-fixe plot. But by defaulting to this template, critics encage their own imagination — like an artist who only works on paint-by-number worksheets and never graduates to a blank canvas.

This menu-tour style of narrative springs directly from the review’s bourgeois roots. “The origins of modern restaurant criticism,” explains Korsha Wilson, trace back to “tell[ing] upper and middle class, implicitly white New Yorkers where to spend their money on their next night out.” Product placement is baked into the plot line as most of the genre’s literary conventions (from the lavish diction to the four-star-rating system to the fixation on wine lists) were chosen for their ability to drive consumer decisions not stimulate ideas. But after 50 years, the gourmet tale that Craig Claiborne dreamed up for Eisenhower’s America no longer does justice to the myriad meanings critics seek on their plates.

Healthy art forms naturally evolve to accommodate new attitudes and influences. Modernist painting emerged in Europe in response to the invention of photography. Pop songs fluctuated in length over the decades to match the distribution needs of radio, albums, iTunes, and Spotify. Horror movies updated their bogeymen from haunted houses to haunted iPhones for the Facebook era. And we’ve seen inklings of this sort of formal innovation in restaurant criticism. Occasionally, for high-profile pans, critics deviate from the standard plot and devise a unique format to hone their disapproval. For example, Pete Wells wrote his famous takedown of Guy Fieri as a series of rhetorical questions and framed his critique of the hyper-expensive Kappo Masa as a call-and-response price list (“Price for bland watery cauliflower florets: $28 […] Stars I am giving it: zero”). To tackle gentrification, Victoria Bouloubasis invited a local Mexican family to review the Lakewood kitchen driving up rents in their zip code.

There’s a lesson here: the responsible critic’s first step in confronting a difficult topic is finding a fresh format. Approaching gentrification with the same editorial tools you use to describe gazpacho is about as futile as trying to fix a power outage with a plunger. To address important cultural changes, food writers need literary formats as nimble and contemporary as the issues they seek to interrogate.

Writing by template has moral consequences — there’s no good place for a writer to mention rape allegations in the appetizer-to-dessert story line. Watching respected critics attempt to twist ordinary reviews to grapple with #MeToo accusations became a queasy spectacle over the past two years. “Ordinarily, I might check into a significant new restaurant a month-and-a-half to two months into its life,” writes Alison Cook, justifying why she reviewed a venture owned by a chef arrested for assaulting his girlfriend. “Yet I didn’t visit Aqui until December 8, nearly four months after it opened, most likely (I believe in retrospect) because I was trying to put off the inevitable moment of moral reckoning.” But the reckoning arrives a few lines later. “I don’t feel qualified to tell anyone else whether they should patronize Aqui. I can only explain why staying away ultimately didn’t feel right to me.” Cook finds herself in a curious predicament: her moral does not match her story. No matter how hard she strains, Cook will never bend the stiff dinner-brochure format into a narrative capable of dissecting an issue like domestic violence. The moral demands a different story.

How can restaurant criticism discover such a story? What is needed, first and foremost, is a shift in mindset, an existential about-face from recommending places for dinner to investigating how society finds meaning through food. Some day, I hope to read gastronomic reviews as incisive, layered, and absorbing as critical discussions of books and music — and I am not alone. The cultural conditions are ripe for this type of reinvention. Food continues to rise as the most relevant cultural medium for many millennials. People are raising new questions about the implications of their eating, and a host of media platforms are experimenting with original ways to explore food from unusual angles. In their first year on the job, Ho, Escárcega, and Rao have overturned historical norms such as star ratings and critical anonymity, and pushed the profession toward pluralism and risk-taking. Cleared of its traditional trappings, food criticism has set the stage for a new act to begin. But to complete the restaurant reviewer’s jump from concierge to culture critic, a few core assumptions about the genre must be revised.

In that spirit, I want to depart from the tradition of ending a negative column on a snappy, drop-the-mic insult, and instead to conclude by sketching out five modest proposals to help guide the 63-year-old restaurant review into 21st-century relevance.

1. Redefine the question

The field’s core question should be revised from “Would I recommend this spot to an upper-middle-class diner?” to “Why does this dining experience matter?” In each piece, a conscientious critic should ask, “What does this meal say about our city, our culture, and our people?” It’s a leap from addressing the consumer to addressing the citizen.

2. Reimagine the setting

The review must escape the dining room. Search for unexpected settings such as schools, jails, homeless shelters, wedding banquets, military bases, monasteries, corporate cafeterias, or convents (Catholic or Buddhist) — any location whose meals resonate with societal significance. For instance, a critic who wants to spotlight urban poverty could “review a neighborhood” by evaluating the dining options in a three-block radius for an affluent part of Noe Valley versus a food desert in West Oakland. By expanding the field of acceptable topics, the review can evolve from judging what’s on the plate to investigating the forces that shape what’s not on the menu.

3. Experiment with format

The average restaurant review displays about as much formal creativity as a DMV application. This is a shame. Critics should try different formats as often as they try different cuisines. Imaginative formats lead to lively, energetic writing. There are so many possible models to try: a shopping list, a soliloquy, a parable, a job posting, a day-in-the-life, an obituary, and much more. Even minor innovations like using rhetorical questions or writing in the second person can unleash wellsprings of entertaining prose and insight. Consider Ruth Reichl’s iconic dual review of Le Cirque that skewered the preferential treatment of high-end customers by dividing the column between “Dinner as a Most Favored Patron” and “Dinner as the Unknown Diner.” Like switching from a magnifying glass to a microscope, choosing a fresh format brings a universe of new topics into the review’s domain. [1]

4. Dialogue over monologue

Classic restaurant criticism can feel like an editorial dictatorship: a few anointed reviewers rain down verdicts on which kitchens should thrive and which should shutter. I have a remedy: why not present reviews as dramatic dialogues between multiple people rather than one person’s autocratic opinion? Dining out, after all, is an inherently communal activity. It might be more interesting — and more realistic — to frame the review as a Socratic dialogue between the critic and a specially chosen guest (ideally someone outside a restaurant’s normal clientele). Eating with a truck driver at Saison will tell you things about tasting menus that Bon Appétit never could. Adding a second voice with a worldview and tone drastically different from those of the urbanite critic unlocks countless possibilities. Most harmonies and discords only surface with multiple voices.

5. Shake up the speaker

Big-city gourmets are not the only people qualified to be food writers. It’s time to break up the white-male monopoly on the genre by inviting overlooked perspectives to join the Review Page. This type of diversity includes gender and race but also encompasses region, discipline, ideals, and voice. Commission a Creole poet to eulogize their favorite gumbo. Send a naturalist to inspect a “sustainably” sourced salad. Ask a suburban Republican to review that All-American steakhouse. Pairing authors with dishes they’re uniquely qualified to discuss or dismantle — whether through personal or professional expertise — is an equation for passionate and eclectic criticism.

Some of these ideas may sound obvious, others inane. Food shelters aren’t restaurants! We’ve been calling for more diverse critics for years. But the connecting thread is an effort to redirect the review’s modus operandi from evaluating cookery to pursuing broader insight. Young critics must translate their grand ambitions for the genre’s future into editorial changes on the page. Although the last decade has seen a food renaissance, restaurant reviews remain trapped in the paralyzing norms of an older dining era. It is not enough to abolish outdated conventions — we must establish new traditions for a new century.

So let us rewrite the job description for the 21st-century food critic. Activist, futurist, Texan, Brooklynite, Vegan, Hindu, libertarian, or librarian — embrace whatever vocation or identity adds vitality to your writing. Define your own priorities. Cast out any convention that constrains your voice. Treat each review as an opportunity not to pass a verdict but to awaken empathy, arouse curiosity, and challenge received wisdom. Let the full palette of mortal emotions — from fury to euphoria — color your prose. The critic of tomorrow will teach us to savor our humanity as much as our meals.

By Andrew Chung

(Reuters) - U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concern on Tuesday about disinformation amplified by the internet and social media as he focused his year-end report on the weakening state of civics education in the United States.

""In our age, when social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand scale, the public's need to understand our government, and the protections it provides, is ever more vital,"" Roberts said in his annual report on behalf of the federal judiciary.

The chief justice warned that Americans ""have come to take democracy for granted, and civic education has fallen by the wayside.""

Roberts' comments come as U.S. legislators and officials have raised concerns about the persistence of foreign propaganda and false news aimed at sowing discord in the U.S. political system in the lead-up to the 2020 election.

U.S. intelligence agencies and an inquiry by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller found that Russia engaged in a campaign of hacking and propaganda to sway the 2016 presidential race toward Republican President Donald Trump. Mueller did not establish that members of Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election.

Roberts said in his report that an independent judiciary was a ""key source of national unity and stability"" and called on his judicial colleagues to promote public confidence and trust by reflecting on their duty to judge without fear or favor.

He has previously lamented the perception in an increasingly polarized society that lower courts and the Supreme Court are becoming politicized, and that judges are guided primarily by their partisan affiliations.

Trump has repeatedly criticized federal courts and judges who have blocked his policies, while some Democratic lawmakers have suggested that the Supreme Court's conservative majority is motivated mainly by politics instead of interpreting the law.

Roberts, 64, named to the court in 2005 by Republican President George W. Bush, is poised to preside over Trump's looming U.S. Senate impeachment trial, a highly visible yet largely ceremonial role.

By the end of June, the Supreme Court is expected to decide several major cases involving a number of hot-button issues including abortion rights, Trump's move to kill a program that protects young immigrants, dubbed ""Dreamers,"" who were brought to the United States illegally as children, and Trump’s bid to keep details of his finances secret.

Roberts listed in his report a number of ways his judicial colleagues had helped advance public understanding of the law and civics knowledge.

He cited the example of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, who volunteers as a tutor at a local elementary school. Garland's 2016 nomination to the Supreme Court by Democratic President Barack Obama was not taken up by the Republican-controlled Senate.

Roberts' annual report was released just a few days after the death of his mother, Rosemary Roberts, who died on Saturday at age 90.

2675,cb8d4123458c4a5925ba711d262c5a7c,"(Representative image) A December 26 notice said Hafiz had been found “prima facie responsible for damaging the properties” Shutterstock

Hafiz-ur-Rahman was picked up by police on December 24 when the young man was reading a newspaper at a tea stall not far from his home in the Madeganj area of old Lucknow.

Eyewitnesses said the policemen, from Hasanganj police station, beat him up with batons and rifle butts.

Someone told his mother, Asmat Jahan, that policemen were beating up Hafiz and she rushed to the tea stall to save him. But the policemen assaulted her too, leaving her left hand fractured.

They then dragged Hafiz into a jeep and whisked the 28-year-old away.

Hafiz was allegedly kept in the police station for two days before being sent to jail on December 26 on the charge of rioting, burning the Madeganj police outpost and attacking police personnel on duty on December 19, when protests had broken out in Lucknow against the controversial law.

Asmat, 52, met her son in Lucknow jail on December 27. He was badly injured, with bloodstains on both his knees and shoulder and he kept pleading with his mother to get him out of jail.

Hafiz’s torture is a familiar tale of alleged police brutality on protesters against the amended citizenship law.

Among those who have been arrested and sent to jail over protests on December 19 is Sadaf Jafar, a well-known social activist and Congress member who had gone live on social media at a protest site, Parivartan Chawk, showing how police and Rapid Action Force personnel stood watching as some people damaged public and private property.

Madeganj, where another protest had broken out, is around 3km from Parivartan Chawk.

But the script for Hafiz changed on December 28 when two policemen visited his house, looking for the young man.

“I came out when they knocked on the door. They asked me whether I was Hafiz-ur-Rahman,” Aziz-ur-Rahman, Hafiz’s younger brother, told The Telegraph on Tuesday.

“I said it was my elder brother’s name. They asked me where he was hiding. I said he was in Lucknow jail. Then they asked me to receive a notice issued in his name,” Aziz added.

“The policemen told me my brother was a Kashmiri camping in Lucknow for the last few days to throw stones at the police during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 19. They told me I would meet my brother’s fate if I didn’t stop repeating that Hafiz was a resident of Lucknow, had never visited Kashmir and there was none in Kashmir he knew,” Aziz said.

Aziz showed a medical report from King George’s Medical University, where Hafiz had taken their father Iqrar Mohammad, who has oral cancer, for therapy on December 19.

Asmat said Hafiz had studied up to Class IX in Shia College on Sitapur Road and worked for a contractor of the electricity department.

“He fixes electric meters wherever he is asked to. The police say they have video footage where he can be seen passing through a road where violence had erupted a few minutes later in the Madeganj area. It could be possible because he was coming back from the hospital at that time.

“I have been asking them (the police) to see CCTV footage from the KGMU pain clinic or show us that he was throwing stones at the police. But they misbehave with us whenever we go to Hasanganj police station to request them to withdraw the case against my son.

“We had fixed his marriage but now it wouldn’t be possible because nobody wants to marry their daughter off to someone who was in jail.”

The notice that Aziz received was dated December 26 and issued in Hindi in the name of Hafiz by Vishwa Bhushan Mishra, additional district magistrate.

“People gathered against the law and damaged the properties of Lok Nirman Vibhag, Nagar Nigam, police department and other government departments and other persons’ properties,” it said.

The notice quoted a 2010 order from the court that had then specified who would be responsible for damaging public and private property during protests.

Among those who would be responsible, the court had said, were people’s representatives of political parties who had organised the demonstration and even those elected in the past, and other individuals or groups identified for damaging properties.

The December 26 notice said Hafiz had been found “prima facie responsible for damaging the properties”.

“You appear in this court within a week and explain why not, in the light of the High Court order, you are held guilty of damaging public and private properties and the process is initiated for recovery against you,” the notice said, giving Hafiz a maximum of one month to prove his innocence.

Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, Lucknow, said: “The rioters were identified with the help of CCTV footage before they were arrested.”

He didn’t reply when asked how someone in jail would appear before the court."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
2717,89db4850d45fe85609e7513508389204,"The possibility that Iran will drag Israel in a developing military conflict with the United States presents an opportunity for Jerusalem.

Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter

Defense Minister Naftali Bennett's clear message to his staff regarding this potential conflict marks a shift in Israeli strategy.

Iran, according to Bennett, must be made to view the price of conflict with Israel as being too high.

If IDF strikes thus far have come in response to Iranian action, such as transporting weaponry intended to boost Iran's entrenchment efforts in Syria and Lebanon, Israel would now initiate an offensive campaign against the weaponry before it crosses the border from Iraq and at a substantial cost to Iranian lives.

There is no assurance that all the IDF general staff is in complete accordance with the new minister's aggressive plan, but one missile directed a major city such as at Haifa, for example, might sway those in doubt.

Should Iran decide to retaliate for the American attack on its militias in Iraq earlier this week, it would be playing into the hands of those in Jerusalem who are advocating the use of Iran's growing unpopularity in Iraq and its economic crisis at home to push the Islamic Republic out of Syria altogether.

The new year will likely see a military conflict between Iranian and American forces. The first indication of this came with the American attack on the Iraq-based Hezbollah Brigade militia on Sunday.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a clear warning to Iraq last June, when he said that the death of an American on Iraqi soil would be a violation of the red line as far as the administration is concerned. And that has now come to pass.

There are two accelerating factors that may come into play.

One is aggressive military action by Iran, either directly or through its proxies, against the United States and its allies in the region.

If Tehran decides to bring Israel into the conflict as leverage against the United States, Jerusalem will be forced to engage in battle with Iranian forces in Syria and perhaps Lebanon as well.

Another accelerating factor would be more violations of the 2015 nuclear deal.

The Islamic Republic made its first move on November 4, when it announced steps that distance it from compliance with the deal.

These violations could see Iran nearing production of uranium to a grade 10 time higher than the agreement allows by the spring of 2020.

That would put the Iran nuclear project, as far as both Israel and the United States are concerned, at a breakthrough position towards a nuclear weapon.

Tehran has been warning that as of January their uranium enrichment will rise above 4.5%, using new technology banned by the nuclear deal.

This could be the moment European signatories decide to join the U.S. sanctions, leaving all options for further conflict open and presenting an opportunity for preventive measures to be taken by either Israel, the United States or some other player."," Threaten, not specified below",3
2731,86e9fd5bee4ff79e299c32e974207caf,"BEIJING — China’s Huawei Technologies said Tuesday that its sales rose a lower-than-projected 18% in 2019, and it predicted tough times ahead as the U.S. moves to restrict its business.

The preliminary sales estimate came in an annual New Year’s message to employees. Chairman Eric Xu warned that mediocre managers would face demotion as the telecom giant and leader in 5G mobile technology focuses on survival.

“It’s going to be a difficult year for us,” he wrote, calling on the company’s more than 190,000 employees “to work hard and go the extra mile to bring their capabilities to a new level.”

No one is predicting Huawei’s demise. The unlisted company, a major maker of both mobile transmission equipment and handsets, estimated that 2019 sales would rise to more than $120 billion.

“These figures are lower than our initial projections, yet business remains solid and we stand strong in the face of adversity,” Xu said in the letter, which was released to the news media.

Huawei, based in the tech hub of Shenzhen in southern China, typically releases its official and audited annual financial results in March.

Zou Zhidan, an analyst at the consulting firm Zero Power in Shenzhen, said that given Huawei’s size and the breadth of its business, the company won’t face a survival crisis. Rather, it will face obstacles to progress and pressure on its rapid profit growth, he said in an email.

Zou noted that Huawei enjoys a relatively good reputation outside of the U.S. and will benefit from its leading position in the still nascent 5G market.

“The difficulties for Huawei in 2020 won’t be small, but the company has its own strengths,” Zou wrote.

The U.S. government says Huawei technology poses a security risk and has urged other countries not to buy its 5G mobile network equipment. It has placed Huawei on the entity list, which restricts certain exports, re-exports or transfers. It effectively blocks U.S. technology sales to the company.

Huawei denies the allegation that it is a security risk.

Calling difficulty the prelude to greater success, Xu said America’s “strategic and long-term” campaign against Huawei is an opportunity to build up some muscle and build capabilities to navigate future challenges.

“Despite concerted efforts by the U.S. government to keep us down, we’ve made it out the other side and continue to create value for our customers,” he wrote.

The five-page letter exhorts employees to hone their skills and rid themselves of complacency. Saying that survival is the company’s top priority, Xu warns that mediocre managers “who have lost their enterprising spirit” will be removed faster than before.

Rivian Automotive expanding

The electric-vehicle manufacturer had several large announcements in 2019, including millions of dollars in funding and a contract to supply Amazon with an electric fleet of vans.

The latest round of funding, led by T. Rowe Price, totaled $1.3 billion in December. This followed two other large investments of $700 and $500 million. Rivian purchased the former Mitsubishi Plant in 2017. By 2020 when production begins, Rivian leadership said it expects to employ 1,000.

Archbishop Fulton Sheen beatification planned, then postponed

After a three-year long litigious bout between the Archdiocese of New York and the Peoria Diocese, Archbishop Fulton Sheen's remains were returned to Peoria at the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception.

Following the return of Sheen's remains, the Vatican then called for Sheen's beatification to be held in December of 2019. However, the ceremony was postponed due to a few members of the Bishop's Conference asking for further consideration.

Peoria County loses three leaders in same week

The week of June 10, 2019 saw the deaths of three leaders of Peoria County.

Peoria County State's Attorney Jerry Brady, County Clerk Steve Sonnemaker and County Board Member Dr. Greg Adamson all died in the same week, with memorial services having hundreds attend to pay respects.

Peoria's deadliest year in two decades

The city of Peoria recorded 25 homicides in 2019, making it the deadliest year in two decades.

One of the homicide victims, 4-year-old Jeremiah Ward, was shot to death in May, causing an outcry from community leaders about reducing violence in the city.

However, the killings continued after Ward's death, including one of a 14 year old, Zaveon Marks, was found guilty by a jury in the shooting death of 16-year-old Zarious Fair.

Heavy rains delay planting season for Illinois farmers

Aside from the Illinois River being at flood warning stage for nearly six months, area farmers were also impacted by the heavy spring rains.

Planting season was about a month behind, pushing back the harvest. In late September, the Peoria County Farm Bureau reported only 5 percent of crops had been harvested.

Jesus statue vandalized in Peoria's south side

A statue of Jesus Christ with the hopes of bringing a community together was vandalized in July in Peoria’s south side, leaving a hole where the face should be and the hands removed.

The community then rallied to help raise funds for a new statue to be placed at Serenity Memorial Park. Initial costs were estimated at $15,000 to replace the statue.

The new one was placed at the park in December, with a formal unveiling to take place in the spring of 2020.

2767,102ded40c2fad511a39da357981add9c,"Kim Jong Un: North Korea ending test moratoriums



Seoul, Dec 31 (AFP) Dec 31, 2019



North Korea is abandoning its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, leader Kim Jong Un has declared according to state media Wednesday.

The North has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been at the centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the last two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump, but little tangible progress.

Analysts said the declaration amounted to Kim putting a missile ""to Donald Trump's head"" -- but that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's ""promise"" to him not to carry them out, and has played down launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February, and the North set the US an end-of-year deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a ""new way"".

""There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,"" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim telling top ruling party officials.

""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" he added.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party -- an indication of a major policy shift -- and the KCNA report came ahead of Kim's annual New Year speech, a key moment in the North Korean political calendar, reviewing the past and setting out goals for the future.

It will be Kim's eighth such address, after he revived the tradition started by his grandfather -- North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung -- but discontinued during his father's rule.

Kim made clear to party officials that the North was willing to live under international sanctions to preserve its nuclear capability.

""The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,"" KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had ""conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop"" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said, and stepped up sanctions against the North.

""We can never sell our dignity,"" he added, saying Pyongyang would ""shift to a shocking actual action to make (the US) pay for the pains sustained by our people"".



- 'Geopolitical chicken' -



For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up.

""North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump's head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,"" said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

""Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,"" he added.

""He is gambling that threatening another demonstration of his ability to hit the US homeland with a nuclear weapon will somehow push America into granting more concessions.""

But the strategy was unlikely to be effective, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with ""more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account"".

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carried out a long-range missile test.

At the weekend Trump's National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien said the administration would be ""extraordinarily disappointed and we'll demonstrate that disappointment"".

""We have a lot of tools in our toolkit, and additional pressure can be brought to bear on the North Koreans,"" he said.

An ICBM launch would also be likely to frustrate China, the North's key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own back yard.

But ties between Pyongyang and Beijing have warmed markedly in the past two years, with Chinese President Xi Jinping paying his first visit to the North as head of state in June, and Beijing and Washington at loggerheads over trade and other issues.

In December China and Russia -- another key economic partner for the North -- proposed loosening UN sanctions against Pyongyang, and analysts say Kim is likely to seek to exploit rivalries between Washington, Beijing and Moscow."," Threaten, not specified below",3

California's Minimum Wages and Exempt Salary Thresholds Increase in 2020

SB 3, enacted in the 2015-2016 legislative session, sets forth a schedule for minimum wage increases through 2023.

Beginning Jan. 1, 2020, for employers with 26 employees or more, the minimum wage will increase from $12 per hour to $13 per hour, and the exempt annual salary threshold will increase from $49,920 to $54,080.

For employers with 25 employees or less, the minimum wage will increase from $11 per hour to $12, and the exempt annual salary threshold will increase from $45,760 to $49,920.

AB 5 – Codification and Expansion of Strict ABC Test for Independent Contractor Status

As discussed in a previous alert, AB 5 codifies the strict ""ABC"" test for employee versus independent contractor classification adopted by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles (Dynamex), 4 Cal. 5th 903 (2018). Dynamex was limited to California Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) Wage Order violations. But AB 5 expands the reach of the ""ABC"" test generally to Labor Code violations, as well as to California unemployment insurance and workers' compensation proceedings.

The codified test in the newly created Section 2750.3 of the Labor Code provides that a person providing labor or services for remuneration shall be considered an employee rather than an independent contractor unless the hiring entity demonstrates that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

A. the person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of work and in fact

B. the person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business

C. the person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation or business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed

AB 5 includes seven categories of exemptions for 1) specific occupations, 2) certain contracts for ""professional services,"" 3) certain real estate licensees and repossession agencies, 4) certain bona fide business-to-business contracting relationships, 5) certain relationships between contractors and individuals working under a subcontract in the construction industry, 6) certain relationships between referral agencies and service providers, and 7) certain relationships related to motor club services. AB 170, also passed signed into law this legislative session, created additional exemptions for a newspaper distributor working under contract with a newspaper publisher, and a newspaper carrier working under contract either with a newspaper publisher or newspaper distributor.

The ""exemptions"" are not true carve-outs – an individual whose work meets the exemption requirements is not automatically an independent contractor. Rather, an individual whose work meets the exemptions means that the ABC test does not apply, but the hiring party must still be able to demonstrate that contractor status is appropriate under Borello and/or by other statutory provisions as specified in the bill.

AB 5 specifically provides that it ""does not constitute a change in, but is declaratory of, existing law, with regard to wage orders of the [IWC] and violations of the Labor Code related to wage orders."" Thus, the strong indication is that the ABC test will apply retroactively, at least as to wage and hour claims. However, AB 5 also provides that the exemptions in categories 1 through 7 above will apply retroactively to existing claims and actions to the maximum extent permitted by law.

In addition to adding Section 2750.3 to the Labor Code, AB 5 also amends Section 3351 of the Labor Code, the workers' compensation definition of ""employee."" AB 5 provides that for purposes of workers' compensation, ""employee"" will include individuals who are employees under Section 2750.3 ""[b]eginning on July 1, 2020,"" but that the subdivision ""shall not apply retroactively.""

AB 5 also amends Section 621 of the Unemployment Insurance Code to restate the ABC test as one of the definitions of ""employee"" for unemployment insurance purposes. However, there is no similar statement as to retroactivity and, given that the addition will not become effective until Jan. 1, 2020, it remains to be seen whether the ABC test will apply retroactively for unemployment insurance purposes.

AB 9 – Statute of Limitations for Filing Complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment Extended from One Year to Three Years

Under current law, a person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful practice under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) must generally file a verified complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) within one year from the date upon which the alleged unlawful conduct occurred. AB 9 extends this this timeframe to three years subject to specified exceptions.

SB 778 – Harassment-Prevention Training Compliance Deadline Extended for Smaller Employers and Nonsupervisory Employees to Jan. 1, 2021

The FEHA requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide sexual harassment prevention training to all supervisory employees within six months of their assumption of a supervisory position and once every two years.

SB 1343, which as passed in the 2017-2018 legislative session, extended training requirements to small employers and to nonsupervisory employees. More specifically, the bill required that by Jan. 1, 2020, employers with five or more employees provide at least two hours of sexual harassment prevention training to supervisory employees, and at least one hour of sexual harassment prevention training to nonsupervisory employees within six months of their assumption of a position.

SB 778 extends this compliance date to Jan. 1, 2021. The bill makes clear that an employer who has provided this training in 2019 is not required to provide it again until two years thereafter.

AB 51 – Restrictions on Applicant/Employee Waiver of Rights, Forums and Procedures for Alleged Violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and Labor Code [UPDATE:On Dec. 30, 2019, a Temporary Restraining Order Issued to Prevent the Enforcement of AB 51 Pending Resolution of a Preliminary Injunction Motion to be Heard on Jan. 10, 2020]

AB 51, aimed at curbing mandatory employment arbitration agreements, adds section 432.6 to the Labor Code. Section 432.6 prohibits employers from requiring applicants or employees from waiving any rights, forums or procedures for alleged violations of the FEHA or Labor Code, as a condition of employment, continued employment or the receipt of any employment-related benefit. AB 51 prohibits threatening, retaliating or discriminating against for refusal to consent to any such waiver.

AB 51 applies to agreements entered into or extended on or after Jan. 1, 2020, but does not apply to post-dispute settlement agreements or negotiated severance agreements.

By its express language, the bill is not intended to invalidate a written arbitration agreement that is otherwise enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act.

Employers should note that on Dec. 6, 2019, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among other parties, filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California seeking to invalidate AB 51 as preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act.

UPDATE: On Dec. 30, 2019, a U.S. District Court judge issued a Temporary Restraining Order to prevent the enforcement of AB 51 pending resolution of a preliminary injunction motion to be heard on Jan. 10, 2020. Employers should carefully monitor the outcome of this preliminary injunction motion which, if granted, would halt the enforcement of AB 51 pending the outcome of the federal lawsuit on the merits.

SB 707 – Strict Enforcement and Penalties for Failure to Timely Comply with Arbitration Fee Provisions in Arbitration Agreements

SB 707 is an arbitration agreement enforcement provision that creates strict penalties for failure to comply with the agreement, particular the timely payment of any arbitration fees and costs. Specifically, it provides that any drafting party to an arbitration agreement that fails to pay the fees needed to commence or continue arbitration, within 30 days after such fees are due, is held to have materially breached the agreement and, as such, is in default and waives its right to compel arbitration.

SB 707 further provides remedies to employees for such a material breach of the arbitration agreement. In particular, it enables the employee to remove the matter to court or move to compel arbitration. For instance, if the drafting party fails to pay the required arbitration fees to continue an arbitration that is currently in progress, the employee can move the matter to court; seek a court order compelling payment of the fees; continue the arbitration and permit the arbitrator to seek collection of their fees; or pay the costs and fees and seek them from the drafting party at the conclusion of the arbitration regardless of the outcome of the arbitration. SB 707 also provides for the tolling of the statute of limitations with regard to all claims brought in the arbitration.

SB 707 also imposes mandatory monetary sanctions on any drafting party found to be in default of an arbitration through such a failure to pay the arbitration fees and costs. Most notably, it also allows the court or arbitrator to impose evidentiary, terminating or contempt sanctions. Lastly, SB 707 requires private arbitration companies to collect and report aggregate demographic data of all arbitrators.

Accordingly, employers should pay careful attention to timely pay any arbitration fees and costs in order to preserve its right to arbitration and avoid any potential sanctions.

AB 25 – One-Year Exemption for Certain Applicant- and Employee-Related Data under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) relates to the collection, use and protection of consumer data. While the CCPA goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2020, AB 25 exempts certain applicant- and employee-related data collected by businesses covered under the CCPA until Jan. 1, 2021. Despite this one-year exemption, covered businesses must still provide certain disclosures to applicants and employees regarding the collection and sharing of personal information, and can be subject to private lawsuits in the event of certain data breaches.

AB 673 – Employees May Now Recover Statutory Penalties for Employer's Late Payment Wages During Employment

Under current law, Labor Code section 210 provides that only the Labor Commissioner may recover civil penalties for employer violations of the Labor Code sections 201.3, 204, 204b, 204.1, 204.2, 205, 205.5, and 1197.5, which includes late payment of wages during employment. AB 673 amends Section 210 to allow employees to sue employers directly for statutory penalties under Section 210 for violations of the aforementioned Labor Code sections, as well as Section 204.11, at the following rates: 1) for any initial violation, $100 for each failure to pay each employee; 2) for each subsequent violation, or any willful or intentional violation, $200 for each failure to pay each employee, plus 25 percent of the amount unlawfully withheld.

AB 673 also specifies that an employee may only recover either statutory penalties under Labor Code section 210, or civil penalties under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (PAGA) for violations of the same violations. In other words, there will be no double recovery of penalties arising from the same Labor Code violation.

AB 749 – Restrictions on the Use of ""No-Rehire"" and ""No Future Employment"" Clauses in Settlement Agreements

A common type of term in settlement agreements arising from a dispute between an employee and an employer, especially when the employee is no longer employed by the employer, is one that specifies that the employee is not to apply for a position with the employer in the future, makes clear that the employee has no guarantee of future employment with the employer, or establishes that the employer does not have to consider any application for employment submitted by that employee. AB 749 sharply restricts, if not precludes, the use of these types of clauses.

AB 749 adds Section 1002.5 to the Code of Civil Procedure. The new Section 1002.5 provides that settlement agreements resolving employment disputes ""shall not contain a provision prohibiting, preventing, or otherwise restricting a settling party that is an aggrieved person from obtaining future employment with the employer against which the aggrieved person has filed a claim[.]"" Any provision of a covered agreement entered into after Jan. 1, 2020, which violates Section 1002.5 is void as a matter of law and void as against public policy.

The section does not preclude the employer and employee from entering into an agreement that ends the employment relationship. Also, an employer may restrict future employment opportunities or rehire eligibility with the employer when the employer has made a good-faith determination that the aggrieved employee engaged in sexual harassment or sexual assault. Finally, nothing in the section requires an employer to employ or rehire a person if there is a legitimate non-discriminatory or non-retaliatory reason for terminating the employment relationship or refusing to rehire the person.

SB 142 – Expanded Lactation Accommodation Requirements

SB 142 amends Sections 1030, 1031 and 1033 of the California Labor Code and adds a new Section 1034. In general, these changes now require all employers to provide an employee a break to express breast milk for the employee's infant child each time they need to express milk. The breaks may run concurrently with any break already provided to the employee, but any such breaks that do not run concurrently with another break may be unpaid. To accommodate such breaks, employers must provide the employee with a clean and safe room or other location to express milk in private that is close to the employee's work area. The room or location must satisfy certain conditions, including 1) contain a surface to place a breast pump and personal items; 2) contain a place to sit; and 3) have access to electricity or another device that enables the use of an electric or battery-powered breast pump. The room cannot be a bathroom. In addition, employers must provide access to a sink with running water and a refrigerator suitable for storing milk (or, if a refrigerator cannot be provided, some other suitable cooling device) that is close to the employee's workspace. Multiple employers in the same building can provide a shared space within the building/worksite if an employer cannot provide a lactation location within the employer's own workspace.

Failure to comply with the new Labor Code requirements constitutes a violation of Labor Code Section 226.7, which requires the employer to pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee's regular rate of pay for each workday that an accommodating break period is not provided. In addition, an employee may file a complaint under Labor Code Section 98 for employer violations of the new Labor Code requirements. Employers are prohibited from discharging or in any way retaliating against an employee for exercising or attempting to exercise rights under the new Labor Code requirements. If the Labor Commissioner determines that a violation of the requirements has occurred, the Labor Commissioner may impose a penalty of $100 for each day an employee is denied reasonable break time or an adequate space to express milk.

Under new Labor Code Section 1034, employers must also develop and implement a policy regarding lactation accommodation that includes, in part, 1) a statement about the employee's right to request lactation accommodation and the process to make such a request, and 2) a statement about the employee's right to file a complaint with the Labor Commissioner for any violation of such right. The policy must be provided in the employee handbook or set of policies the employer provides to employees.

Employers with fewer than 50 employees may qualify for an exemption if it can demonstrate that complying with the requirement would impose an undue hardship, but the employer must still make reasonable efforts to provide employees with a room or other location to express milk in private.

SB 188 – CROWN Act: Race Discrimination Protections Expanded to Traits Historically Associated with Race Such As Hair Textures and Protective Hairstyles

SB 188, known as the CROWN Act, amends Section 212.1 of the California Education Code and Section 12926 of the California Government Code to expand the definition of ""Race"" to include traits historically associated with race, such as hair texture and ""protective hairstyles."" The term ""protective hairstyles"" is defined to include, but not be limited to, ""braids, locks, and twists."" As a result, workplace dress codes and grooming policies may not prohibit such ""protective hairstyles,"" otherwise such dress codes/grooming policies will be found to discriminate on the basis of race.

SB 229 – Expedited Procedural Requirements For The Administrative Enforcement of Unlawful Retaliation Citations

SB 229, which amends Section 98.74 of the Labor Code, expands the administrative enforcement of the Labor Commissioner's citations for enforcement of the anti-retaliation provisions of the Labor Code. Specifically, if the Labor Commissioner investigates a retaliation complaint and determines that the employer violated the Labor Code, the Labor Commissioner may issue a citation to the person or employer who is responsible for the violation. SB 229 establishes expedited procedural requirements and deadlines for the Labor Commissioner to file such citations with the court for judicial enforcement and the collection of remedies. It also sets out the procedural requirements for anyone who wishes to appeal such a citation. Specifically, if the employer does not request an informal hearing with the Labor Commissioner within 30 days after service of the citation, the citation becomes final, and 10 days later, the Labor Commissioner is required to apply for an entry of judgment.

SB 688 – Labor Commissioner's Citation Authority Expanded to the Recovery of ""Contract Wages""

SB 688 amends Section 1197.1 of the Labor Code in a couple of ways. First, it expands the Labor Commissioner's citation authority to include citations for recovery of ""contract wages,"" which are wages, based on an agreement, in excess of the applicable minimum wage for regular, nonovertime hours. Accordingly, the Labor Commissioner can now hold employers liable for the failure to pay wages set by contract, regardless of whether all of the hours were actually paid at or above the minimum wage, and in essence now permits the Labor Commissioner to enforce breach of contract claims for wages. As such, employers should ensure that any agreement setting out an employee's wages is clearly communicated and, most importantly, that the employee accurately paid, pursuant to the agreement, for all of the hours worked.

SB 688 also amends the procedure involved in contesting the assessment of such a civil penalty. As it exists, California law requires an employer seeking to file a writ of mandate with the court to contest the Labor Commissioner's assessment of a civil penalty to post an ""undertaking"" in a specified amount, some or all of which may be forfeited to the affected employee if the employer does not pay the court's judgment, regarding any wages or damages owed, within 10 days of the entry of judgment. SB 688 now provides that the ""undertaking"" will instead be forfeited to the Labor Commissioner for appropriate distribution.", Bring lawsuit against ,3
2829,b96d85272a46776cd7503cf341dffb33,"A crowdfunding appeal to raise money for legal support for a British teenager found guilty of lying about being gang-raped has passed £80,000.

The “help teen victim get justice in Cyprus” GoFundMe page was set up by British lawyer John Hobbs in August to raise cash for the 19-year-old’s legal representation.

The teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in the party town of Ayia Napa on July 17.

But she was charged and the dozen young men, aged between 15 and 20, who were arrested over the incident, were freed after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later.

The woman, who had been due to go to university in September, claimed in court she was raped but forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police.

The GoFundMe page has continued to receive thousands of pounds in donations after the woman was found guilty on Monday, and had hit its £80,000 target on Tuesday night.

The Foreign Office said the UK was “seriously concerned” about the fairness of the woman’s trial and it is understood officials have raised the “deeply distressing case” with the Cypriot authorities.

Lawyers and campaigners criticised the justice system after she was convicted of public mischief at Famagusta District Court, in Paralimni, on Monday.

And the psychologist who assessed the woman as part of her defence case, Dr Christine Tizzard, said she was concerned the trial had not fully considered that she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

She told the Guardian: “The salient point is that she was diagnosed with PTSD. That’s a standalone diagnosis. It’s a valid diagnosis and it hasn’t really been fully represented.

“Aside the fact it hasn’t been fully represented, it means she’s been unable to get the treatment she so sorely needs and every day she’s not having treatment the worse it gets.”

But the government of Cyprus has said it has “full confidence in the justice system and the courts”.

Cyprus’ attorney general said on Tuesday that he could not suspend the trial because she had levelled “grave accusations” against police investigators that had to be adjudicated in court.

He said the woman’s allegation that police coerced her into retracting her rape claim “could not have been left to linger” so he could not move to suspend the trial.

In a statement, Mr Clerides added: “Any intervention on the part of the attorney general, either for reasons of public interest or any other reasons, would have constituted nothing more than an obstacle to ascertaining the true facts of the case, as well as interference in the judiciary’s work.”

Judge Michalis Papathanasiou said he believed the woman had made false allegations because she felt “embarrassed” after realising she had been filmed having sex in a video found on some of the Israelis’ mobile phones.

“The defendant gave police a false rape claim, while having full knowledge that this was a lie,” he said.

“There was no rape, or violence, and police had carried out a thorough investigation making all necessary arrests.”

The woman has been on bail since the end of August, after spending a month in prison, and could face up to a year in jail and a 1,700 euro (£1,500) fine when she is sentenced on January 7.

Her lawyers said they will appeal against the verdict in the Supreme Court of Cyprus and the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.

The teenager said that she was “dedicated to seeking true justice”, while her mother described the verdict as “absolutely astonishing” and said her daughter was “effectively in a gilded cage” as she awaits sentencing on the island.", Sexually assault,3
2830,63e088e394c6c5cd9ac89b7d9477a822,"A barbaric misstep

Supporters of harsher penalties for rape greet each fresh case of serious sexual assault with demands for a new law that inflicts severe punishment such as the death penalty on culprits.

In the wake of the murder of a 51-year-old woman by former serial killer and rapist Somkid Pumpuang last month, there came a proposal for a law to force convicted rapists to undergo castration -- either chemically or surgically. Lawmakers should be cautious in deliberating this proposal. The idea is both extreme and inhumane. More pertinently, it is questionable whether such a punishment would do anything to deter would-be assailants and thus prevent rape.

The idea was floated in the House of Representatives by Democrat MP for Samut Songkhram Rangsima Rodrasmi, on Dec 26. The House has set up an extraordinary committee to study measures to prevent sex crimes.

Thailand had already adopted a harsher stance against rape. An amendment to the Criminal Code that took effect in May last year imposes the death penalty on rapists who also cause the death of their victims.

The new law received a mixed response, mainly because Thailand's previous efforts to amend the law to prevent sex crimes had not been successful in reducing the number of rape cases.

Some people cautioned that instead of solely promoting harsher penalties, policy makers should come up with integrated measures to tackle the causes of rape.

They reasoned that there are many factors contributing to the high incidence of rape, including the way cases are handled by the justice process, and these need to be taken into account.

Among those factors is the prevalence of male chauvinism in society. As long as we do not promote social values that sufficiently respect women's rights, harsher punishments will never be enough to prevent rape.

At the same time, an insufficient number of female police officers has also made it difficult for rape victims to seek justice. The male-dominated police force has been criticised for brushing aside rape complaints in favour of pressuring victims to mediate with their attackers.

Further muddying the judicial process are well-documented flaws in the Thai justice system that have seen men framed for rape.

Despite opposition from groups advocating women's and human rights, the latest controversial proposal has won strong backing from Justice Minister Somsak Thepsutin, who said he supported the idea if the majority of lawmakers and the public agree with it.

The minister is unwise to back such an extreme measure, especially since it was floated following a crime committed by serial killer Somkid after his release on parole from a life sentence in May.

The early release was a mistake on the part of the Corrections Department, which apparently failed to evaluate Somkid properly. It also demonstrates failures in prisoner rehabilitation.

Mr Somsak did make a good point, though, when he said new legal measures were needed to monitor sex offenders or even throw them back in jail for repeat offending.

Lawmakers and policy makers should treat this matter with care. Without a doubt, rape is a crime that needs to be seriously tackled. But we should look at all dimensions of the nature of this crime and promote integrated measures to prevent it and effectively help victims to seek justice. The barbaric proposal of castration has no place in such a reasoned approach.", Sexually assault,3

Tehran, Dec 31 (AFP) Dec 31, 2019



Tehran hit out Tuesday at the ""audacity"" of Washington to blame it for violent anti-US demonstrations in Iraq, warning the United States to review its policies in the region.

""The surprising audacity of American officials is so much that after killing at least 25... and violating the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, that now... they attribute the Iraqi people's protest against their cruel acts to the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi.

His statement came after US President Donald Trump accused Iran of killing an American civilian contractor and ""orchestrating"" the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad earlier on Tuesday.

Mousavi said the claim was an insult to the people of Iraq.

""How and based on what logic do you expect the nation of Iraq to be silent in the face of all these atrocities?"" he asked.

In response to rocket attacks that killed the contractor in northern Iraq, the US launched air strikes Monday on an Iran-backed militant group that killed 25 people in western Iraq.

""The Americans ignore the Iraqi nation's liberty and drive for independence on one hand, and on the other forget their own role in supporting Saddam and Daesh,"" Mousavi said, referring to former dictator Saddam Hussein and the Islamic State group.

3153,5de2b156cea8fa2a8e5c70a3d59d8a77,"Taipei, Taiwan – Taiwan’s legislature on Tuesday passed a law aimed at blocking political interference from China, less than two weeks before presidential and legislative elections.

The approval of the the Anti-Infiltration Law follows accusations that China is strongly backing candidates from the main opposition Nationalist Party, including providing campaign funds and mobilizing support on social media.

President Tsai Ing-wen is favored to win a second term in the Jan. 11 election, an outcome that would likely intensify China’s economic, diplomatic and military pressure over her refusal to accept its insistence that Taiwan is a part of China. China cut ties with Tsai’s government shortly after her 2016 election and has sought to isolate it diplomatically while ramping up its threat to use force to annex the self-governing island republic.

During Tuesday’s debate, legislators from Tsai’s majority Democratic Progressive Party cited allegations of China seeking to manipulate politics in democracies such as Australia and the countermeasures those governments took.

“We expect everyone to think calmly and carefully for the safeguarding of the democratic environment in Taiwan. We certainly don’t want it to be interfered with by China’s money and strength,” DPP lawmaker Wang Ding-yu said during Tuesday’s debate prior to voting.

In Beijing, a spokeswoman for the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office condemned the law’s passage as an act that seeks to undermine relations between the two sides.

“Those who provoke hostility must eat their own bitter fruit,” Zhu Fenglian was quoted as saying by the official China News Service.

The law seeks to plug legal loopholes by blocking any foreign force from making illegal political donations, spreading misinformation, staging campaign events, or otherwise interfering in elections and the business of government.

Nationalist legislators argued that the law would threaten anyone with dealings in China, where hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese work, live and study. Those found guilty could be sentenced to up to five years in prison and fined the equivalent of more than $333,000.

“The new direction in public opinion will be formed up after the presidential election on Jan. 11. We shouldn’t pass this important bill in a rush,” Nationalist legislator Tseng Ming-chung told the assembly.

Some opposition politicians protested briefly, sitting on the floor of the chamber and chanting slogans denouncing the legislation.

While the bill has been before the legislature for weeks, it was fast-tracked by the ruling DPP after the Nationalists nominated at-large candidates for the legislature with close ties to China’s Communist Party.

Prosecutors in December also detained 10 people, including a former Nationalist Party staffer, on suspicion of falsifying documents to bring thousands of mainland Chinese to Taiwan, possibly including some who were collecting intelligence.

Concern has also been raised about Beijing’s influence over Taiwanese media groups, many of which are owned by corporations with business and political connections in China. Beijing has also been actively wooing retired Taiwanese generals, many of whom are descended from mainland Chinese families allied with the Nationalists who moved to the island after the sides split amid civil war in 1949.

(FOX NEWS) – Trump administration officials and U.S. lawmakers turned up pressure on Iraq’s government to keep American personnel in the country safe, after a stunning assault on the embassy in Baghdad renewed concerns about the influence of Iran.

Dozens of Iraqi Shiite militiamen and their supporters breached the compound Tuesday, smashing a main door and setting fire to a reception area as protests raged over U.S. airstrikes over the weekend that killed members of the Iran-backed militia.

President Trump accused Iran of “orchestrating” the attack, while defending the airstrikes as in response to an attack that killed an American contractor.

A U.S. defense official told Fox News that 100 Marines were being sent to the embassy to bolster security. A U.S. Apache helicopter gunship also flew over the embassy and dropped flares in a “show of force,” attempting to disperse the crowd.

The multi-agency effort aims to crackdown on preventable deaths caused by stray bullets and officials are asking people to report if they see or hear celebratory gunfire.

“Beginning tonight, New Year’s Eve, as part of an ongoing initiative, Crime Stoppers of Houston will offer increased rewards for credible reports of celebratory gunfire,” officials wrote in a press release Tuesday. “HPD will respond citywide to such reports and by policy now requires officers to collect ballistics evidence found at all actual crime scenes.

By offering cash rewards through Crime Stoppers, officials hope to incentivize tipsters to report dangerous behavior that could lead to people getting hurt or killed.

“People shooting guns into the air will be prosecuted, and the firearms and bullet casings will be tested against the national database to determine if they are connected to any past crime,” said Kim Ogg, Harris County District Attorney.

After barricading himself in the car for six hours, he was taken into custody. Rockford Police Chief Daniel O'Shea spoke with the media after the standoff ended.

3350,c5a4af6b115f99c399df321a54b51275,"Seoul: North Korea is abandoning its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, leader Kim Jong-un has declared according to state media on Wednesday.

The North has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been at the centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the last two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump, but little tangible progress.

Analysts said the declaration amounted to Kim putting a missile ""to Donald Trump's head"" -- but that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's ""promise"" to him not to carry them out, and has played down launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February, and the North set the US an end-of-year deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a ""new way"".

""There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,"" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim telling top ruling party officials.

""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" he added.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party -- an indication of a major policy shift -- and the KCNA report came ahead of Kim's annual New Year speech, a key moment in the North Korean political calendar, reviewing the past and setting out goals for the future.

It will be Kim's eighth such address, after he revived the tradition started by his grandfather -- North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung -- but discontinued during his father's rule.

Kim made clear to party officials that the North was willing to live under international sanctions to preserve its nuclear capability.

""The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,"" KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had ""conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop"" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said, and stepped up sanctions against the North.

""We can never sell our dignity,"" he added, saying Pyongyang would ""shift to a shocking actual action to make (the US) pay for the pains sustained by our people"".

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up.

""North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump's head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,"" said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

""Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,"" he added.

""He is gambling that threatening another demonstration of his ability to hit the US homeland with a nuclear weapon will somehow push America into granting more concessions."" But the strategy was unlikely to be effective, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with ""more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account"".

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carried out a long-range missile test.

At the weekend Trump's National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien said the administration would be ""extraordinarily disappointed and we'll demonstrate that disappointment"".

""We have a lot of tools in our toolkit, and additional pressure can be brought to bear on the North Koreans,"" he said.

An ICBM launch would also be likely to frustrate China, the North's key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own back yard.

But ties between Pyongyang and Beijing have warmed markedly in the past two years, with Chinese President Xi Jinping paying his first visit to the North as head of state in June, and Beijing and Washington at loggerheads over trade and other issues.

In December, China and Russia -- another key economic partner for the North -- proposed loosening UN sanctions against Pyongyang, and analysts say Kim is likely to seek to exploit rivalries between Washington, Beijing and Moscow. (AFP)"," Threaten, not specified below",3

Among those titles, the bakery took out the Best Gourmet Pie in the Great Aussie Pie competition at the Fine Foods Festival in Sydney, earlier this year.

Mr Rose said the secret to the bakery's success comes in quality ingredients despite rising costs in the industry and the mass commercialisation of the industry.

""A lot of prices are going up, some companies can import (ingredients) for cheaper,"" Mr Rose said.

""And the only way we compete with that is make a great product."""," Physically assault, not specified below",3
3473,4d872a1dee8c098c070ee4cdc132712c,"The scourge of sexual exploitation of children has reached “epidemic” levels in the United Kingdom, as nearly 19,000 children were sexually groomed over the past year.

Local authorities have reported over 18,700 suspected victims of child sexual exploitation at the hands of grooming gangs between 2018-19, more than five times higher than the 3,300 reported cases just five years ago.

Sammy Woodhouse, a victim of the Rotherham rapist Arshid Hussain, said that the authorities have not implemented meaningful changes in combatting the crisis.

“You hear this bullshit line, ‘lessons have been learned’, but they haven’t learned anything”, she told The Independent.

“I still hear a lot about the authorities aren’t doing things as they should. It’s not very often I hear something good and for all different reasons – if the police won’t act on reports, people feel they’re not being listened to or supported properly, or information not being shared”, she added.

“I’ve said for years that this country’s in epidemic when it comes to abuse and exploitation. Authorities claim it’s under control but it’s not”, Woodhouse concluded.

Grooming Gang: ‘White Women Are Good for Only One Thing – for People Like Me to F*** and Use as Trash’https://t.co/5UyZNCelhR — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 10, 2017

Lancashire was the locality hit the hardest last year, with a total of 624 suspected victims, followed by Birmingham with 490, 447 in Surrey, 414 in Bradford and 409 in Gloucestershire. Thousands of more cases of abuse have been discovered across the country over the past decade, especially as the scandals of predominantly Pakistani male child rape gangs have been exposed.

The Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, said that the figures demonstrate that grooming “remains one of the largest forms of child abuse in the country”.

“The government has singularly failed to tackle this issue head-on. Its approach has been piecemeal and underfunded”, she said.

The Home Office has allocated 7 million pounds to support survivors of child sex abuse for 2019-20 and has set up investigations into the institutional responses to the scandals in Rotherham and Norfolk, with a series of public hearings expected in the spring of 2020.

“The Home Office is committed to tackling child sexual abuse and will leave no stone unturned in tackling this abhorrent behaviour”, a spokesperson said.

“This is why we launched the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse to get to the truth, expose what has gone wrong and learn lessons for the future. The inquiry operates independently of government and, within its terms of reference, decides for itself what it investigates”, the spokesperson added.

‘Conspiracy of Silence’: The British towns where underage girls were raped by Muslim grooming gangs for decades https://t.co/uHVBTdmhPT — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 12, 2017

Earlier this month Breitbart London reported that 16 men of South Asian descent, including a police officer, were charged in connection to grooming crimes allegedly committed against three teenage girls in Halifax, England.

The following day an additional four men of South Asian-origin were convicted of sexually exploiting children during the early 2000s in Telford, England.

In 2018, then Home Secretary, Sajid Javid launched an inquiry into the ethnic origins of members of grooming gangs in the UK. Speaking to the BBC in December, Javid determined that the majority of perpetrators were of Pakistani origin.

“When it comes to gang-based child exploitation it is self-evident to anyone who cares to look that if you look at all the recent high-profile cases there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, Javid said.

“There could be – I’m not saying that there are – there could be some cultural reasons from the communities that these men came from that could lead to this kind of behaviour”, he added.

3480,a87840e6cb2d928be42e621efd1ad9d0,"An anonymous Taliban official told the Associated Press on Monday that the terrorist group had agreed to a “peace deal” that would result in the release of 5,000 jihadists. The next day, an official Taliban spokesman denied that they were close to signing any deal with the government of Afghanistan.

The Taliban considers itself the only government of Afghanistan, and has for years refused to engage in negotiations with the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Its leadership has also repeatedly insisted that it will not stop executing terrorist attacks so long as American and other outside forces remain present in the country.

Afghan outlet Khaama News reported on Monday that the AP had received confirmation from “a Taliban official familiar” with talks between the government of President Ashraf Ghani and the terrorist group that a peace deal was on the way, one that would free 5,000 Taliban jihadis currently in Afghan prison. Khaama based its report on AP claiming that the deal would create a “temporary cease-fire” meant to give time for an agreement with the United States.

“A cease-fire had been demanded by Washington before any peace agreement could be signed. A peace deal would allow the U.S. to bring home its troops from Afghanistan and end its 18-year military engagement there, America’s longest,” AP reported. It offered no confirmed details on when a ceasefire would begin, how long it would last, or how it would affect other engagements against jihadist groups active in Afghanistan, such as the Islamic State. The Islamic State has forced the Taliban to redirect some resources away from killing Americans to attack ISIS terrorists seeking to take over its opium fields.

The Associated Press added that the deal would not be viable until the head of the terrorist organization signed it, “but that was expected.”

Accompanying the report was a bizarre Associated Press profile of the Taliban jihadists in prison, which it claimed were suddenly more socially liberal and peace-loving.

“Several of them were nostalgic for the Taliban’s Afghanistan, ruled by the mighty hand of their previous leader, the reclusive Mullah Mohammed Omar, who died several years ago,” the AP said of the prisoners. “But they also insisted that they accept it would not be the same now and that, though they still wanted what they call Islamic rule, they no longer call for some of their strict edicts, like the ban on education and on girls and women working.”

The AP claimed that many of those imprisoned on grounds of being Taliban members were not actually, and that real Taliban jihadists were surprised to find many of them in prison, accused by neighbors and rivals seeking to fulfill a grudge. But even among these, some had “found comfort with the Taliban” in prison and became loyal to the group after sharing a prison with its members.

In an official press statement released later Monday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied any agreement or prisoner swap.

“For the past few days, a number of media outlets have been publishing false and baseless reports about a ceasefire by the Islamic Emirate [the Taliban],” Mujahid wrote. “The reality of the situation is that the Islamic Emirate has no intention of declaring a ceasefire. The United States has asked for a reduction in the scale and intensity of violence and discussions being held by the Islamic Emirate are revolving solely around this specific issue.”

Mujahid specifically denied that his rejection of reports published in American media and based on remarks by Taliban members suggested “differences” in the Taliban ranks.

“It is hoped that our compatriots pay no heed to the malicious reports being propagated by the enemy media,” Mujahid advised. “The Islamic Emirate will take every necessary and appropriate step that ensures the higher interests and Jihadi aspirations of our homeland in the light of Islamic Shariah in both the military and political fronts, Allah willing.”

Independently, a Taliban commander speaking to Sky News insisted not only that news of an impending ceasefire this week was false, but that no ceasefire was possible so long as American troops remained in Afghanistan.

“A ceasefire is not possible at all because, while Americans are in our country, it is occupied. They must leave fully otherwise there is no chance of a ceasefire,” he reportedly asserted. “When the American leave then there will be talks between the Afghan factions. While Americans are present here no one will talk to their slaves.”

President Donald Trump has repeatedly asserted a desire to withdraw American troops from the country, where they were deployed in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Peace talks have repeatedly collapsed, however, because the Taliban do not acknowledge the legitimacy of the Afghan government.

The past year saw the Taliban become the deadliest terrorist group in the world, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) annual Global Terrorism Index. The Taliban marked 70 percent more murders – over 6,000 total – overtaking the Islamic State, whose most active cells are now operating against the Taliban in Afghanistan.

The president doubled down in his warning toIran, saying their government will be held 'fully responsible' for the attack that forced the Pentagon to send 100 Marines as reinforcements to the Iraqi embassy.

'The U.S. Embassy inIraqis, & has been for hours, SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters, together with the most lethal military equipment in the world, was immediately rushed to the site. Thank you to the President & Prime Minister of Iraq for their rapid response upon request,' Trump tweeted Tuesday evening.

'Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!' he added.

In a third tweet he quipped 'The Anti-Bengahzi!' The post was an effort to distinguish his administration's response to that of the Obama administration in the 2012 attack on a diplomatic compound in Libya that left four Americans dead. The tweet, which had a spelling error, was deleted soon after.

In the Tuesday attack militia members with the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) swarmed the high-security compound, breaking down the main door to the compound and setting a fire in the reception area, forcing US soldiers inside the embassy to fire tear gas, stun grenades and warning shots. In the chaos 62 of the thousands of fighters were injured, according to PMF.

Ambassador to Iraq Matthew Tueller was on leave at the time of the attack and embassy staff had already been evacuated before the US Marine guard became besieged behind the bullet-proof glass and on the rooftops.

The attack on the embassy was is in retaliation for US air strikes on the Iran-backed Kataeb Hezbollah on Sunday night, which killed two dozen fighters. Those strikes were in retaliation for last week's killing of an American contractor at a US base in Kirkuk.

On Tuesday US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US was sending additional forces to the Baghdad embassy, while calling on Iraq to help protect American personnel, hours after President Donald Trump slammed the attack and warned that Iran will be 'held fully responsible'.

Video footage from the scene shows the US military sending in Marines from Kuwait in two Army Aviation UH-60M utility helicopters and two CH-47F Chinook helicopters, which were then used to evacuate embassy personnel. Another clip shows a US Apache helicopter dropping warning flares above the embassy.

'We have taken appropriate force protection actions to ensure the safety of American citizens, military personnel and diplomats in country, and to ensure our right of self-defense,' Esper said in a statement, according to AP.

'As in all countries, we rely on host nation forces to assist in the protection of our personnel in country, and we call on the Government of Iraq to fulfill its international responsibilities to do so,' he added.

An AH-64E Guardian attack helicopter was also seen flying over the embassy ready to open fire in case any Kataeb Hezbollah members attacked the incoming Marines.

The deployed Marines are reportedly from Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Central Command, a ground force deployed to the Middle East that specializes in crisis response, U.S. officials confirmed toMilitary.com. That force was created after the 2012 attack on the diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans.

On Tuesday morning Trump condemned the attack on the US embassy and pointed the blame to Iran.

'Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will.' Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning. 'Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!'

'To those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don’t want to be dominated and controlled by Iran, this is your time!' the president added.

The attack on Tuesday unfolded after thousands attended the funerals of the Iran-backed Kataeb Hezbollah fighters killed in the American airstrikes on Sunday. After the processions, mourners and protesters rushed through the heavily fortified Green Zone without being stopped by Iraqi military as they burned U.S. flags and changed 'Death to America! on their way to the consulate.

There were roughly 6,000 protesters at the height of the demonstrations, a U.S. official estimated, most hailing from Kataeb Hezbollah, also known as Hashd al-Shaabi.

US fighter jets bombarded three locations in Iraq on Sunday night, in retaliation for last week's 36-rocket attack which killed an American contractor and injured several others at a base in Kirkuk, 170 miles north of Baghdad.

On Sunday the US struck a total of five Kataeb Hezbollah controlled weapon depots in Iraq and Syria, killing at least 25 people and wounding 51.

Baghdad had warned the American government that relations with the US were at risk following the airstrikes. There are also concerns over whether Iraqi forces allowed protesters to reach the Embassy, located in a usually restricted area.

The US attack - the largest targeting an Iraqi state-sanctioned militia in recent years - and the calls for retaliation represent a new escalation in the proxy war between the US and Iran playing out in Iraq.

Kataeb Hezbollah, which is separate but linked to the Lebanese Hezbollah, operates under the umbrella of the state-sanctioned predominantly Shiite militias known collectively as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Many are supported by Iran.

The US says Kataeb Hezbollah is responsible for 11 attacks on US-led coalition bases in the past two months.

It was the first time in years that protesters have been able to reach the US embassy in Baghdad, the nation's largest embassy which spans 104 acres.

The embassy, located in Baghdad's Green Zone, has been placed on lockdown.

Who is the mob storming the embassy?

The mob are supporters or members of Kataeb Hezbollah, which is separate but linked to the Lebanese Hezbollah, and operates under the umbrella of the Iraqi government sanctioned umbrella of militias known collectively as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF).

Many of the groups, but particularly Kataeb Hezbollah, are backed by Iran.

Kataeb Hezbollah has for months been firing rockets and mortars at US forces throughout Iraq.

It actively stockpiles and smuggles Iranian-made weapons into Iraq.

The terror group has in the past received weapons from the Palestinian Hezbollah, which is also a key ally of Iran.

Hundreds of the yellow flags of the terror group were seen among the masses on Tuesday.

US Security guards were seen retreating inside the embassy early Tuesday as protesters hurled bottles and smashed security cameras outside the buildings.

Flames rose from the compound as furious rioters pressed up against the bullet-proof windows within the complex, taunting the US soldiers within and spraying pro-Hezbollah graffiti over the glass.

Half a dozen US Marine guards fired warning shots from the rooftops, followed by tear gas and stun grenades, at rioters who set blazes and smashed up barricades on the ground.

Hundreds of angry protesters, many in military fatigues, set up tents outside the embassy and set fire to trailers used by security guards along the embassy wall.

Many were seen carrying posters that read, 'Parliament should oust US troops, or else we will'. Some carried banners with Trump's face crossed out.

Some protesters carried what they said were the coffins of the fighters killed in the American airstrikes. Many were heard chanting 'America, leave, leave!' as perNPR.

Sixty-two people have been reported injured in the carnage by the PMF.

A spokesman for Kataeb Hizbollah said they intend to stake out the street in front of the embassy to push US officials to leave Iraq. 'We will not leave these tents until the embassy and the ambassador leave Iraq,' Mohammed Muhi said, according to the Times.

The US State Department disputed reports of a breach and said all US personnel are safe.

'US personnel are secure and there has been no breach. There are no plans to evacuate Embassy Baghdad,' a State Department spokesperson tells DailyMail.com. 'The US Ambassador to Iraq, Matt Tueller, has been on previously scheduled personal travel for over a week and reports that he has been evacuated are false. He is returning to the Embassy.'

A man on a loudspeaker urged the mob not to enter the compound, saying: 'The message was delivered.'

Later protesters were led by a cleric in prayer, kneeling within the walls of the still-occupied compound, though in an apparently more peaceful demonstration.

Jarringvideofootage from the scene shows a militia man in a military fatigue pledging to burn down the embassy.

'This is a letter to Trump and the American embassy in Baghdad and its consulate in Erbil and in Basra...those who have attacked our forces and our Jihadi brothers, God willing, if this fire reaches the inside of the embassy, we will not spare a single employee. We are the children of martyrs and this is our statement. Death to America.'

An Iraqi employee at the embassy told the AP that the embassy's security team had evacuated some local staff from a rear gate while others left by helicopter as the rest remained inside 'safe' areas within the embassy.

Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi pleaded with the mob against any aggression towards foreign embassies and representations in Baghdad, asking protesters outside the U.S. embassy to leave 'immediately.'

As of Tuesday evening, most of the protesters had dispersed, but many were still outside the embassy in chairs and tents for a sit-in demonstration, challenging US presence in the country and the airstrikes.

In the wake of the attack, President Trump has received regular updates from his national security team while spending the holiday week at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. 'It will be the president’s choice how and when we respond to their escalation,' White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi and President Barham Salih separately by phone from his office in Washington, DC on Tuesday, according to The Hill.

'The secretary made clear the United States will protect and defend its people, who are there to support a sovereign and independent Iraq. Both Abdul-Mahdi and Salih assured the secretary that they took seriously their responsibility for and would guarantee the safety and security of U.S. personnel and property,' a Pompeo spokesperson said.

However, as the news of the embassy riot made headlines, the Iraqi National Security Council released a statement ignoring them and instead condemning the US airstrikes.

Attack comes seven years after US ambassador was killed in Benghazi attack

On September 11, 2012, Islamic militant group Ansar al-Sharia launched a planned attack on US government facilities in Benghazi, Libya.

The night time raid killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith.

Stevens was the first US ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since 1979.

At 4pm the following day, the militants fired mortars at the CIA annex around a mile away, killing CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and wounding ten others.

Initial analysis found that the attack arose from a protest.

But later investigations showed it had been premeditated, although rioters and looters had played an initial role in the chaos.

The attack was highly controversial due to accusations that the Obama administration had allowed for security lapses.

As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton later accepted responsibility for security failings following a high level State Department resignation and suspensions of long-standing officials.

'We recall that any aggression or harassment of foreign embassies will be firmly prohibited by the security forces,' Abdel Mahdi's office said several hours after the attack began.

The Iraqi government had earlier announced three days of mourning for the 25 fighters killed in the US strikes.

The United States has around 5,200 troops deployed across Iraq to train security forces and prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State jihadist group.

On Sunday night, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said the strikes send the message that the U.S. will not tolerate actions by Iran that jeopardize American lives.

The Iranian-backed Iraqi militia had vowed Monday to retaliate for the U.S. military strikes in Iraq and Syria that killed 25 of its fighters and wounded dozens.

The attack and vows for revenge raised concerns of new attacks that could threaten American interests in the region.

Kataeb Hezbollah and similar Iran-backed militias play a complicated role in Iraq. The paramilitary has fought against ISIS and is a part of Iraq’s security forces. However, the U.S. has questioned whether the Iraqi government actually has control over it and other Iran-backed groups.

The U.S. attack outraged both the militias and the Iraqi government which said it will reconsider its relationship with the U.S.-led coalition - the first time it has said it will do so since an agreement was struck to keep some U.S. troops in the country.

It called the attack a 'flagrant violation' of its sovereignty.

In a partly televised meeting Monday, Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi told Cabinet members that he had tried to stop the U.S. operation 'but there was insistence' from American officials.

Searing aerial footage was released on Monday of US F-15 Strike Eagles wreaking havoc on Kataeb Hezbollah.

Iran condemned the attack as 'terrorism' while Kataib Hezbollah commander Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes said: 'The blood of the martyrs will not be in vain and our response will be very tough on the American forces in Iraq.'

Meanwhile the Iraqi military spokesman for outgoing Prime Minister Abel Abdel Mahdi rebuked the US for its intervention, General Abdul Kareem Khalaf said: 'We consider it a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and a dangerous escalation that will threaten Iraq and the region.'

The US said it had taken the 'necessary' overnight action to protect its personnel in the region following an attack two days earlier that killed a US civilian contractor and injured four US service members near Kirkuk.

'The Department of Defense took offensive actions in defense of our personnel interests in Iraq', Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.

Another spokesman for the Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq, Sayyed Jaafar Al-Husseini, said: 'Options are kept open as we are waiting for the leadership's decision in this regard. There will certainly be an appropriate retaliation.

'The Americans had tested before the Iraqi resistance strikes, and our capabilities are now duplicated.'

Jewad Kadum, a PMF official, said in a statement that rescue operations were ongoing as well as the evacuation of the wounded, recovery of the dead bodies and the extinguishing of the fire caused by the airstrikes.

The locations included weapons storage facilities and command and control locations the group had used to plan and execute attacks on coalition forces, the Pentagon said during an earlier announcement.

Esper, appearing with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, said the retaliatory air strikes on Sunday were 'successful' and that all pilots and aircraft involved returned safely.

Iraqi security sources said on Monday that U.S. forces in Iraq's northerly Nineveh province were ramping up security overnight, with U.S.-led coalition jets circling the perimeter of its military bases in Mosul and Qayarah.

The United States had accused the group of a 30-plus rocket attack on Friday that killed the US civilian contractor and injured four US service members and two members of the Iraqi Security Forces near the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.

Pompeo at the news conference said attacks have been going on for 'weeks and weeks weeks'.

The fatal incident was 'the eleventh rocket attack targeting an outpost housing American forces in the last two months,' according to Military Times.

'Today what we did is take a decisive response that makes clear what President Trump has said for months and months and months, which is that we will not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and women in jeopardy,' Pompeo said at the news conference.

Earlier this month, a senior US military official revealed that attacks by Iranian-backed groups on bases hosting US forces in Iraq were gathering pace and becoming more sophisticated.

The US has sent nearly 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East within the past six months in response to escalating tensions with Iran.

President Trump has not yet responded to Friday's attack, and Iraqi Security Forces are leading the response and investigation.

The Pentagon contractor who was killed has not yet been publicly named. All injured US troops are expected to make a full recovery.

Since the weekend strikes, ties have been increasingly strained.

Iraq's government, acting in a caretaker capacity after Abdel Mahdi resigned in the face of street protests, threatened to summon the US ambassador.

'American forces acted on their political priorities, not those of Iraqis,' it said.

Dozens of lawmakers called on the government to review an agreement allowing the deployment of US soldiers in the country, saying the strikes amount to a violation of sovereignty that renders the pact obsolete.

The United States, meanwhile, accused Iraq of failing to 'protect' US interests in the country.

US defence officials have told AFP that pro-Iran factions now pose a greater threat than IS because of the repeated rocket attacks.

Abdel Mahdi said he had been forewarned by Defence Secretary Mark Esper that the US would carry out the strikes.

'He told me the United States would strike the Hezbollah Brigades and I told him it would be a very dangerous act that could lead to an escalation,' Abdel Mahdi said.

The premier tendered his resignation in November after two months of anti-government rallies.

'This may well be the low point of US policy in Iraq,' said Iraq expert Fanar Haddad of Singapore University's Middle East Institute.

'That the national security adviser, MPs, a former minister and head of one of the most powerful parliamentary blocs are involved speaks volumes about the failure of US policy and the nature of the Iraqi state they helped create,' Haddad said.

3497,2728b0220cd0beeec8bf36d0df73c3b7,"MSNBC host Joe Scarborough published an op-ed in the Washington Post on Monday evening in which he drew lessons from Hitler’s rise in Nazi Germany to urge voters not to re-elect the “illiberal” President Donald Trump.

Aware of the absurdity of the Nazi comparison, Scarborough said that it should not be made “directly,” and noted that the United States does not have death camps like Auschwitz. But he warned that the horrors of the Nazis were not immediately apparent to Germans, either. He described Trump as an “illiberal” president — such as those who govern in Russia, China, or Turkey — though he provided no evidence except familiar complaints about rhetoric.

Scarborough wrote:

One should never compare Trump’s rise directly to that of German fascism, and still there are lessons that can be drawn from every era. Sebastian Haffner’s 1939 memoir “Defying Hitler” spoke of influencers who initially dismissed the Nazi party for its “violent stupidity,” much like Trump’s critics mocked the reality star’s candidacy with a chuckle. The “Saturday Night Live” skit with Hillary Clinton laughing at her good fortune for drawing Trump as a political opponent comes to mind. “I was inclined not to take them very seriously,” Haffner wrote in 1939, “a common attitude among their inexperienced opponents, which helped them a lot.” The German journalist and lawyer observed that while the “vilest abuse” could be directed toward Jews, “the process of the law was not changed at all.” A cursory review of Auschwitz or Dachau’s history reveals how the evil of Hitler’s reign does not remotely compare to the current state of U.S. politics. The cost of illiberalism’s spread in the age of Trump may be better understood by studying the erosion of democratic norms in Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey or Viktor Orban’s Hungary, or the further strengthening of China and Russia’s autocratic regimes. But we should still remain mindful that the failure of Germany’s political, financial and media elites to serve as a bulwark against the illiberal impulses that seized that countrythen mirrors the failure of American leaders initially to grasp the consequences of Donald J. Trump. Three years later, the question remains of how best to respond to that threat.

Scarborough cited, approvingly, a New York Times op-ed by retired Admiral William McRaven in October in which he urged that Trump be removed from office “the sooner, the better.” Notably, Scarborough did not mention Trump’s impeachment, which still hangs in the air after the House refused to deliver articles of impeachment to the Senate.

Scarborough’s article came in the wake of a string of violent antisemitic attacks in New York and New Jersey.

3506,dfefad3580bb225314e66c7be50608eb,"SEOUL, Dec. 30 (UPI) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for “offensive political, diplomatic and military countermeasures” in order to safeguard the country during a meeting of the ruling Worker’s Party, state media reported Tuesday.

The comments came ahead of an end-of-year deadline that Pyongyang has imposed for Washington to come up with a new proposal in its nuclear negotiations, threatening a “new way” forward if its conditions are not met.

Kim advised party members to prepare “positive and offensive political, diplomatic and military countermeasures for firmly preserving the sovereignty and security of the country, intensifying the combat against anti-socialist and non-socialist acts,” the North’s Korean Central News Agency reported.

Kim made the remarks Monday, the third day of a plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party, according to KCNA. He also presented a seven-hour status report on “state building, economic development and building of the armed forces” at the meeting and called for the ruling party to turn into “a militant party full of vitality and vigor.”

The North Korean leader is scheduled to deliver his annual New Year’s Day address Wednesday, an event that many observers will be watching closely for signs of a policy shift toward a more confrontational stance with the United States and South Korea.

Talks with Washington have been at an impasse since a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi, Vietnam, ended abruptly without an agreement. Both sides remain apart on issues such as easing international sanctions that have been imposed on North Korea and on a timetable for proceeding with denuclearization.

The most recent working-level talks were held in October in Sweden, but little progress was made as North Korea accused the United States of coming to the table “empty-handed.”

Pyongyang resumed weapons tests throughout the latter half of 2019, launching several short-range ballistic missiles, including its first submarine-launched missile and a version of the highly maneuverable Russian Iskander.

Earlier this month, the North carried out a pair of what it called “crucial” tests at its Sohae Satellite Launching Station, which analysts suggested could be a long-range rocket engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. It also warned that it would be up to the Trump administration to determine “what Christmas gift it will select to get.”

Christmas Day passed without any new provocations, but tensions remain high on the Korean Peninsula, and Washington and Seoul are on alert.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the United States is watching North Korea “very closely” and is hoping that it will choose a peaceful course going forward.

“We’re watching what they’re doing here in the closing days of this year, and we hope that they’ll make a decision that will lead to a path of peace and not one toward confrontation,” Pompeo said during an appearance on Fox News.

The director, who deemed the “human race” the “biggest loser” following Trump’s historic victory in 2016, has been chummy with Vermont’s socialist senator for years.

McKay used his 2016 Oscars acceptance speech to warn voters against supporting “big banks, oil, or weirdo billionaires” — words which resonated with Sanders. He reportedly “highlighted McKay’s comment” during a 2016 rally in Milton, Massachusetts.

Sanders also praised the Hollywood director’s Oscar-winning film The Big Short.

“Excellent film,” Sanders said. “My wife and I, we used to go to movies a lot. Last eight months we have gone twice. One of the films that we did see is The Big Short.”

The lovefest continued the following year, with Adam McKay praising Sanders during a 2017 interview with the Daily Beast.

“I loved that [Bernie] doesn’t take money from big banks, oil companies, or billionaires,” McKay said. “I was so sick of our politicians getting paid by these huge, moneyed interests.”

""The surprising audacity of American officials is so much that after killing at least 25... and violating the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, that now... they attribute the Iraqi people's protest against their cruel acts to the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi.

His statement came after US President Donald Trump accused Iran of killing an American civilian contractor and ""orchestrating"" the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad earlier on Tuesday.

Mousavi said the claim was an insult to the people of Iraq.

In response to rocket attacks that killed the contractor in northern Iraq, the US launched air strikes Sunday on an Iran-backed militant group that killed 25 people in western Iraq.

""The Americans ignore the Iraqi nation's liberty and drive for independence on one hand, and on the other forget their own role in supporting Saddam and Daesh,"" Mousavi said, referring to former dictator Saddam Hussein and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group.

SEPANG, Jan 1 ― A total of 299 air travellers got to experience Malaysian hospitality first-hand today in conjunction with the Visit Malaysia 2020 (VM2020) campaign, when they were treated to a grand reception at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) this morning.

Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Mohamaddin Ketapi, who was present at the reception, expressed hope that all Malaysians would work together towards the success of VM2020.

“Whether state or federal level, we hope everyone will work together towards this national mission,” he said briefly to reporters here.

Yesterday, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad officially launched VMY2020 and said the government is targeting to achieve 30 million international tourists and RM100 billion revenue in the tourism sector through the campaign.

This morning, the 299 passengers ― including tourists and Malaysians ― on board an Etihad Airways flight from Abu Dhabi were presented with special tokens that represent Malaysia and draped with a special VM2020 sash as they were greeted by Mohamaddin and Tourism Malaysia staff at their arrival gate.

Apart from the special tokens, the passengers were also treated to traditional dance and music performances.

Besides KLIA, similar receptions were also held concurrently at 22 entry points throughout the country.

This is the fifth edition of Visit Malaysia Year, this time with the theme “Visit Truly Asia Malaysia 2020” which used a logo inspired by Malaysian batik which highlighted various national icons such as the hornbill, hibiscus, wild ferns and the colours of the national flag.

The Visit Malaysia Year campaign was first held in 1990 with the theme “Fascinating Malaysia” followed by the second edition in 1994 themed “Fascinating Malaysia ― Naturally More” and the third edition in 2007 themed “Celebrating 50 Years of Nationhood” while the fourth was launched in 2014 with the slogan “Celebrating 1Malaysia Truly Asia”.

This whole ordeal began back in July with Gov. Kevin Stitt sent out a letter to tribal leaders wanting to renegotiate the percentage of casino earnings the tribes pay back to the state as part of their Exclusivity Agreement.

The saga has now become a legal battle about the wording of the 15-year gaming compact that Governor Stitt says expires tonight.

The tribes say differently.

“We feel the language in the compact says it automatically renews and that’s how we are going to treat it on January 1,” said Governor Reggie Wassana of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes.

Other tribal leaders taking that sentiment a step further.

The Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes filed a federal suit today against Governor Stitt.

They are asking a judge to decide whether the compact automatically renews if a new deal is not worked out.

Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby saying in part,

“While we prefer negotiation to litigation, the Federal court is now the only reasonable alternative to bring legal certainty to this issue.”

Click here to read the full statement.

Governor Stitt issued a statement on Tuesday saying two tribes have signed the 8-month compact extension he proposed earlier this month, but those two tribes do not have gaming in Oklahoma.

In regards to the lawsuit, the governor said in part,

“I am disappointed that a number of Oklahoma tribes, led by the Chickasaw, Cherokee, and Choctaw Nations, did not accept the State’s offer on Oct. 28 for a three-panel arbitration to resolve our dispute outside of court. This was a capstone action to their numerous refusals to meet with State and begin negotiations on the Model Gaming Compact to ensure a win-win for all parties by the end of this year. I was elected to represent all 4 million Oklahomans, and I will continue to be laser-focused on an outcome that achieves a fair deal and is in the best interest of the state and its citizens.”

But some tribal leaders disagree. They say they were not approached by Gov. Stitt in good faith.

“I haven’t seen him at any of our meetings that we have had and it would have been good if he would have walked thru the door and said this is what I want to do. What can you do? When you are treated like a 3rd class citizen, when you are disrespected, you are almost dehumanized, what is the tribe supposed to do?” said Wassana.

Tribal leaders expect casino gaming to continue as normal on the first day of 2020.

Governor Stitt has said he plans to do a state audit of Tribal Casinos.

3766,9eca911345dc82bdab6c9a189c6b1f91,"If you’ve been reading this site for very long, then you know that Virginia’s counties and cities have voted to become gun sanctuaries ahead of legislation which has been prefiled to make Virginia a gun grabber’s paradise.

What you may not know is that a number of other states besides Virginia have cities and counties which have enacted gun sanctuaries (and there is likely to be more). In fact, including Virginia, there are currently nine states to jump on the gun sanctuary bandwagon (hat tip to here for the lead). Paul Bedard writes,

“I did not think it would be that high of a number,” said sanctuary advocate and Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins.

“It’s an organic thing that just took off after Election Day. Elections have consequences, and this is the result. This has truly rocked the conservative, libertarian group’s core. It has really shook a lot of them awake. They are fully awake,” he told Secrets.

Remarkably, the effort has not seen a big push from the National Rifle Association. Local groups, notably the Virginia Citizens Defense League,have led the campaign that has brought thousands of gun-rights advocates to county board meetings.

It has also become the national model for the movement that has now reached Illinois, Washington, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, New Jersey, Florida, and Tennessee. Illinois is credited with starting the movement.

“What’s happening is Virginia is becoming a national story and model,” said Cam Edwards, editor of Bearing Arms and a national authority on gun laws.

Late Monday, three counties in Virginia — Stafford, Prince Edward, and York — and the town of Vinton joined the effort.

The language adopted in the movement uses words such as “Second Amendment Sanctuary” and “constitutional,” and signals that police will not enforce anti-gun laws. Proposals before the Virginia legislature include gun bans, gun registration, expanded background checks, and limits on the size of magazines that hold cartridges.

Proponents warn, however, that the resolutions do not provide legal protection against gun control measures.

Jenkins said that Richmond should instead enforce laws already on the books to target criminals, not those who use their weapons legally.

“It’s all part of an agenda to further take away firearms, restrict and register weapons, and there is no need for it. There are enough laws already in place on weapon restrictions. We need no new laws. We need to focus on the ones we have,” he said.

He and Edwards said that the movement is the latest evidence of the urban-rural divide.

“It’s not the NRA, as everyone might expect,” said Jenkins, who has proposed deputizing gun owners to protect their weapons from any gun grab.

Instead, he added, it is a movement of people who feel their culture and way of life are under attack.

“They are the ones you don’t hear from. They’re not going to speak out at the board meetings or polling places and write editorials. They’re the everyday man who is focused on raising a family, going to work, and trying to live a good life and be a good citizen, and they see this as people who have no knowledge of what they’re family means when it comes to protection or the bearing of arms, nor can they relate to their culture of hunting or sport shooting or anything about them, and yet they want to come from their urban areas … and they drive to Richmond, where they want to implement these laws where the vast amount of Virginia is going to be affected by it even though they have not done anything wrong,” he said."," Threaten, not specified below",3

3981,9dc7421e90122657bc88e420fe0704fc,"The government and the Attorney-general on Tuesday said they were not in favour of intervening in cases heard before the Republic’s courts following the backlash over the Ayia Napa rape case.

Government Spokesman Kyriacos Koushios said the government has full confidence in the judiciary and the courts of the Republic while Attorney-general Costas Clerides argued that any intervention by him would be an obstacle to the establishment of the facts and intervene in judiciary work.

The statements come after reaction to a Paralimni court ruling on Monday that found a 19-year-old British woman guilty of public mischief for lying about being gang raped by 12 Israeli tourists in Ayia Napa in July.

The Republic of Cyprus “has constitutionally regulated institutions and a separation of powers,” Koushios said in a written statement.

In this context, he said the government does not intervene in cases heard by the competent courts of the Republic of Cyprus, nor does it comment on positions or allegations raised in cases pending before the courts.

“The government has full confidence in the judiciary and the courts of the Republic of Cyprus, which should be strictly left to enforce the laws of the state and to administer justice,” he said.

On Monday, a spokesman for Britain’s Foreign Office said the UK government was “seriously concerned about the fair trial guarantees” in the “deeply distressing case” of the 19-year-old. The Foreign Office said it will be raising the issue with the Cypriot authorities.

The woman was convicted of a single count of public mischief by the Famagusta District Court in Paralimni after judge Michalis Papathanasiou said prosecutors had proved her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. She is to be sentenced on January 7 where she faces up to a year in jail and a €1,700 fine.

Clerides too, following reactions by local legal circles arguing that the AG ought to have interrupted the criminal prosecution against the 19-year-old, said that intervention by him “either for reasons of public interest or for other reasons, would be nothing more than an obstacle to the establishment of the facts.”

He defended the way the case was handled, arguing that since the defendant had made serious allegations against the investigating authorities of the Republic of Cyprus, which concerned the issue of whether her deposition was willingly given, these claims should not be left hanging through the suspension of the criminal prosecution but should be decided by the court. “And it did,” Clerides said.

He added that since the defendant “has raised and continues to raise a matter of non-fair trial, this too is a purely legal-constitutional matter which must be raised and decided by the court.”

According to daily Politis, the AG was called by two of his predecessors, Alecos Markides and Petros Clerides, in addition to former justice minister, lawyer Kypros Chrysostomides, to stop the criminal proceedings for reasons of public interest since the case had triggered an international outcry against Cyprus.

Clerides dismissed their request arguing that the outcry was not due to the decision to prosecute the young woman, but the accusations made by her against the law enforcement authorities.

The 19-year-old’s defence team said it is to appeal to the Supreme Court and will go all the way to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.

Nikoletta Charalambidou, one of the teen’s lawyers, said that they will appeal after the sentencing is heard on January 7.

Charalambidou told the Cyprus News Agency that her client’s rights had been violated during the interrogation stage since it took place without a lawyer, while her right to a fair trial was also violated.

The 19-year-old, according to the lawyer, entered the police station as a victim reporting her rape and exited as a suspect for another offence.

The message sent by the state to women who are victims of rape or violence in general is that they better not report it because they might find themselves accused, the lawyer told CNA.

The ruling was not met well internationally, prompting the creation of a #BoycottCyprus hashtag on social media and a petition to drop all charges against the young woman.

Head of the Cyprus Bar Association Doros Ioannides said court decisions should not be questioned that way.

He added that in the case there is an appeal the court of appeal will rule if the Paralimni court’s decision was the right one or not.

Ioannides however, said he too would have liked to see the interruption of the criminal prosecution against the 19-year-old “due to that she was repeatedly tried by the media for an offence which, basically, has been abolished in many countries.”

He also said that such a thing would “in no way” be considered as interfering in the procedure.

At about 9:30 a.m. Monday, police say Carter found Liggins with stab wounds in a home in the 6900 block of northeast Houston. Her cousin, who was also stabbed, lay near her.

Carter told KPRC 2 that Liggins was a proud, disabled U.S. Army veteran and mother. He said she had invited her son to stay with the couple over the holidays. Carter says Liggins’ son is now missing, as is her car. Carter also said Liggins’ son is a person of interest in the double homicide.

Police announced Tuesday morning that a “male relative” of the victims may have been with the women when they died. They called this unnamed relative a person of interest in the investigation.

“We don’t know what his role is as far as him being a witness, he’s witness right now, we want to speak with him, talk with him right now and hopefully he can help with this investigation”, said Houston police homicide Detective Nina Sharp, Tuesday.

Police believe the person of interest is driving a silver, 2017 Toyota Camry, with the Texas license number LWH-3931.

3985,a6aafaf798a4b061ee0c32ec66db99d2,"Procedural law is fundamental to the enforcement of legal rights. Without procedural laws legal rights will remain a paper tiger. Access to justice is key in ensuring the right to equality before the law. Right to file a suit is fundamental to access to justice.

A recent news in Kuensel read: “there is a lack of uniformity in courts, as some courts in the country accepted cases without having to bring other party ‘in person’ while registering the case and conducting the miscellaneous hearing”. If the reports are true, the denial of filing a suit for failure to bring the other party by the aggrieved party will inevitably impede access to justice.

The Article 7(15) of the Constitution gives the right to “equality before the law” and Article 21(1) mandates the judiciary to “safeguard, uphold, and administer justice fairly and independently without undue delay in accordance with the rule of law to inspire trust and confidence and to enhance access to Justice”. Sections 116, 117, 118 and 31.2 of Civil and Criminal Procedure Code (CCPC) provide the right to file a suit in good faith if there is a “concrete case or controversy” (legal standing—locus standi). S.32 empowers the court to determine whether there is a legal standing, and if there is, the court is required to register the case.

In the current practice, the courts must have taken such measures with best intentions in the interest of the justice of other party. However, CCPC does not mandate such duty on the petitioner. One of the immediate demerits of such decision is indefinite delay in ensuring justice to the plaintiff.

Contrary to views in the news, rights of the other party are well incorporated in CCPC itself. For example, S. 128 empowers the court to issue summon orders by way of services of process and S.129 requires that reasonable notice and opportunity are ensured to the other party before a court takes any decision. The other party gets 21 days to respond after receiving the summon order. Further, S.38 empowers courts to tender the summon order even to the family members of the other party or any other person living with the other party or in the same dwelling. S. 38.2 authorise the courts to make written proclamation in any media, including electronic. The courts also have the authority to order the police to produce the defaulting party before the court and invoke contempt of court if necessary.

The existence of such mechanisms will, on the one hand, discourage people with genuine cases from approaching the courts and, on the other hand, other parties may use it as a tool to refrain from getting sued by changing addresses. Further, such inconsistent and non-uniformity of procedures in different courts could result in “weakening the justice delivery system but also pose a threat to the rule of law” and people’s confidence in the judiciary in the long term”.

Therefore, courts must take cognizance of His Majesty’s address during the historic 112th National Day celebrations. Legal reform must be the first step to the path of development. Maintaining consistency and uniformity in procedure would help improve public trust and confidence in the judiciary, ensure fair and expeditious hearing, and prevent undue delay in the justice system.

When the clock strikes midnight and 2020 begins, Massachusetts residents will receive an income tax cut that has been two decades in the making. On New Year’s Day, Massachusetts’ state income tax rate will drop from 5.05% to 5.0% as part of a tax cut that was approved by voters in the same election in which George W. Bush defeated Al Gore. Better late, so the saying goes, than never.

In the November 2000 general election, nearly 60% of Bay State voters approved Question 4, a ballot measure that asked voters whether they wanted to cut the commonwealth’s flat income tax rate from 5.9%, where the rate stood in 2000, to 5.0% by 2003.

In 2002, in a grab for more taxpayer revenue, the Massachusetts Legislature passed a bill to significantly delay Question 4’s rate reduction to 5.0%. That 2002 bill, House Bill 5250, replaced Question 4’s rate reduction schedule with a more gradual decrease tied to revenue triggers.

That 2002 income tax cut delay bill enacted by Massachusetts lawmakers called for the commonwealth’s income tax rate to drop by 0.05% every fiscal year that specified revenue benchmarks were met, until the rate reached 5.0%. That last 0.05% rate reduction will be enacted when the ball drops and 2020 begins, nearly two decades after voters approved the ballot measure that called for the 5.0% rate to take effect 17 years ago.

At the same time Massachusetts taxpayers are finally receiving this long overdue income tax cut, they’re also seeinging the commonwealth take a new bite out of their paychecks with the new payroll tax signed into law by Governor Charlie Baker (R) in 2018, passed as part of a “Grand Bargain” that instituted a new paid family leave entitlement and increases the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour. That payroll tax hike took effect October 2019 and is estimated to bring in $750 to $800 million each year.

This payroll tax increase is the most recent tax hike approved by Governor Baker and the Democrats who run the Massachusetts statehouse, and now they’re seeking additional tax increases in 2020. Governor Baker’s Transportation Climate Initiative, which Baker says he can impose without state lawmakers’ approval, could increase the cost of gas by approximately 17 cents per gallon.

Representative David DeCoste (R-Plymouth) has filed legislation that would require legislative sign-off in order for TCI to be implemented. Massachusetts lawmakers could take up the matter when they return to Beacon Hill later in January.

“The bottom line is we’re filing something that will at least require the Legislature to approve and maybe direct it if it’s passed,” Representative DeCoste told the Boston Herald. “It’s essentially a tax and you could have potentially never-ending tax increases as a result of this and nobody would ever vote on it.”

The Boston Globe, in the paper’s editorial endorsing the Transportation Climate Initiative (TCI), did call on TCI to be subjected to approval by state legislators. In fact, the Globe urged Massachusetts legislators to vote on TCI and an additional gas tax hike, a second one that would, unlike the revenue generated by TCI’s tax hike, allegedly be directed toward roads.

Those aren’t the only tax hikes on the table in Massachusetts right now. Bay State Democrats, who control both chambers of the state legislature, have made clear there is an interest in moving to a progressive income tax system in which increased rates are assessed on higher income levels.

Massachusetts voters have rejected efforts to move away from the current flat income tax system to a graduated structure with progressively higher rates on five separate occasions over the past forty years. This has not discouraged Senator Jason Lewis (D-Middlesex), who has spent recent years pushing a proposal to impose a progressive income tax hike in Massachusetts. Senator Lewis’s proposal would impose a 4% surtax on income above $1 million annually, on top of the existing 5.0% flat tax on all income.

For those who oppose Senator Lewis’s effort to pass a progressive income tax hike, the good news is that the threat is not immediate. Any proposal to move Massachusetts from a flat to a progressive income tax system would need to be approved by both state legislators and Massachusetts voters.

The more immediate threat of a state moving from a flat to a progressive income tax system is found in Illinois, where a measure will be on the November 2020 ballot that, if approved by voters, would do just that.

Illinois Voters Will Decide This November Whether The Land Of Lincoln Should Have A Flat Or Progressive Income Tax

The ballot measure to move Illinois to a progressive income tax system is a constitutional amendment referred to the 2020 general election ballot this past year by Governor J.B. Pritzker (D) and the Illinois House and Senate, both controlled by Democrats. The way in which this constitutional amendment would move the state away from a flat income tax is the most discussed aspect of the measure, but Illinois fiscal policy experts and political observers also believe it could pave the way for other tax hikes.

“I think this amendment would make local income taxes much more likely in Illinois,” warns Brian Costin, deputy director for Americans for Prosperity-Illinois. While local income taxes are argued to be constitutional now in Illinois, subject to approval by the General Assembly, Costin explains how the original drafting of the amendment expressly would have prohibited local income taxes, spelling out that “No government other than the State may impose a tax on or measured by income.”

The initial amendment language also limited the General Assembly to “one tax on the income of individuals and corporations.” The final version of the amendment, however, scrapped the provision banning local income taxes.

“There’s been proposals on the local level in Chicago to enact a local income tax, by progressive aldermen,” Costin explains. “I believe if the amendment passes they will say, ‘look, see we specifically eliminated the provision concerning local income taxes. This amendment was a referendum on the idea of local income taxes.’ If you like tax hikes and big government, it’s a cunning and brilliant backdoor referendum on the issue of local income taxes,” Costin adds. “Tax hikes are coming if this passes.”

The proposed progressive income tax hikes in Illinois and Massachusetts are both marketed as ways to soak the rich and make upper income households face a higher tax burden. Both proposals, while they would initially target upper incomes, would also hit thousands of small businesses that file under the individual income tax system.

As Massachusetts voters have demonstrated on five previous occasions, even blue state electorates will reject progressive tax hikes that appear on the ballot. In 2010 Washington State voters, who elected a Democrat-run state government, also rejected by nearly a two to one margin a ballot measure backed by Bill Gates Sr. that asked voters to impose a state income tax on households and small businesses earning more than $200,000 (Washington is one of seven states that does not levy a personal income tax).

2020 begins with an income tax cut in one blue flat tax state, Massachusetts. Yet the new year will close with a judgement on a flat tax in another blue state, Illinois, where already-beleaguered taxpayers face the prospect of finishing 2020 with a move to a progressive income tax system, one that imposes higher rates."," Threaten, not specified below",3

4106,111875c29483edad44f5781ed8bb5f08,"GEORGE TOWN: Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng today defended the delay in implementation of a reduced fuel price plan for the poor, saying it was necessary for further refinements.

He said despite the delay in the targeted fuel subsidy programme (PSP), which saw a backlash from the opposition, fuel prices in Malaysia remained among the lowest in the world at RM2.08 per litre.

He also noted the current crude price of US$66-US$67 per barrel, compared to US$60 last week.

“When we wanted to start the targeted fuel subsidy for the poor, the opposition did not like it.

“Now, we have delayed it for further refinements and explanation to the target group, but that too is opposed.

“So I want to ask the opposition parties, do you support fuel subsidies or not? Or are you opposing just for the sake of opposing?” he said on the sidelines of an event at Batu Maung today.

“Are they okay with the fuel price being floated (according to market rates) without taking into account the effects on the people?”

His comments follow attacks by MCA on Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail’s announcement that the Cabinet had decided to defer the PSP.

He said the government is in talks with stakeholders to further study the impact of floating fuel prices once the PSP kicks in.

Putrajaya previously said about eight million people were eligible for the programme, with three million from the lower-income group and the rest from the middle-income group.

RM2.2 billion in subsidies has reportedly been allocated for the PSP.

Earlier, Lim visited the second Penang bridge in conjunction with the reduction in toll prices today from RM8.50 to RM7, as had been announced in the 2020 Budget.

He described the exercise as a “rationalisation of tolls”, saying the lower prices would push more traffic from the first bridge to the second.

He said it would also boost growth at Batu Kawan, Penang’s new industrial township on the mainland, and the Bayan Lepas industrial zone on the island.

He also said the decision to lease new government cars would be made at the next Cabinet meeting.

It was reported that 32 Toyota Vellfires for ministers and 3,000 Honda Accords for senior officials would be leased, with Spanco Sdn Bhd, Naza, Berjaya, Sime Darby, DRB-Hicom, the Samling group, Comos and Go Auto vying for the government lease.

Spanco had leased vehicles to the government for the past 25 years. Its tenure ended in 2019.

President Donald Trump is suddenly faced on the first day of election year with hot foreign policy crises with Iran and North Korea that put American lives at risk and could weigh heavily on his own political prospects.

The US showdown with Iran rocketed to dangerous new levels after protestors burst into the US embassy compound in Iraq as US strikes on Tehran-backed militia forces killed 25 people.

Kim Jong Un meanwhile warned North Korea would soon reveal a “new strategic weapon.” If that is code for testing an intercontinental missile that could theoretically deliver a nuclear warhead to the US, his diplomatic “love affair” with Trump could soon dissolve in a dangerous new trans-Pacific standoff.

The developing challenges to the President raise the possibility that the controversial foreign policy choices that he made in the first three years of his administration could return to haunt him as he asks voters for a second term. At the very least, rising tensions will require a steady diplomatic hand and nuanced presidential leadership as he operates on a fine line of showing strength but stopping short of undue provocation.

The President’s first concern is Iran. He is now warning the Islamic Republic that any new threats to Americans or attacks on US targets could trigger an even more serious escalation than the already robust US air raids.

“Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!” Trump wrote in a tweet on Tuesday. And, speaking with reporters later Tuesday as he entered a New Year’s Eve gala at Mar-a-Lago, the President said he doesn’t want war but that if it comes to conflict, Iran wouldn’t last long.

“I don’t think that would be a good idea for Iran,” Trump said.

The administration rushed extra forces to protect the embassy, as a senior administration official told CNN the White House was “very concerned” about what might happen on Wednesday.

Yet Trump is already taking a risky victory lap on Twitter, comparing his leadership to the Obama administration after the storming of a US consulate in northeastern Libya in 2012, and presenting the results of heightened tensions with Iran as a desirable outcome.

“The Anti-Benghazi!” the President tweeted Tuesday evening. There are limited comparisons between the situations in Baghdad — where the US embassy is one of the most heavily defended buildings in the world — and the rudimentary compound used by the roving US ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the attack, in the middle of a civil war in Libya.

In many ways, the attack on the US embassy in Baghdad — which followed US strikes on the militia to avenge the death of a US contractor in the country — is an almost inevitable consequence of the Trump administration’s maximum pressure policy targeting Iran.

Critics have long warned that showy decisions related to Iran and North Korea apparently made to further Trump’s own political prospects and not a more sober evaluation of US foreign policy goals could eventually backfire.

Trump’s decision to ditch Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal — with which Tehran was complying — and to crank up sanctions has caused a debilitating economic crisis and humanitarian pain in Iran.

Washington says the nuclear deal was one of the worst agreements in history because it did not rein in Iran’s missile program or curtail what the US regards as malicious activity and support for terrorism in its neighborhood. The assumption behind Trump’s strategy is that Tehran’s clerical regime will collapse or that the Iranians will return to the negotiating table to accept a far more punitive nuclear deal.

Despite some of the most intense anti-government demonstrations in decades, many analysts believe that there is no sign the regime is falling. In fact, there is more evidence that Trump’s hardline approach is causing Iran to become more belligerent in its own region — quite the opposite of the US goal.

“While the Trump Administration has touted its maximum pressure campaign against Iran, the results so far have been more threats against international commerce, emboldened and more violent proxy attacks across the Middle East, and now, the death of an American citizen in Iraq,” New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said.

In response to the US policy, shaped by administration hardliners like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Iran has also resumed nuclear activity, even starting up centrifuges in an underground facility dismantled under the Obama-era deal.

Trump’s personal prestige on the line in Iraq

The White House says that it doesn’t want war and hopes that the fallout from the air strikes will soon cool and the crisis will pass. But if it does not, it may face the most dangerous US-Iran crisis in many years.

That’s because the prestige of Trump and the Iranians is now deeply invested in this showdown and uncertainty about erratic decision making on both sides could lead to miscalculations.

And given the hardline position of the Trump administration towards Iran, it does not seem like there is any face-saving option that could quickly limit an escalation once it starts.

The situation tugs Trump between two dueling instincts in his political soul. He loves to look tough — and live up to his own perceptions of a ruthless commander in chief.

But the President is also loath to be drawn into foreign entanglements — one of his few inviolable principles and one that takes on more importance as he runs for reelection.

In June, Trump blinked at the prospect of military action against Iran at the last minute after Tehran’s forces shot down a US drone and attacked oil tankers.

Iran may be betting that Trump will do the same again, but such a move might lead to a miscalculation if the President goes against type and could cause reprisals between the enemies that could spin out of control.

The protests at the US embassy in Baghdad raise a troubling historical parallel other than Benghazi. The storming of the US embassy by revolutionaries in Tehran and a subsequent hostage siege helped doom then-President Jimmy Carter to a single term in the 1980 election.

The political lesson from that historic humiliation is not hard to read, and it may play into Trump’s thinking on Iran in the run-up to November’s presidential election.

Still, Trump is hugely unpredictable. As the days pass after the recent upsurge in tensions the President may not draw conventional political lessons.

The embassy protests are a reminder from Iran of the huge vulnerability of US troops and diplomats in a nation where they have little leverage and where Tehran appears to be winning the battle for influence over the US — nearly 17 years after its invasion to overthrow Saddam Hussein.

In such circumstances, given his hostility to the idea of large-scale troop garrisons in the Middle East, it’s not impossible Trump could suddenly decide to yank all Americans home.

Such an option would open the President to accusations that he surrendered to Iran — though he’d be liable to spin it as a victory because it would be yet another campaign promise kept.

Iran leaned into the confrontation on Tuesday seeking to use it to solidify its advantage over Washington in Iraq.

“How and on what basis do you expect the Iraqi people to remain silent on all these crimes?” Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in a statement.

End of the love affair?

North Korea’s return to belligerence appears to reflect frustration that three face-to-face meetings between Trump and Kim, one of the world’s most reviled tyrants, have not yielded any easing of US sanctions.

But the President has much to lose if his opening to the North dissolves, since his claims to have stopped Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear tests is a centerpiece of his reelection argument.

Trump’s diplomacy has made no progress towards denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, despite concessions he offered in meeting Kim and halting US-South Korea military exercises.

In this, Trump has had about as much success as his immediate predecessors in defusing a conflict that has festered in a bitter standoff ever since the 1950-53 Korean War.

Given the personal prestige Trump has sunk into his groundbreaking summits with Kim, it’s difficult to predict how the US President might react if North Korea launches a provocative test.

A return to the President’s previous “fire and fury” rhetoric cannot be ruled out. Yet Trump has little to gain politically from an election-year showdown with Kim that exposes his wider foreign policy as a failure and revives fears of hostilities across the 38th parallel that could put tens of thousands of US troops and millions of South Korean civilians at risk.

At a meeting of ruling party officials, Kim said Tuesday that if the US “persists in its hostile policy towards the DPRK, there will never the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula.” He also announced that “the world will witness a new strategic weapon” in the near future, and in an indication that North Korea could soon resume nuclear weapon testing, said his country should no longer feel bound by its self-imposed halt on nuclear weapons and long range missile testing.

But Pompeo said on Fox News on Tuesday evening that he had seen reports of the threat but was “hopeful” that Kim “will make the right decision.”

And Trump, walking into the gala Tuesday night, remained optimistic about the future of diplomacy with the hermit nation, despite Kim’s new bellicose rhetoric. The President, touting his relationship with Kim and downplaying North Korea’s threatened “Christmas gift,” said he believes Kim is a “man of his word.”

“I hope his Christmas present is a beautiful vase,” Trump said."," Threaten, not specified below",3
4112,52f6f21e4b7e7832a40448c63ed642c9,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared an end to moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon.

Analysts said the announcement, reported by state media on Wednesday, amounted to Kim putting a missile ""to Donald Trump's head"" -- but warned that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Washington was swift to respond, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Kim to ""take a different course"" and stressing that the US wanted ""peace not confrontation"" with the North, while Trump played down the development.

Pyongyang has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests, the last of them 16 times the size of the Hiroshima blast, according to the highest estimates.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been a centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump, but little tangible progress.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's ""promise"" to him not to carry them out, and has downplayed launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February, and the North set the US an end-of-year deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a ""new way"".

""There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,"" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim as telling top ruling party officials.

""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" he added, referring to the North by its official name.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party was an indication of a major policy shift.

State television showed veteran newsreader Ri Chun Hee reading out the KCNA dispatch over footage of Kim addressing the officials and general imagery of the country.

The broadcast appeared to stand in place of Kim's usual New Year speech -- normally a key moment in the North Korean political calendar.

Kim acknowledged the impact of international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programmes, but made clear that the North was willing to pay the price to preserve its nuclear capability.

""The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,"" KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had ""conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop"" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said.

- 'Geopolitical chicken' -

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up.

""North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump's head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,"" said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

""Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,"" he added.

But the strategy was risky, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with ""more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account"".

Kim's moratorium comments were ""ominous"", said Leif-Eric Easley of Ewha University in Seoul, but added that he could be looking to ""elicit concessions by approaching Trump's red line without crossing it"".

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carries out a long-range missile test.

Speaking to Fox News and CBS after Kim's announcement, Pompeo said a resumption of nuclear and missile tests would be ""deeply disappointing"".

""We hope that Chairman Kim will take a different course... that he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,"" Pompeo said.

""We want peace, not confrontation,"" he added.

The Lagos State Fire Service on Tuesday cautioned Lagosians to be careful in handling things that could ignite fire.

Acting Head of Lagos State Fire Service Mrs. Margaret Adeseye said 70 per cent of fire outbreaks were caused by carelessness.

She spoke at the Deputy Governor’s Office in Alausa, Ikeja at the launch of this year’s Evacuation Drill Exercise for public servants.

The theme of the exercise is: “Zero tolerance for an uncontrollable fire outbreak.”

The fire service team was received by the permanent secretary in the Deputy Governor’s office.

Mrs. Adeseye said the annual exercise is geared towards acquainting civil servants with the ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ of fire safety, what to do in case of any such eventuality as well as a safe escape from hazardous environment, among others.

“The exercise will also be taken to all ministries, departments and agencies at different dates at the main and old secretariat, including the House of Assembly and other agencies of the government outside the secretariat,” she added."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The US ambassador to Iraq and other staff were evacuated from their embassy in Baghdad for their safety yesterday, Iraqi officials said, as thousands of protesters and militia fighters thronged the gates in fury at US air strikes in Iraq.

On Sunday, US planes had attacked bases belonging to an Iranian-backed militia, a move that risks drawing Iraq further into a proxy conflict between Washington and Tehran.

The attack on the Kataib Hezbollah militia was in response to the killing of a US civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base.

The two Iraqi foreign ministry officials did not say when the US ambassador or other staff had left but added that a few embassy protection staff remained.

Outside the embassy, protesters threw stones at the gate while others chanted, ""No, no, America! ... No, no, Trump!"" Iraqi special forces were deployed around the main gate to prevent them entering the embassy.

US-trained Iraqi counter-terrorism forces were later dispatched to reinforce these units.

A few hours into the protest, tear gas was fired in an attempt to disperse the crowd and some of the militias encouraged protesters through loudspeakers to leave.

""We have delivered our message, please leave the area to avoid bloodshed,"" said one announcement.

Iraqis have been taking to the streets in their thousands almost daily to condemn, among other things, militias such as Kataib Hezbollah and their Iranian patrons that support Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's government.

But yesterday, it was these militias that were spraying ""Closed in the name of the people"" on the gates of the US embassy and smashing the surveillance cameras around the building with bricks and stones. Some set up tents in preparation for a sit-in.

US senator Marco Rubio tweeted that Iran was responsible for the disorder.

Qais al-Khazali, leader of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia, and many other senior militia leaders were among the protesters.

""Americans are unwanted in Iraq. They are a source of evil and we want them to leave,"" Mr Khazali said.

The Iraqi government condemned the US attacks as a violation of the country's sovereignty and said it would review its relationship with the US. American officials said the Iraqis had failed to protect American troops and diplomats, and characterised the strikes as ""defensive"" in nature.

""We warned the Iraqi government, many times, to carry out their responsibility to protect us as their invited guests,"" said a senior State Department official.

The strikes against Kataib Hezbollah, in which 25 militia members were killed and more than 50 injured, threaten to drag Iraq further into a proxy conflict between the US and Iran.

But the outrage from Iraqis across the political spectrum, as well as threats of retaliation, also underlined the US's growing isolation in Iraq and called into question the continued viability of about 5,000 US troops in the country.

US officials said the strikes were intended to deter rocket attacks such as the one targeting a military base in Kirkuk last Friday that killed an American defence contractor and injured four US troops, the first US casualties in an intensifying series of assaults.

""This was a defensive action designed to protect American forces and American citizens in Iraq, and it was aimed also at deterring Iran,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News. ""This was an Iranian-backed rogue militia acting to deny the Iraqi people their basic sovereignty.""

The Iranian foreign ministry condemned the actions as ""a clear example of terrorism"", and a top militia leader vowed retaliation against US forces in Iraq.

The air strikes raised the stakes in the region-wide confrontation between Tehran and Washington that began after the Trump administration withdrew from a 2015 nuclear agreement and launched its ""maximum pressure"" campaign of economic sanctions against Iran. The sanctions have devastated Iran's economy and led the government to start pulling back from its commitments under the deal.

The US has responded by adding more sanctions, but the lack of a US military response apparently has given the rulers in Tehran more confidence to launch attacks targeting the US and its allies - 11 in the past two months alone.

Two weeks ago, Mr Pompeo warned Iran of a ""decisive US response"" if the regime or its militias harmed American troops or allies in the region. (© Washington Post)"," Physically assault, not specified below",3
4237,c1631cfb74b426a326ce5c74f50f1282,"BUSINESSES across the city have counted the cost of burglaries, thefts and damage in the past year.

The Argus has reported on dozens of break-ins at shops, cafes, hairdressers and other small firms in Brighton and Hove in 2019.

While many larger chain shops and businesses can afford security and insurance costs, the impact for small business owners can be devastating.

They reported suffering from sleepless nights and the fear they may even lose their business as a result of the crimes.

Those affected by burglary included Tony Bejko, Liv Mulhern and Michael Bell, who said they were living amid fears of an “epidemic” of break-ins on businesses around North Laine this autumn.

Ms Mulhern, owner of e-cigarette shop Vapertrails in Trafalgar Street, said: “There’s an atmosphere of dread, fear and insecurity.

“My shop is sandwiched between two that were targeted just days apart. I’ve had sleepless nights. A lot of people are afraid.

“It’s often a man with a push bike accompanied by another man or a woman. They’re not that sophisticated.

“If it was sophisticated they’d be clearing the shop out. Instead they tend to smash windows and doors and go straight for the till.”

Shortly before Christmas, Neoma Design shop owner Dolores Swift reported that burglars had stolen unique handbags she had created.

It left her business in Trafalgar Street, North Laine, under threat for the new year, as each piece was handmade to order.

Ms Swift said: “I was shocked, in disbelief. It made me feel that my shop is vulnerable, the neighbours said they didn’t see anything.

“I was shaking and didn’t know what to do, I’ve never had a shop broken into before.”

During the summer there was a spate of break-ins in and around Hove, including a daylight robbery at the former La Cave a Fromage in Western Road.

A shopworker was attacked by robber Ahmed Said, who admitted smashing up the shop and burgling several other businesses in the area, including nearby City Books.

The shop later closed its doors to customers, and at the time manager David Deaves said: “Over the past few weeks it has been quite a concern to businesses here. There are too many for it to be a coincidence.

“It is happening far too often, and if they are starting to do this during the day when staff are on the premises. You don’t know what will happen, they could be carrying a weapon or a knife.

“You think about the consequences it might lead to and it’s horrifying. Staff should not have to feel unsafe in their place of work.”

Said, 32, of Marine Parade, Brighton, admitted robberies and burglaries at Hove Crown Court, where he was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.

He was taking class A drugs at the time of the offences and is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

Meanwhile Muhhammed Ahmed, 35, was jailed for one year for his part in a spate of burglaries, while his girlfriend Kerry Gent was spared prison for her role helping him in one of the break-ins at Cafe Artista in Waterloo Street, Hove.

The Artista Cafe owner, who did not wish to be named, said: “As a result of the burglary I had sleepless nights. The criminals were hanging around in the area for weeks.

“I saw them and thought they might be looking to break into the cafe again. I had to stay up watching out of the window for fear of being broken into again.

“When I went out to confront them in the street, they told me they knew where I lived, there was an implied threat.”

In August, The Argus spoke with Amit Arora and Michal Zaczynski, who own hairdressers Michal in Upper North Street, Brighton.

Mr Arora said: “Why would someone do this to a person’s business?

“Our neighbour was going to work and he said there were four guys trying to break in.

“Two were standing on the other side of the road and the other two were trying to break the door.

“He shouted ‘we’re calling the police’ and then tried running after them.”

Then in September businesses in London Road, Brighton, were targeted, including the Cosy Cottage Cafe, run by Ali Parsa.

Other business owners had more success in capturing the criminals.

In November chippy boss Ramez Khalil managed to close the shutters at the Preston Fish Bar in Beaconsfield Road, trapping a would-be burglar inside before police arrived.

Detective Chief Inspector Alasdair Henry said burglary is “abhorrent” for officers, who are determined to catch the criminals.

Detective Superintendent Mike Ashcroft said police work alongside businesses to offer advice and support to cut crime.

He said: “We are working hard to reduce burglary in the city and will continue to work to protect members of our communities from this crime.

“We treat burglary as a serious matter and our prevention teams are working closely with the community to reduce the opportunities for criminals to commit these crimes.

“None of this is achieved without everyone’s support and I am grateful to all our partners, including Neighbourhood Watch and members of the community who work with us regularly to reduce burglary and bring offenders to justice.

“We have an engagement network to disseminate alerts and information around trends and individuals who may be a risk to businesses in order and support them with appropriate crime prevention activity and target hardening.

“This is done directly and in collaboration with business crime reduction partnerships and business improvement districts.

“Over the last few months we have made a number of arrests and in September a man was jailed for eight burglaries he carried out in Hove in the summer and another man is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty earlier this month to five business burglaries in Brighton and Hove.

“We all have a part to play to help keep Sussex safe and I urge residents to follow police advice and keep their property secure so that they are not a target for burglars.”

4257,2a2da3dbc2b87d36933484c77bafffcf,"CEBU CITY, Philippines – The Cebu City government will open a One-Stop-Shop processing for business permit renewal at the second floor of the SM City Cebu at the North Reclamation Area starting at 9 a.m. on Thursday, January 2, 2020.

Priority numbers will be distributed in the area from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The city’s One-Stop-Shop will only be open from Mondays to Fridays and until January 31, 2020.

Lawyer Jared Limquiaco, head of the city’s Business and Licensing Permit Office, said the One-Stop-Shop was initially scheduled to last only until January 20, but requests coming from the business sector prompted them to extend their operation at the SM Mall until the end of the month.

“Unta mo take advantage sila ani kay sa two years na ang validity sa business permit. (I hope that businesses will take advantage of this program because the validity of our business permits have already been extended to two years.) Everything they need in the processing (of their permits) will already be (made available) in the One-Stop-Shop,” Limquiaco told CDN Digital.

Those who will fail to have their business permits renewed at the city’s One-Stop-Shop will have to proceed to the City Treasurer’s Office at the Cebu City Hall for their transactions.

Limquiaco also warned them of penalties that would include the payment of late processing fees ranging from P5,ooo to P20,000 for their failure to meet the January 31 deadline.

To avoid the payment of penalties, Limquiaco is asking businessmen to visit their One-Stop-Shop that is located at the SM Mall’s second floor, the space that used to be occupied by the Visayan Electric Company (Veco).

But Real Property Tax (RPT) payments will be made in another area located at the mall’s 3rd level fronting Jollibee.

“Special lanes will be assigned for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), senior citizens and pregnant women,” says an advisory from Acting City Treasurer Juanita Monina Paires that was posted on the Cebu City Public Information Office Facebook page.

“For corporate owners who will be filing (their business permit applications) through their authorized representatives or corporate officers, (they) must present the necessary Special Power of Attorney (SPA),” Paires added.

Taxpayers are advised to fill out all the necessary forms including the Environment Sustainable Action Plan (ESAP) form which can be downloaded from www.cebucity.gov.ph. starting on Dec. 30, 2019. They are also advised to bring the other requirements to facilitate the immediate processing of their business permit renewals.

4259,a107bdb73a7e3755ae7c56a6d5bb4cae,"Rudy Giuliani dropped a bombshell on New Year’s Eve, saying he would be willing to testify in the upcoming Senate trial of President Donald Trump that could lead to his removal from office.

As The Hill reported, Giuliani spoke as he was arriving at the New Year’s Eve party at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, telling reporters that he would be willing to testify if called upon. The former New York City mayor has served as Trump’s personal attorney and was allegedly involved in the president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine into announcing an investigation of his political rival, Joe Biden.

The testimony might be a major political risk for the president. Giuliani has made a series of statements for Trump regarding the work in Ukraine that have been seen as potentially damaging. He also had been working with disgraced former Ukrainian lawmaker Andrey Artemenko on a documentary.

As The Hill noted, Giuliani is not expected to join Trump’s legal team for the upcoming trial, which has yet to take shape. Democrats are pushing for top administration officials with knowledge of his dealings on Ukraine to testify. During the House impeachment inquiry, the White House had moved to block all from testifying while also denying documents requested by congressional panels, but Democrats are hoping to compel them to testify in the Senate trial.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has given indications that he will press for a quick trial that may not include any witnesses at all. McConnell has also made it clear that he does not intend to serve as an impartial juror, as senators are called to do, and instead will work with the White House toward the president’s acquittal. Democrats have pressed back and some Republicans have indicated they are not comfortable with McConnell’s approach.

Giuliani’s testimony would be “of great interest to Democrats,” The Hill noted, as he allegedly carried out Trump’s shadow foreign policy in Ukraine. Reports indicated that his work went against the official policy and left many career diplomats frustrated.

But there is some concern even among Republicans about the work that Giuliani had been doing in Ukraine. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina senator and one of Trump’s closest allies, said in an interview with The Daily Beast that he is worried the information the presidential lawyer has been compiling on Biden during his visits to Ukraine may actually be Russian propaganda. During the impeachment hearing, some diplomats and geopolitical experts warned that the unfounded conspiracy theories Trump had been pushing on Ukraine were coming directly from the Kremlin."," Threaten, not specified below",3
4486,58a3b7d6d6526a806c473e210e5202a9,"PROVIDENCE (AP) — Rhode Island's health department is proposing to permanently ban the sale of flavored vaping products in the state.

The department issued a public notice last week that it wants to make the temporary ban currently in effect permanent. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo supports a permanent ban.

A hearing is set for Jan. 7 at the health department in Providence.

Spokesman Joseph Wendelken said Tuesday the department is acting now because the temporary ban will soon lapse, and it wants to prevent teenagers and adolescents from vaping, given the significant health concerns.

Neighboring Massachusetts last month became the first state in the country to ban the sale of all flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, e-cigarettes and e-liquids. It came after Republican Gov. Charlie Baker declared a public health emergency and imposed a temporary ban in September.

Raimondo signed an executive order in September banning the sale of flavored vaping products. In response, the health department issued emergency regulations Oct. 4 to implement a four-month ban, with an optional two-month extension.

Raimondo said this month that she wants to permanently ban flavored vaping products to protect children.

“This is an epidemic and we have to take action,” she said. “These companies are deliberately targeting addictive tobacco products to our children, resulting in kids who are 10, 11, 12 years old, addicted to tobacco products. We've got to do something. It's much more pernicious, actually, than smoking.”

Raimondo said the state shouldn't ban all vaping products because public health experts say the products may help some cigarette smokers quit.

The vaping industry has criticized bans on flavored products, calling them the wrong approach to the problem of youth vaping. The Vapor Technology Association has said that a better strategy is raising the age to purchase tobacco and nicotine vapor products to 21 and imposing stricter marketing standards on smoking companies.

The minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, was just raised from 18 to 21 nationwide. The provision to raise the legal limit was in a massive spending bill passed by Congress and signed by the president Dec. 20.

Rhode Island's health department says in its public notice it considered alternative approaches, overlap with other regulatory provisions, and the economic impact on small businesses before proposing to permanently ban the sale of flavored vaping products. It says it identified no alternative approach or overlap and found the benefits of the proposed rule justify the costs.

The department is accepting public comment until Jan. 26. It can amend the state's health regulations after going through the established process of proposing an amendment and collecting public comment."," Threaten non-force, not specified below",3
4497,6ca323e88e7a94fa6bc9085a8eaa1e35,"Officials with the Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw nations announced Tuesday they have filed a federal lawsuit against Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt regarding the tribal gaming compacts dispute.

“The suit names Gov. Stitt in his official capacity and seeks a judicial declaration that the gaming compacts renew in accord with their express terms, effective January 1, 2020,” officials said in a news release.

Tribal leaders said they provided a copy of the federal complaint to Gov. Kevin Stitt, along with a letter explaining their reasons for filing it. The counsel for the nations, former United States Circuit Judge Robert Henry, provided a companion letter and copy of the complaint to Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter.

Officials said the lawsuit calls for the court to declare the legal effect of the compact’s Part 15.B., which states, “This Compact shall have a term which will expire on January 1, 2020, and at that time, if organization licensees or others are authorized to conduct electronic gaming in any form other than parimutuel wagering on live horse racing pursuant to any governmental action of the state or court order following the effective date of this Compact, the Compact shall automatically renew for successive additional fifteen-year terms.”

The language of the compact the tribes signed with the state 15 years ago says it will expire on Jan. 1, but goes on to say it will automatically renew for 15 years at the same fee rate. The compact then says that either side can request to renegotiate the compact six months before it ends.

According to tribal leaders, all that means is Stitt can ask to negotiate but the compacts will renew at their current rate either way without a new one.

Stitt said the compacts won't automatically renew since he asked the tribes to renegotiate in July. In fact, he said the tribes' casino-style gambling will be illegal starting Wednesday.

""I am disappointed that a number of Oklahoma tribes, led by the Chickasaw, Cherokee, and Choctaw Nations, did not accept the state’s offer on Oct. 28 for a three-person arbitration panel to resolve our dispute outside of court,"" Stitt said in a news release. ""This was a capstone action to their numerous refusals to meet with state and begin negotiations on the Model Gaming Compact to ensure a win-win for all parties by the end of this year.

""I was elected to represent all 4 million Oklahomans, and I will continue to be laser focused on an outcome that achieves a fair deal and is in the best interest of the state and its citizens.""

The news release from Stitt's office also states two tribes, The Kialegee Tribal Town and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, signed an eight-month gaming extension with the state on the Model Gaming Compact. More information about the extension agreement can be found here.

""I appreciate the honesty and boldness of the Kialegee Tribal Town and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians who recognize the Jan. 1, 2020, expiration in the Model Gaming Compact and have signed on to the eight-month extension generously offered by the state,"" Stitt said. ""These extensions will enable the parties to negotiate a compact that better accounts for the differing needs of tribes throughout the state and the state’s interests in preserving the substantial exclusivity without a cloud of legal uncertainty.

""The state of Oklahoma offered an extension, with no strings attached, to all tribes that operate casinos in the state, and my door continues to be open for more tribes to join who are worried about impending uncertainty.""

In 2004, Oklahoma voters approved a state question that allowed casino-style gambling and tribal leaders quickly signed the compacts. Now, the excitement from the vote and compacts has led to a bitter dispute and the two sides interpreting the same paragraph in different ways.

Scotland’s fire service is spending increasing amounts of cash on overtime as a result of cuts to firefighter numbers, it has been claimed.

By Gina Davidson Wednesday, 1st January 2020, 6:00 am

Firefighters overtime costs have risen as numbers have dropped, the Scottish Conservatives have claimed.

According to statistics revealed by a Freedom of Information request by the Scottish Conservatives, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spent £7.2 million on overtime costs last year.

The figures come three months after the Fire Brigades Union warned there were “nowhere near enough” firefighters in Scotland, after “severe” cuts over the past decade. The FBU said there were 917 fewer firefighters across the country than there were in 2010, and that there was a need for “radical investment” in recruitment.

Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting...

Yesterday, Scottish Conservative justice spokesperson, Liam Kerr, said the rise in overtime spending proved the impact of fewer firefighter numbers. The overtime figures showed that £5.5 million was spent in 2015/16, followed by £5.8 million the following year. Spending dropped to £4.9 million in 2016/17 but rocketed to £8.3 million in 2017/18, leaving the five-year total standing at more than £31 million.

Mr Kerr said: “We know the fire service has been placed under increasing strain over the years by this SNP government. The fact so many millions more are being spent on overtime payments proves that point.

“Clearly, the existing firefighters and other brigade staff are being asked to do more, and that’s down to a lack of resources. It’s time the SNP started listening to firefighters and provided the organisation with what they need to do the job.

“Of course an organisation like the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service will always require some overtime work, but the millions more being spent in the last couple of years point to a real problem.”

Overtime used 'appropriately'

However David McGown, Deputy Chief Officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said overtime was used ""appropriately"" to ensure the service was able to ""respond effectively to every emergency and protect Scotland's communities.""

He added: “It is an integral part of organisational stability and maintains flexibility and resilience across the Service.

""Nonetheless, we are taking steps to manage our use of overtime including the inward transfer of qualified firefighters from other Services, and a more flexible deployment of resources across Scotland.

“We therefore anticipate an overall reduction in overtime spending in this financial year, compared to the previous two years.”

Mr McGown said that the SFRS was continuing to recruit firefighters. “Not only have we increased the number of wholetime, retained duty and Operations Control firefighters by 199 compared to last year - we also last month welcomed a further 50 wholetime firefighters into the Service and the construction of a new £12million training facility at Newbridge in Edinburgh is now complete.”

A Scottish Government spokesperson said the overtime costs were a small part of the SFRS budget.

“These overtime costs – which of course put extra money into the pockets of Scotland’s hard-working firefighters – were only 2.7 per cent of the Service’s resource budget over that period. We have increased the SFRS budget this year by £5.5 million, taking it to £327 million in 2019-20, to invest in service transformation. This is on top of increasing the spending capacity of the service by £15.5 million in 2018-19. The SFRS is the only fire service in the UK to receive this level of additional funding.

""The number of firefighters per head of population is higher in Scotland than in other parts of the United Kingdom. At March 2019, in Scotland there were 12.1 firefighters per 10,000 population. In England, that figure is just 6.2 and in Wales 8.8.

“We will continue to press the UK Government to return the £50 million paid in VAT between 2013 and 2018. This funding would allow SFRS to do more to keep our communities safe."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, December 31

In a major New Year bonanza for the police personnel, Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta has announced a weekly off and an eight-hour shift for them, saying it will be implemented soon. In an exclusive interview with The Tribune, the DGP says reduction in demand for drugs remains a big challenge even as more than 40,000 persons have been arrested for drug smuggling in the past three years.

In your first year in office, what challenges do you see the state faces on the law and order front?

The year saw big events related to the 550th Parkash Purb celebrations and the opening of the Kartarpur corridor. These posed major security challenges. The past 11 months have been a huge learning experience. We were able to prevent many incidents, but we surely have a lot of ground to cover. Being a border state, Punjab faces challenges like influx of terrorists, smuggling of drugs and weapons and more recently, the use of drones by agencies across the border for anti-India activities.

Is the police force equipped to intercept drones?

The use of Punjab border for weapon smuggling started immediately after the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in August. The primary duty to intercept drones is of the BSF, Air Force and the Army, but the state police have been on high alert too.

There were fears that the corridor might pose a security issue and could be misused by pro-Khalistan activists. Has any specific threat come to light?

The corridor had been the dream of Punjabis for decades. We are happy that it is a reality now, although there are some security concerns. On an average, 1,200 visitors are crossing the border every day. We had certain inputs about some suspicious activity, but no specific case has come to light. We have to remain vigilant since there have been increased efforts to radicalise the youth in Punjab.

How many terror modules have been busted by the police? What kind of people are being radicalised?

Since March 2017, we have busted 51 modules and arrested over 150 members. About 55-60 per cent were radicalised via online campaign and the average age was 18-30.

Was it for money or ideology?

Clearly, there was exchange of sufficient amount of money. Most of the arrested persons were poor, but some were provoked over other reasons too.

The issue of gangs and gangsters has cropped up again by the end of the year.

The gangster cult had grown in the last 10-12 years. The problem became acute by 2016-17. There were some sensational killings and many were roaming free, cocking a snook at the police. We launched a concerted campaign and arrested or neutralised 2,322 gangsters since March 2017. Only less than half a dozen gangsters are yet to be dealt with. Prominent among them are Jaipal, Harvinder Singh alias Rinda and Harry Chatha. We have information that some may have fled abroad. We have also seized 1,318 weapons and nearly 600 vehicles.

Gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria is in news for alleged links with a minister and for issuing threats to Bikram Singh Majithia.

We are looking into the allegations. A probe is on by an SIT headed by DGP (Intelligence) VK Bhawra. So far there is no evidence of his alleged political links. There is no political pressure on the police. The force is free to act against any illegality.

Akalis allege no FIR has been registered over threats to Majithia and police hastily gave clean chit to the minister. Your take?

We are carrying out a fair probe. Let the inquiry be completed. We have shared findings of the preliminary probe. We are questioning a suspect in Bathinda for issuing threats to the former Akali minister.

What is the status on the state’s fight against drugs?

Since March 2017, we have registered 32,500 cases of drug smuggling and arrested 40,455 accused. We have done a fairly good job on the supply reduction front. But the sad part is that nearly 80 per cent of the accused get bail within a few weeks of their arrest. We want amendments to the NDPS Act to reduce minimum commercial quantity of intoxicants to 50-100 gm from 250 gm so that the offenders do not get bail easily.

Will putting drug addicts or small-time peddlers in jail solve the problem?

No, but something needs to be done for cutting the demand. We need to start a fresh drug awareness campaign. It has to be widespread and robust.

The CM had promised an eight-hour shift for cops and a weekly off. It is yet to happen.

We have worked on the proposal. It is going to be implemented in January itself. The CM is going to announce it after the ‘Bara Khana’ with the force. It was delayed because we needed to rationalise staff deployment so that the state’s security is not compromised in any way. We launched a ‘back to the streets’ scheme and found that nearly 7,000 personnel can be deployed with the police districts from their current non-operational assignment. The eight-hour work shift and weekly off would be a huge relief for those posted in police stations or with the traffic police wing."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The Beijing Municipal Health Commission will further strengthen a joint response mechanism with public security organs to tackle medical disputes and incidents involving violence, according to the commission's statement released Tuesday.

The commission will promote local legislative bodies to research legislation on hospital security and urged district-level medical institutions to strengthen their security forces and ensure safety, the statement said.

It was issued after a patient's relative killed a doctor at an emergency ward. The case triggered a major public outcry when the doctor died early the following day.

Yang Wen, the doctor who worked in the emergency department at the Civil Aviation General Hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang district, was stabbed by Sun Wenbin, 55, on Dec 24 and Yang was seriously injured in the neck. Sun was detained three days later on Dec 27, according to Beijing police.

The capital's health commission strongly condemned the ""extreme behavior"" and ""brutal acts"" that the attacker had committed and expressed sincere condolences to the doctor's relatives.

China's top legislature and health commission also condemned the stabbing on Saturday, calling it a serious offense rather than a medical dispute.

China introduced a new law on Saturday, aiming to protect medical workers from violence and protect the personal safety and dignity of medical workers. The law will take effect on June 1."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

MANILA: The Philippines has strongly condemned the reported killing of another Filipino worker in Kuwait, allegedly by her employer’s wife.

The Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs has summoned the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Manila, Musaed Saleh Ahmad Al-Thwaikh, to convey the government’s “outrage over the seeming lack of protection” offered to Filipino workers in the Gulf state.

Continuing violence and abuse violates a May 2018 agreement to protect more than 250,000 Filipino workers in Kuwait, the department said.

Philippines Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. told the Kuwaiti envoy that Manila wanted “swift prosecution” of the perpetrators.

“The friendship between your country, which gives our people jobs they cannot find at home, and our people, whose faithful service make the life of your people easier, depends on justice being done for the murdered maid,” Locsin said.

“I beg you, give her justice,“ he said.

Locsin also warned that the Philippines “will go after the Filipino recruiters and government officials who put her in harm’s way.”

The Philippine Embassy in Kuwait is working with Kuwaiti authorities to investigate the latest attack.

Philippines Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III also condemned what he described as the “violent death” of Villavende at the hands of her Kuwaiti employer.

The labor department’s Overseas Workers Welfare Administration will provide financial assistance to Villavende’s family.

In May, migrants’ rights advocates called on Manila to review an agreement with Kuwait following the murder of Filipino worker Constancia Dayag by her employer.

The Philippines and Kuwait faced a diplomatic crisis after the killing of Filipino worker Joanna Demafelis whose body was found stuffed in a freezer in February 2018.

After Manila imposed a ban on Filipino workers in the Gulf state, Kuwait ordered the Philippines ambassador to leave the country and recalled its own envoy.

The dispute ended after the two countries signed an agreement offering protection to Filipino workers."," Threaten, not specified below",3
4889,c4c7e1eb3ff168c5d7a37a5545cd1bf8,"Best of 2019: Electric buses a golden opportunity for India

India must not squander this chance of electrifying its urban bus transit system and should take care to avoid the mistakes it made while converting diesel-run buses to CNG

Back in 1980, Shenzen was a small fishing village in China with 30,000 residents. Today it’s a mega-metropolis of nearly 13 million people. But the economic turnaround did affect the city’s air quality. In 2016, it’s average PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns) concentration was at 27 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³). It was nearly three times the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s annual limit of 10 µg/m³.

Shezhen was then selected as one of the first Chinese cities where new air pollution control methods would be implemented. Clean and more widely available public transport was a piece of the puzzle, so its diesel buses were shut down and replaced with electric buses.

In 2017 Shenzen became the world’s first city to have a 100% electric bus fleet. They numbered 16,539 in May 2018, and have improved the city’s air quality by cutting 1.3 million tons in annual emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, and 432 tonnes of deadly particulate matter (PM). Shenzen’s 12,518 taxis will follow suit by 2020.

This points to an important lesson: electric vehicles (EVs), and particularly electric buses, are not just a no-brainer for climate action because of their zero emissions. They also make a sizeable difference to urban air quality.

Having learnt from China, Germany, France and Norway have announced targets to phase out all petrol and diesel-powered vehicles by 2050. Meanwhile London levies a congestion charge on such vehicles entering the city – while exempting EVs – to safeguard its air, while Los Angeles is targeting 100% of its vehicles to be emissions-free by 2050. Its underlying motive is to reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, but its air quality will undoubtedly benefit.

India – air quality and climate action

India’s horrendous urban air quality has been much talked about. In 2018, WHO estimated that Delhi’s average PM10 concentration for 2010-2016 was 292 µg/m³. Beijing in comparison – despite its infamous air quality – was at 92.

The WHO’s annual average safe limit for PM10 20 µg/m³. Beyond this people can suffer from minor breathing issues to fatal respiratory diseases, cardiac disorders and the risk of various types of cancer.

An analysis by the medial journal Lancet Planetary Health confirmed the correlation when it attributed the deaths of 1.24 million Indians in 2017 to air pollution. A study by the University of Chicago in 2018 warned that the life expectancy for Delhi’s residents had dropped by up to 10 years.

These are shocking figures. The country also posted a 4.8% rise in carbon emissions in 2018. The news comes when climate scientists are urging that all countries, and especially the major economies, slash their emissions to stave off catastrophic climate change.

Thankfully, urgent calls for action on both fronts have led to two major policy announcements: the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) – notified in January 2019 – and India’s target of 30% EV sales by 2030. Both target a nationwide crackdown on emissions, and as studies suggest, will complement each other perfectly.

Cities and states leading the way

Dehradun, Chandigarh and Guwahati ran pilots in 2018 on using electric buses for public transport. Each city reported positive results on operability, servicing and economics. Electric buses will now be inducted into their fleets in the following numbers: Dehradun 500 (inter-city), Chandigarh 20 and Guwahati 25.

In terms of the states, 1,000 electric buses are scheduled to enter service in Delhi in September 2019 as part of its 2018 EV policy. The West Bengal government has ordered 80 buses, 20 of which have already been delivered, while Karnataka will induct 3,000 electric buses into its fleet by 2022.

In Maharashtra, Pune is currently running 25 e-buses and plans to induct a total of 480 in 2019, while in Mumbai four e-buses have been running since 2017. And as a testament to their utility in difficult terrain, 50 e-buses have also been ordered for mountainous Himachal Pradesh, which ran its first e-bus pilot in 2017.

Clearly, therefore, electric buses have graduated from being an experiment to public workhorses.

Lessons from the CNG experiment

However, India has to be careful that it does not repeat its failure with compressed natural gas (CNG) – where the gains in air quality were frittered away due to “dieselization”.

When Delhi’s 10,000-strong city bus fleet was converted from diesel to CNG by December 2002, there was a notable drop in the PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), SO 2 (sulphur dioxide) and CO (carbon monoxide) concentrations in the city’s air. In fact, for a few months, Delhi had the world’s cleanest public transport system.

However, unrestricted registrations of diesel-powered SUVs, crossovers and even mid-segment family cars quickly worsened the city’s air quality as particulate matter pollution shot up again. So did the concentration of NOx – which is a by-product of the incomplete combustion of diesel.

Thus, even though vehicular pollution was not the only factor, within just over a decade Delhi went from holding an unusually pleasant accolade to a city choking everyone within reach.

How not to repeat past failures

Being a new technology – much like CNG was back in 2001 – electric buses (and EVs in general) have faced a number of issues.

For some time it was the chicken and egg situation of what to build first: the fleet or the charging points. Without adequate numbers for one, the other would make no sense. The entry of established names like NTPC, BHEL, Tata Power and Reliance Power in setting up charging infrastructure has, however, allayed fears.

Safety is another key issue that needs to be communicated well. A few cases of the CNG buses catching fire had fanned wild rumours about their on-road safety and dented many a private customer’s willingness to switch over.

Such incidents can also offer detractors – such as auto manufacturers still resistant to abandoning the internal combustion engine – the opportunity to influence public opinion. The automakers would of course fight for their billions of dollars of investments at stake, but real-world testing has proved that electric buses (and other EVs) are ready for deployment.

In fact an excellent example of this is China’s BYD. The firm not only leads China’s sales figures in electric cars, but its electric buses now ferry passengers in 300 cities worldwide. Back in India, several of Tata’s electric buses have been ordered for their reliability, while Olectra has tied-up with BYD and is running 40 e-buses in Hyderabad.

What India needs to do

While the switch from diesel to CNG was an outcome of judicial activism, electric mobility in India was born with countrywide policy support. That’s a vital head-start, but to ensure that the momentum is not lost, our policy makers must ensure that:

The technology is tested for every possible operating condition (heat, humidity, traffic densities, terrain etc.).

The central and state governments play a pro-active role in working with the industry to refine the products. Hands-off involvement won’t help.

Partnerships are forged with credible research and certification establishments (like the IITs, CSIRs and ARAI) to disseminate easily palatable and unbiased information to all stakeholders.

There must also be a conscious effort made to weed out any misinformation that tarnishes the image of an otherwise reliable product.

Crucially, India is also well positioned to power all EV charging infrastructure solely by clean energy. Therefore, given this golden opportunity, the country must reflect on its past errors and work towards getting it right this time. The rewards of public health benefits and strong climate action are just too crucial to be squandered.

Details of the 5G trials emerged after Department of Telecommunications secretary Anshu Prakash met telecom operators and their equipment partners on Tuesday to discuss the modalities and road map for trials. “The quantum of airwaves which will be given out was not specified in the hour-long meeting, but operators were told they could get as much as they seek, depending upon the use-cases they file,” another official privy to the details of the meeting said.The secretary is said to have told the telcos they could use any band, including 700 MHz, for trials. Telcos can also apply for bandwidth in the 26 GHz band, although the government hasn’t yet asked the regulator to set a floor price for this band, the official added. Telcos were encouraged to conduct trials in urban and rural areas as the government would like to gauge their effectiveness in both settings.The government plans to auction spectrum, including 5G airwaves, in March-April. There is no clarity yet on when the trials will start. Telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Monday that the government would permit all operators and vendors, including Chinese telecom equipment suppliers Huawei and ZTE , to participate in the trials, ending over a year of speculation on the matter. The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , expressed disappointment at the development. “Presence of Chinese companies in our telecommunications network would compromise our national security,” the SJM wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister on Tuesday.The SJM urged the PM to bar Huawei and ZTE from participating in the 5G trials and proposed that India must encourage local companies to develop 5G and 6G technology capability. The government has said that allowing Huawei and ZTE to participate in the trails was independent whether they would be allowed to set up 5G networks in the country. “The telecom department will evaluate 5G trials for security vulnerabilities before taking a final call on the vendors who will be allowed to deploy the next generation airwaves in the country,” a person familiar with the matter told ET. This means there is still no clarity that telcos had sought in the matter to help them choose vendors, industry officials said.The second official said the trials will be scrutinised on a caseto-case basis and specific security concerns will be looked into. The US has been pressuring its allies and friendly countries, including India, to bar Huawei, flagging security concerns and citing the company’s alleged proximity to the Chinese government.

Europe's far right has stalled

Another year, another unrealized right-wing scare in Europe. Though far-right parties are now a fixture on the European political stage, they made no significant gains on the continent in 2019. Despite growing political fragmentation, the center is holding. Nationalist populists are still as unsuited to governing as ever.

I had an early inkling that the far right wouldn't advance much in 2019 when I went to Brussels in February to interview Michel Modrikamen, the Belgian lawyer who was supposed to be U.S. nativist ideologue Steve Bannon's point man in Europe. Bannon had talked about disrupting the European Union's operation by fueling a radical right-wing wave in the European Parliament election in May. But Modrikamen, leader of the People's Party, a small nationalist political force in the francophone part of Belgium, wasn't working on anything as ambitious as that: Instead, he was interested in organizing a kind of discussion club for European nationalist and conservative politicians. Dreams of centralized war rooms for nationalist parties turned out to be unfeasible because of strict campaign financing laws. U.S. money and technological know-how failed to materialize. (The People's Party was disbanded in June after a disappointing showing in the European and Belgian elections).

Matteo Salvini, the Italian rabble-rouser who leads the anti-immigrant League party, was another friend of Bannon's who tried to put together a kind of nationalist international coalition ahead of the European Parliament vote. There was a big rally in Milan to announce the alliance, but Identity and Democracy, the faction formed by Salvini and his allies, ended up as only the fifth-biggest group in the 751-seat legislature, with 73 members. That's an improvement on the 37 its predecessor group, Europe of Nations and Freedom, had in the previous parliament, but the growth came at the expense of other like-minded groups. Salvini's creation was not involved in the haggling over top European Union jobs, and it plays no role in EU decision-making. Given that European elections are often used by national electorates to vent their frustrations, but have little economic impact, this result is the equivalent of a mighty swing-and-miss for the far right.

But then, in the European election, the far right only could have hoped for a symbolic victory. Power in the EU is largely concentrated on the national level, and there, too, the far right failed to pull off any spectacular wins. In the eight EU national elections in which nationalist populist parties had a chance to win seats, their average showing was 12.1% - higher than the 11.7% they won in their countries' previous elections, but still not a frightening percentage.

Nationalist populists only made gains in three of the eight countries - Estonia, Belgium and Spain. In the small Baltic state, ultranationalist EKRE's success was the result of rural voters left behind by the nation's tech boom, which is largely happening in the capital, Tallinn. It could also be related to a bump in nationalist support in neighboring Finland, of which more later.

In Belgium, young Flemish male voters unhappy with the country's multiculturalist policies brought the anti-Islam, anti-immigrant Flemish Interest party a second-place finish in the parliamentary election thanks to its flirting with the alt-right and its success on social media. And in Spain, nationalist Vox's rise was in large part a response to popular demand for an extremely hard line against Catalan secessionists.

Elsewhere, the far right was dealt spectacular defeats. In Denmark, the People's Party crashed at the ballot box after other parties, including the victorious center-left, learned convincingly to back tough but not extreme immigration policies and new, smaller forces challenged the People's Party from the right. In Greece, receding economic pain softened public support for the neo-fascist Golden Dawn. And in Austria, support for the Freedom Party never quite recovered from the scandal that led to the resignation of its former leader Heinz-Christian Strache in May: He'd been caught in an unusual sting operation, drunkenly plotting various shenanigans with a woman he thought was related to a Russian oligarch.

Strache's fall highlighted the fundamental conflict between far-right politicians' ability to perform well in polls and elections and their ineptitude at governing. Salvini provided another glaring example this year when he pulled his party out of the ruling coalition to force an election only to watch his former partners from the left-wing populist Five Star Movement form a new alliance with the centrist Democratic Party. Salvini, formerly Italy's powerful interior minister, found himself out of a job. Though he's still extremely popular and a massive threat to the Italian elite, he'll likely only govern if he can somehow put together a majority together with other far-right forces, such as the Brothers of Italy party.

Governing just doesn't work out well for far-right parties in Europe. In Norway, the popularity of the far-right Progress Party has collapsed because of an endless line of scandals involving its ministers and legislators. In Finland, the nationalist Finns party split in 2017, while part of the governing coalition, because the radical party base considered its ministers too moderate and compromise-minded; now, the party's revived popularity, which has allowed it to hold its own in this year's national election and since propelled it to first place in polls, is the result of a radicalization that makes the Finns a coalition partner to avoid.

In Estonia, three EKRE ministers have already been dismissed, one of them after serving for exactly one day in office. A fourth, Interior Minister Mart Helme, barely survived an attempt to remove him after he called Finland's 34-year old Prime Minister Sanna Marin a ""sales girl."" Further EKRE missteps, dismissals and confidence votes will remain a threat to Estonia's government coalition next year.

Far-right parties do best in elections when they're in opposition - when they can play the ""no one likes us, we don't care"" card, as one researcher wrote about the Finns this year. That's why I regret the adamant refusal of Germany's mainstream political parties to form coalitions with the nationalist Alternative for Germany after its strong showing in three state elections in the country's east this year (it came second in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg). Letting the far right get a taste of actual responsibility and the constraints that come with it tends to open voters' eyes - and in coalition governments, even populist rabble-rousers have to try to act reasonably, so the damage can be minimized.

The far-right tendency to fail at governing is one reason such parties usually do better in polls than in elections. The average support level of Europe's far-right parties in December, 2019 is 14% - exactly the same as a year ago.

Averages can be deceptive, of course. But only five European far-right parties enjoy more than 20% support at the end of the year, if one counts Switzerland's powerful People's Party, which saw a slight dip in electoral support this year. Of the other four, only Liga, the Finns and the Sweden Democrats are viable threats to centrist governments in their countries; in France, with its strong presidency, Marine Le Pen would need to win a presidential election for her National Rally party to govern, and she's already been beaten twice by centrists.

Italy and two Nordic countries, then, are where far-right gains threaten to destabilize political systems in the near future. The Italian case is complex: The country has a powerful right-wing tradition, and its voters are tired of government dysfunction and an anemic economy. Only the emergence of equally charismatic leaders capable of outshining Salvini can neutralize the threat he presents.

Sweden and Finland are another matter. The far right is strong there because the Nordics, with their generous social safety nets, have been failing at immigrant integration. Ghettos have emerged, education and health care systems have begun crumbling at the edges, and voters have noticed. To find an alternative to the Danish scenario of an anti-immigration consensus, these countries need to get better at pulling newcomers into their tight social fabric - an exercise that requires visionary leadership and smart policymaking, which have been lacking the last few years as the inflow of immigrants has grown.

In the rest of Europe, political elites are learning to live with parties whose leaders say the formerly unspeakable, make offensive gestures and gather raucous crowds carrying signs not since since before World War II. These political forces can be loud nuisances, but then protest parties always are. The trick is not to let them grow into something bigger - a fascist tide of the kind that swept over Europe in the 1930s. That sometimes means letting the troublemakers into government as a kind of inoculation.

So far, European centrists largely are doing OK at containing the infection.

As 2020 dawns, Georgia faces another wild election year full of fascinating personalities and consequential debates.

Gov. Brian Kemp enters his second year in Georgia’s top job with a steep agenda – and a reputation on the line with Kelly Loeffler as his pick for the U.S. Senate. His top Democratic rival, Stacey Abrams, has positioned herself as a potential 2020 presidential running mate.

Republicans who showed a willingness to engage in partisan battles last year could hit the gas in 2020 to energize their base ahead of the election, or they could try to broaden their appeal to the center. Meanwhile, revved-up Democrats hope to consolidate their suburban gains and finally flip Georgia after a long stretch of futility.

Here are some of the biggest questions in Georgia politics that your Atlanta Journal-Constitution team will be watching this year:

(And check out our answers to questions from 2018 and 2019.)

Will Republicans hold the Georgia House?

After carving a blue path through Atlanta’s suburbs in 2018, Democrats are closer to recapturing the Georgia House than they have been in years. The party needs to flip at least 16 seats to gain control of the chamber – a lofty, but not impossible, goal.

Democratic leaders hope to transform outrage over stiff new anti-abortion restrictions and frustration with Kemp and Trump into major gains at the ballot box. Republicans are confident that their conservative policies will keep Georgia in the GOP fold.

The battle over legislative control won’t garner as many headlines as other elections, but it could be the most consequential. It’s why both parties have pledged to spend millions of dollars in 2020 fighting over down-ticket races.

If Democrats take the chamber, they will secure a larger role in crafting policies and shaping the state budget with a GOP-controlled Senate and Republican governor. And they will have a seat at the table as lawmakers redraw Georgia’s political maps after the U.S. census in 2020.

Abrams managed to raise her national profile higher than ever in 2019, turning her narrow defeat to Kemp in 2018 into a springboard to bigger things.

She drew sell-out crowds on an international book tour, courted presidential candidates and snapped a tradition of lackluster responses with her rebuttal to the State of the Union.

In between, she expanded her Fair Fight voting rights group to 19 other states, launched a group aimed at an accurate U.S. census count and started a think tank to push liberal policies across the South.

After deciding not to run for the U.S. Senate in April, she’s still made it clear she has lofty political ambitions that might go beyond a 2022 rematch against Kemp.

By year’s end, headlines bubbled up every week mentioning her as a potential running mate to top Democratic White House hopefuls, and she was seen as a certainty to be on plenty of shortlists.

Even Abrams has marveled at the heights of her political celebrity, quipping to a crowd of Vanderbilt University students last year: “I’m a really good loser.”

How will Georgia's rollout of new voting machines go?

Georgia enters the new year with more scrutiny than ever into its voting system following the razor-thin contest between Kemp, who as secretary of state shaped Georgia’s voting policies, and Abrams, who accused the Republican of using his position to tilt the balance in his favor.

In his first months as governor, Kemp signed a bill that replaces Georgia’s outdated voting machines, extends the time before registrations are canceled and prohibits precinct closures within 60 days of elections. But the debate infuriated critics who, among other problems, see the machines as inherently insecure.

State officials face a court-ordered deadline to get rid of the state’s 18-year-old paperless voting system before ballots are cast in 2020, and they are scrambling to set up more than 33,000 new voting machines that feature touchscreen voting with printed ballots by the March 24 presidential primary.

Pending litigation could force more changes, including a far-reaching lawsuit filed by Abrams’ voting rights group that seeks to halt voter registration cancellations, prevent ballot rejections and keep polling places open.

How will Georgia’s congressional delegation change?

Georgia’s contingent in Washington has not faced this level of potential upheaval in more than a decade.

The senior-most Republican in Georgia’s House delegation, Tom Graves, abruptly announced his retirement in early December. The senior-most Democrat in Georgia’s House delegation, John Lewis, revealed he had late-stage pancreatic cancer a few weeks later.

An unpredictable free-for-all formed in the race to replace another retiring Republican, U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall, in a Gwinnett County-based district that’s become one of the most competitive in the nation.

And Democratic U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath faces a 2020 rematch against Republican Karen Handel after she flipped the seat straddling Atlanta’s northern suburbs in 2018.

There’s also a distinct possibility of another vacancy as U.S. Rep. Doug Collins flirts with a Senate run against Loeffler, possibly with the support of the White House.



The Senate delegation is in just as much flux.

Isakson’s decision to retire because of mounting health issues ended his 45-year career in politics and left Georgia without one of the state’s most seasoned and respected lawmakers. His successor, Loeffler, is a financial executive who is little-known even to top Republican officials.

And U.S. Sen. David Perdue faces his own challenges as he runs for what he’s said is his final term. At least four well-known Democrats have lined up to face the former Fortune 500 executive.

How will Gov. Brian Kemp handle his second year in office?

The first lifelong Republican elected as Georgia governor since Reconstruction, Kemp spent his first year in the office pursuing a range of policies his predecessors avoided.

He signed anti-abortion restrictions that triggered threats of a Hollywood boycott and backed a health care overhaul that would add tens of thousands of low-income Georgians to the Medicaid rolls but stops short of the full expansion sought by Democrats and some Republicans.

And he forced tough fiscal negotiations with a call for budget cuts of 4% and 6% over the next two years that could lead to hundreds of unfilled positions and a reduction in services.

He’ll begin 2020 with a call for tougher crackdowns on violent criminals and gang activity, veering from the eight-year effort by his predecessor, Nathan Deal, to overhaul the criminal justice system by reducing penalties for low-level offenders.

The governor will also have new chances for high-profile appointments after surprising even his critics with a drove of selections to top political and judicial posts that culminated with his selection of Loeffler to the U.S. Senate seat.

And he’ll be under pressure from conservatives who fueled his victory to fulfill his campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, expand gun rights and adopt a “religious liberty” proposal in an election year.

How will Kelly Loeffler perform in the U.S. Senate?

When Loeffler applied for the open U.S. Senate seat in November, there was an immediate stir from her fellow Republicans: Who is this financial executive, and what did she stand for?

A wave of apprehension from conservative activists followed as her critics pored through her financial records, raised concerns about potential ethical issues over her corporate ties and questioned whether she was a closet moderate.

The governor’s decision to tap her for the seat defied Trump’s pleas for Kemp to appoint Collins or another politically tested conservative to the post. Loeffler’s tried to calm those fears with promises to back Trump’s agenda and reach out to grassroots activists.

Still, her appointment has sparked rifts within the Georgia GOP that will be hard to heal. Many local Republican leaders have pointedly not offered her an endorsement, instead taking a wait-and-see approach to how she handles her first months on the job.

And as she prepares to take office in early January, she faces the possibility of a challenge from Collins or another GOP rival, even as Democrats try to unite behind their own contender – whoever that may be -- for the November special election.

Can Democrats flip Georgia and win its two U.S. Senate seats?

Not since Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory has a Democratic presidential candidate carried the state. And no Democrat has won a statewide contest in Georgia since 2006.

Just about every cycle since then, the same question has been asked: “Is this the election that turns Georgia into a battleground state?”

The answer was clear in years gone by, when national Democrats largely avoided Georgia and state candidates steered clear of national figures. But the tight 2018 election offered a different lesson, one that even top Republicans dubbed a “wake-up call” for their party.

Democratic White House hopefuls swarmed the state with Georgia-centric appeals and lavished praise on Abrams, who warned it would be “political malpractice” to ignore the state. And local Democrats seized the chance to use November’s presidential candidates debate in Georgia as a chance to showcase the party’s 2020 strategy.

Still, the Georgia GOP opens the year with huge advantages. Top Republican candidates have built lofty campaign accounts, hold all the levers of power in Georgia and will look to turn the Democratic-led impeachment of Trump into a campaign battle cry.

Meanwhile, Democrats end the year with no clear front-runners in either Senate contest after Abrams and other prominent leaders passed on the chance to run. And many top party figures have yet to pick a side in the presidential race as concerns grow about a drawn-out battle for the nomination.

The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has warned new commissioners and special advisers in the state to forget about the 2023 governorship position.

He asked them to focus on the implementation of the 2020 budget the state.

Wike issued the warning while swearing in, 13 commissioners and 15 special advisers, at the Government House in Port Harcourt on Tuesday.

He told his new aides to resign immediately if they were in his administration to look for money to run for the 2023 governorship position.

He said, “Work for the interest of Rivers State. This is a rare privilege to serve Rivers State.”

“Everything must not be money. As it has pleased God, you have been given the opportunity to assist in the development of Rivers State.

“Now that the State Executive Council has been formed, the implementation of the 2020 budget will start in earnest.

“If you know you are looking for money for 2023, resign now.

“I will not hesitate to remove you. There will be sanctions if I discover that any commissioner or special adviser is holding meetings on who will be governor in 2023.”

US President Donald Trump warned Tehran it would ""pay a very big price"" after a mob of pro-Iranian demonstrators stormed the American embassy compound in Iraq, as his government said it is sending hundreds more troops to the Middle East.

Angered by US air strikes that killed two dozen paramilitary fighters on Sunday, hundreds of protesters spilled through checkpoints in the high-security Green Zone Tuesday, demanding the removal of American troops from Iraq and voicing loyalty to a powerful Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attack was ""orchestrated by terrorists,"" one of whom he named as Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Muhandis has been identified as second-in-command of the Tehran-backed Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary group which includes Kataeb Hezbollah, the group that was targeted in the US air strikes.

Defence Secretary Mark Esper said around 750 troops from a rapid response unit of the 82nd Airborne Division are prepared to deploy over the next several days to the region.

""This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,"" he said.

Prior to the announcement, a US official told AFP that ""up to 4,000 (troops) may ultimately be deployed"".

The US had already flown a rapid response team of Marines into Baghdad to reinforce its embassy after the attack Tuesday, which left smoke and flames rising from the embassy entrance and further heightened tension between Tehran and Washington.

Esper's announcement is the latest move by Washington to step up its defences in the region since US President Donald Trump in May 2018 pulled out of a multinational nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed crippling economic sanctions.

Trump blamed Tehran for the embassy attack and warned that it would face punishment if Americans are killed.

""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,"" Trump said on Twitter.

""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,"" wrote Trump, adding ""Happy New Year!""

However, Trump later told reporters that he did not foresee war with Tehran.

Trump's message came at the end of a day in which Washington officials appeared surprised and furious over the ease at which the protestors entered the Green Zone, reaching the US embassy compound for the first time in years.

Live broadcasts showed the protesters battering down the high-security doors of the embassy reception building, smashing windows, burning a sentry box and chanting ""Death to America!""

The State Department and Pentagon demanded Iraq's leaders provide security to the compound -- which was already heavily fortified.

By the time a contingent of US Marine reinforcements flew in, some of the demonstrators had pulled back and others settled in for a sustained protest, preparing food for the evening.

Tehran said the United States is itself to blame for air strikes that killed about two dozen Kataeb Hezbollah fighters on Sunday.

""The surprising audacity of American officials is so much that after killing at least 25... and violating the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, that now... they attribute the Iraqi people's protest against their cruel acts to the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi.

The mob attack put a focus on the strains in the US-Iraqi relationship. Allies of Iran, which enjoys significant support in parts of the Iraqi government, increasingly challenge Washington's influence in the country.

US jet fighters on Sunday struck five Kateab Hezbollah outposts in Iraq and Syria after a series of rocket attacks on US-occupied facilities in Iraq over the past two months that are blamed on the group and its alleged Iranian sponsors.

One of those attacks, in Kirkuk on Friday, left an American civilian contractor dead and exhausted what US officials called Trump's ""strategic patience"" with Tehran.

It also added to the growing calls by some political factions in Iraq to push US troops out of the country nearly 17 years after they entered and overthrew Saddam Hussein's regime.

The protesters who besieged the US embassy on Tuesday carried posters reading: ""Parliament should oust US troops, or else we will!""

Late Tuesday Kataeb Hezbollah hailed the attack as a ""first lesson"" to Washington, ""so that Trump knows he did something extremely stupid""."," Threaten, not specified below",3
5268,bc5423350fd6a94b0ad13fa126af4fbf,"If IMO Tier III regulations go through, Viking says it may not be able to build its 92- and 93-foot models, which could mean hundreds of job cuts. Viking Yachts

At the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, Pat Healey, the president and CEO of Viking Yacht Co., warned that pending International Maritime Organization Tier III emissions regulations are the “greatest threat to the marine industry since the luxury tax days.”

The regulations would require diesel yachts with a minimum load-line length of 78 feet to meet NOx emissions requirements that are 75 percent more stringent than the Tier II rules established in 2011. A boat with a load-line length of 78 feet is basically a 90-foot boat. The new regulations were introduced in January 2016 and are scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, 2021. They apply to any vessel in North America, the Caribbean, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and “all future NOx emission control areas.” If a boat passes through these areas, it must produce the clean emissions. If a keel is laid before the end of 2020, the boat can still be built and finished in 2021 without meeting the regulations.

Last year, the International Council of Marine Industry Associations attempted to delay the implementation of the regulations beyond 2021 but was unsuccessful. Member states, including Norway, Germany and Canada, voted against the extension. There is an appeals process, and builders are planning to use it to try again for the extension at the IMO MEPC 75 meeting scheduled for March 30 through April 3, but Healey isn’t optimistic.

“We’re up against the majority of the E.U. and Canada,” he says. “They’ve blocked the extension of the exemption.” Healey says an extension would give boatbuilders and engine manufacturers more time to develop compatible systems for their yachts.

MAN’s Selective Catalytic Reduction system and additional equipment will be nearly the same size as the engine with which it works. MAN

The problem isn’t that the technology for reducing the emissions doesn’t exist. MTU, MAN, Volvo Penta and Cummins all have what are called Selective Catalytic Reduction systems, and they are in use on commercial vessels. The problem on a recreational vessel is that the equipment would take up a large amount of space in an engine compartment while adding significant costs to the boat. MAN’s SCR system, for instance, can be as large as the engine that it will service. Another concern is that SCR systems require a chemical called urea. Urea has to be stored in a separate tank and must remain at a cooler temperature, so it likely couldn’t be in the boat’s engine compartment.

“We don’t have the room to install the systems,” Healey says. “If we install the systems, we have no room to work on the engines. It’s just an ill-conceived regulatory system.

”Viking says proponents of the regulations are taking the wrong approach by simply saying that large-yacht buyers can afford to make the vessels compliant, and dismissing any other arguments against the regulations. The company says that if an extension isn’t granted, it won’t be able to build its 92-foot Convertible and 93-foot Yacht for the export market. If orders for those boats dwindle, it may have to lay off the 300 employees who build them.

“This is a jobs issue,” Healey says. “The regulators didn’t consider the people building the engines, the people taking care of the engines, and the people building the boats.”

In correspondence with Soundings Trade Only sister magazine Yachts International, Hatteras/Cabo Yachts, another U.S. manufacturer that builds boats in the size range that would be affected, says it has researched SCR implications and has been working with Caterpillar, MTU and industry experts.

“We have the latest SCR systems’ drawings in hand and understand the implications for both unit installations and requirements for the urea tanks, as well,” said Ward Setzer, Hatteras/Cabo chief product officer. “The overall impact on vessel offerings such as our own may, indeed, be complicated, if not inconvenient.

Engines in yachts in the size ranges that would be impacted already take up significant space, so there are concerns about adding more equipment. MAN

“It would be nice to have a bit more time to adjust for these both large and complicated units,” he continued. “However, the commercial world has already adopted the applications, and we will soon be required to do the same on projects over 24 meters and of a certain horsepower, but we also should take this as a warning for the next levels of requirements that may soon address vessels under this size range, having far-ranging impacts on many builders of luxury yachts.”

European builders that will be affected include the Ferretti Group, Azimut, Sunseeker, Princess, Sanlorenzo and others.

“Most of the European manufacturers say they’re going to push back against it,” says Sean Robertson, sales and marketing director for Sunseeker International. “However, they are proactively planning that the regulations will take effect and new models will be designed around accommodating them.”

Sunseeker’s 116 Yacht has been redesigned to accommodate an SCR system, and Robertson says that it will primarily impact the engine compartment and garage. The company is working with engine maker MTU on an SCR system.

Leading the Charge

Udo Kleinitz, secretary general of the International Council of Marine Industry Associations, says that his organization has been trying to show the impracticality of the regulations since they were first discussed in 2008. Kleinitz, who negotiated the extension in 2016 to 2021, remains part of the appeals effort.

“We have been trying to show the difficulty and disproportionate measure and how it impacts yachts,” Kleinitz says. “It’s not a European or American issue. We want them to understand the job losses, the effect to the companies and loss of sales. That’s one of the legs we want to stand on. The other is the space you need to create this system in the boat. It creates big problems.”

Kleinitz says there is a political element, too, because officials need to demonstrate that they are addressing the issue of emissions, even in cases where the solutions do not make sense. Because the regulations are a United Nations treaty that can’t be revoked, pressuring elected officials won’t produce many results. That’s why the extension is the most practical approach.

“We are assembling our arguments now. We will only go forward if we know we have a good case and if we have support,” Klein­itz says, adding that a member state of IMO needs to propose the appeal for it go forward.

Cummins’ SCR system has been used in commercial applications, but not on yachts. Cummins

Impractical for Yachts

Healey and Kleinitz both acknowledge that the technology exists to produce the required NOx emissions numbers, but that it is impractical for yachts.

The primary problem is the size of the equipment needed to clean up the exhaust. It’s installed inline abaft the turbochargers, and it requires the tankage for urea, or diesel exhaust fluid. Simply put, the equipment cleans the exhaust prior to it leaving the boat. On freighters, it’s sometimes referred to as a scrubber.

In an email to Soundings Trade Only, Capt. Jennifer McQuilken, marketing communications leader for marine, oil and gas for Cummins, estimated that an SCR system including urea tankage, pumps, after-treatment equipment and related plumbing is about 75 percent to 80 percent the size of the engine it cleans. Axel St. Aubin, program manager for off-road engines and emissions certification for MAN, says that for a V-12 or V-16 diesel, the SCR system is “roughly the same size as the engine.”

The base engines for the Viking 92 Convertible are twin Caterpillar C32As, which measure 89.9 inches long by 60.17 inches wide by 62.5 inches tall. One system is required for each engine in a boat, so on a boat the size of the Viking 92C, it’s basically taking up the space of a guest stateroom or crew quarters. Tankage for the urea should be 10 percent of the boat’s fuel capacity.

St. Aubin estimates that an SCR system also adds about 10 to 20 percent to the price of an engine. McQuilken says the number is closer to 40 to 50 percent.

Because the aftertreatment works much like a catalytic converter on a gasoline engine, it’s possible that the most dangerous hurdle to overcome in an enclosed area like an engine compartment is the heat generated by the cleaning process.

St. Aubin says MAN’s system starts injecting the diesel exhaust fluid at about 400 F, just ahead of the catalyst. When the temperature reaches about 480 degrees, the system goes to closed loop to monitor NOx-in concentrations and NOx-out concentrations.

“We’re able to achieve a very high conversion efficiency of the NOx to nitrogen and water,” St. Aubin says. Regarding heat, he adds, “You can insulate and vent the engine compartment; about 30 percent of your engine energy is expelled through your exhaust heat.”

In addition to heat, creating excessive backpressure is a concern. Using too much urea also is an issue because it turns into ammonia.

Healey says the unknown factors are going to be an issue. “It’s trial by error, and the boatbuilders have no control over how they’re going to operate,” he says. “The problem is the as-yet-unknown problems that will be associated with this.”

Pat Healey fought the 1990s luxury tax and is prepared to battle the emissions regulations. Eric Colby

When it comes to the hope that the systems will get smaller, St. Aubin says, “I can’t see a whole lot of potential for downsizing SCR systems. You need that catalytic reactive surface to get to the conversion efficiencies to get to the lower NOx emissions.”

ICOMIA’s Kleinitz says that if diesel fuel with a lower sulfur content were being used on a more global level, there would be a greater possibility of the equipment getting smaller.

While tankage needs for urea is one concern, availability is another. Yachts would have to go to commercial facilities to take on urea or have it delivered, which isn’t a hardship for larger vessels, but the owner of a 90-foot yacht expects to be able to take on fuel at a consumer facility like Florida’s Lauderdale Marina, which didn’t have urea as of early December. “We anticipate this changing as demand for urea increases and becomes a common supply at ports of call for larger pleasure yachts,” Cummins’ McQuilken says.

Healey and Setzer both say they hope the size of the treatment systems can be reduced to make them more viable for pleasure use.

Kleinitz says he is “trying to keep expectations low,” adding, “At the moment, the message on these regs is, ‘They’re coming.’ ”

While Healey admits that he might be waging an uphill fight, he isn’t ready to throw in the towel. “We’ve fought this battle without being in the public eye,” he says. “But now we have to get the word out. We have one more bite at the apple.”

The police said that the gang members committed house-breaking offences in Hyderabad, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

news Crime

Seven members of the notorious inter-state 'Ghuman' (nomadic) gang have been arrested in Hyderabad and 14 offences they committed in Telangana and other states over the past few months have been detected, the police said on Tuesday.

A total of 150 gm of gold ornaments, 400 gm of silver and other valuables, all worth Rs 6.55 lakh, was seized from the seven, the police said.

The police said that the gang members, all native of West Bengal and presently residing in Maharashtra, committed eight house breaking offences in Hyderabad in October and November this year, and similar crimes in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

A special team using high-end technology and human intelligence information system worked for two months and visited six states and identified the movements of the offenders in Maharashtra’s Akola and in Shimla, Rachakonda Police Commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat told reporters.

The seven were caught on Monday when they again came to the city and planned to commit offences, he said.

""They used to select a city and reach the city by train and choose an isolated area at the outskirts, visit it and conduct a recce to identify isolated colonies where semi-forest area exists with bushes,"" the police said in a press release.

The accused would then hide out in the bushes till late in the night and strike at houses after midnight, either by picking the lock or by breaking open the door with a boulder.

The families of the gang were nomadic, and they used to move from different states while the accused used to commit the crime by wearing minimal clothing, the police said.

""They used to remove their pants and shirts and keep the same in a shoulder bag because if they move with clothes, there is a chance of tear in the bushes, which would raise suspicion,"" the police said.

5402,d9933b2d011a3e1c981f396c030f0435,"Newly-appointed Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Wednesday said the armed forces need to pay more attention and develop the capabilities along the border with China, NDTV reported. Naravane made the comment a day after taking charge as the 28th chief of Army staff, replacing Bipin Rawat.

Naravane had on Tuesday warned Pakistan that India reserved “the right to preemptively strike” at sources of terror. “Terrorism is a worldwide problem, India has been at the receiving end of terrorism for a long time,” he had said. “It is only now that the entire world and many countries affected with terrorism, are coming to realise what a threat it is.”

But, he said on Wednesday, there was a lot of attention on the western front but not the northern front. “It is in that context that we are now going in for capability development even in the northern borders, which includes the north-east parts of our country,” Naravane said. He earlier headed the Eastern Command of the Army, which looks over the 4,000-km border with China.

“We have the Line of Actual Control with China. The border question is yet to be settled,” he said. “However, we have made a lot of progress in maintaining peace and tranquility along the borders. And I am sure that the situation will prevail. And by maintaining peace and tranquility along the borders we will be able to set the stage for an eventual solution.”

There have been several reports of incursions by Chinese soldiers in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh in the last few years. In 2017, a 73-day standoff was triggered by the attempts of Chinese troops to build a road close to Indian border in Doklam, an area also claimed by Bhutan.

New research suggests people in Dorset made their way through more than 1.5 million alcoholic beverages on Christmas Day alone – but Drinkaware is warning residents to keep their consumption in check.

In a survey carried out by the charity, the average UK man admitted knocking back six drinks on Christmas Day, while women said they get through four-and-a-half.

In Dorset, that would equate to a whopping 1,612,331 beverages, using the most recent population estimates from the Office for National Statistics.

If a pint of beer were the universal poison of choice, that would be enough to fill 11,451 bathtubs.

Alternatively, if everybody opted for a medium-sized glass of wine each time they hit the bottle, residents would guzzle down as many litres as the amount of water used to run the average shower for 25 days straight.

Across the South West as a whole, the festivities will see thirsty revellers washing down their Christmas dinners with 23,524,000 drinks – the equivalent of 5.3 Olympic-sized swimming pools of beer.

But the figures could be just the tip of the iceberg, with Drinkaware chief executive Elaine Hindal warning that people in the UK tend to significantly underestimate how much they drink.

She said: ""The festive season can be a jolly time for some, and a stressful time for others.

""Whether you face juggling families, work and friends with festive celebrations or whether this time of year is particularly tough for you, there can be a number of triggers that make you feel pressured to drink more than you usually do.

“But drinking more than you’re used to can lead to mistakes, regrets and hangovers. In the long run, it can significantly increase your risk of developing a range of diseases if you’re regularly drinking over the recommended weekly 14 units a week.

“Keeping track of your drinks and staying in control will help you to enjoy everything December has to offer.”

The poll also found that one in five people feel pressured to drink on Christmas Day, and 13% say they avoid social occasions over the festive period because of the pressure.

Drinkaware recommends drinking water and eating when consuming alcohol, having at least three alcohol-free days a week, and avoiding drinking in rounds."," Threaten, not specified below",3
5459,94822238e3b26f9ab8663fc58c8f150e,"SYDNEY: A third person was confirmed dead on Wednesday in devastating bushfires that engulfed Australia’s southeast coast this week and a fourth was missing and feared dead, as navy ships rushed to provide supplies and assist with evacuations.

Twelve people have now lost their lives in fire-related deaths across Australia since blazes broke out a few months ago, including three volunteer firefighters, after a three-year drought in large parts of the nation created tinder-dry conditions.

Fanned by soaring temperatures, columns of fire and smoke blackened entire towns on Monday and Tuesday, forcing thousands of residents and holidaymakers to seek shelter on beaches. Many stood in shallow water to escape the flames.

Bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares and new blazes are sparked almost daily by extremely hot and windy conditions and, most recently, dry lightning strikes created by the fires themselves.

Cooler conditions on Wednesday gave the country a moment to count the cost of the fires, although there were still more than 100 blazes in New South Wales (NSW) state alone and thousands of firefighters on the ground.

The body of a man was found in a burnt car early on Wednesday on the south coast of New South Wales after emergency workers began reaching the most damaged areas, and police said the death toll will rise.

“Sadly, we can report today that police have confirmed a further three deaths as a result of the fires on the South Coast,” NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys told reporters in Sydney.

“Police are also at Lake Conjola now, where a house has been destroyed by fire and the occupant of that home is still unaccounted for.”

NSW police did not identify the missing man but said he was 72 years old and authorities have been unable to reach his home.

Police said early assessments have found nearly 200 homes have been destroyed, though they cautioned it was an early estimate.

Large-scale livestock and animal casualties are also expected across Australia’s east coast, though Mogo Zoo – home to Australia’s largest collection of primates, along with zebras, white rhinos, lions, tigers and giraffes – was saved.

The wildlife park was threatened by an out-of-control bushfire, though zoo keepers and firefighters managed to save all 200 animals.

In Victoria state, four people remain missing, state Premier Daniel Andrews said, after a massive blaze ripped through Gippsland – a rural region about 500km east of Melbourne.

About 4,000 people in the town of Mallacoota in Victoria headed to the waterfront after the main road was cut off.

Mark Tregellas, a resident of Mallacoota who spent the night on a boat ramp, said only a late shift in the wind direction sparred lives.

“The fire just continued to grow and then the black started to descend. I couldn’t see the hand in front in my face, and it then it started to glow red and we knew the fire was coming,” Tregellas told Reuters.

“Ash started to fall from the air and then the embers started to come down. At that point, people started to bring their kids and families into the water. Thankfully, the wind changed and the fire moved away.”

In Milton, a small town on the on the NSW south coast, locals queued for hours for the few remaining items left of shelves on supermarkets.

Emma Schirmer, who evacuated from her house in Batemans Bay with her three-month child on Tuesday, said the local shop was limiting sales to six items per customer, while a power outage meant shoppers could pay only with cash.

As shops run low and firefighters struggle with exhaustion, Australia’s military, including Black Hawk helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and naval vessels were being deployed.

“We’ve got choppers taking 90 firefighters out of the Mallacoota area, they can’t be removed any other way – we’re essentially doing a shift change by the air,” Andrews told reporters.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said authorities were working to restore communications with areas cut off by the fires, and she warned conditions will deteriorate again over the weekend.

“Weather conditions on Saturday will be as bad as they were” on Tuesday, Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.

Meanwhile, Australia’s capital Canberra was blanketed in thick smoke, reaching about 20 times hazardous levels, prompting health warnings.

The smoke has also drifted to New Zealand where it has turned the daytime sky orange across the South Island.

Police say they suspect that Adalberto Morales walked into Macy’s on Union Street at about 7:45 a.m. through an employee entrance, then grabbed four, Tommy Hilfiger jackets valued at about $400 from a rack before he attempted to escape.

A store employee confronted Morales, who then pulled a knife and threatened to stab the employee. Morales then ran out of the store with the coats and climbed into a Honda Pilot that carried him away, according to police.

Patrol officers found the Honda and Morales on Wolcott Street hours later. The stolen jackets were still in the back of the Pilot and police say Morales had a knife on him, according to police.

Morales, of 222 Bradley Ave., was charged with first-degree robbery, threatening and larceny. He was held on a $50,000 bond.

5490,af33dda0e05549be1923ff5a082471c2,"The three major highways and toll systems that were approved by the state legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis at an estimated cost of $10 billion in May will be a disaster for Florida's endangered panthers, says a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services.

The emails from the department were sent out in March while the state legislature was considering the massive new highway systems.

Matthew Schwartz, Executive Director of the South Florida Wildlands Association (SFWA), said his organization uncovered the emails after putting in a Freedom of Information Law request to state and federal agencies to find out if there had been any environmental reports regarding the M-CORES law, knowing there was going to be consequences for wetlands.

""Something like this hasn't been done since the Florida Turnpike in the 1950s,"" Schwartz said. ""It will be a disaster for the panther.""

Through the request to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the SFWA obtained emails from John Wrublik, a scientist and transportation specialist with the Planning and Resource Conservation Division in Vero Beach to Mark Cantrell, Deputy Project Leader and Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office in March. The emails also involve the South Florida Ecological Services Office and reference David Shindle, the Florida Panther Coordinator at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Naples Sub-Office.

The correspondence within the agency that was released by the SFWA show serious concern about the bill as it was pending before the state legislature.

Among the three new highways, Wrublik said the one that would affect South Florida is the proposed new corridor from Polk County through Collier County. This is known as the Southwest-Central Florida Connector and the state's map for the project shows it currently going through most of Lee County through the exact route has not yet been developed.

""This was known previously as the Heartland Expressway,"" Wrublik stated in the email. ""I had seen this proposal several years ago but it went away. It is now, possibly, rearing its head again. This project would have very serious impacts on the Florida panther (basically a disaster for the panther as it goes through, and would open up for more development, some of the best and last remaining habitat for the panther) as well as other fish and wildlife resources and the environment.""

Wrublik said he was relaying word from other senior members in the South Florida Ecological Services Office that have ""serious, serious concerns about the heartland expressway and likely the other two corridors should this legislative proposal go forward.""

In the email, Wrublik stated the ""project would directly result in the loss of a significant amount of habitat types that provide some of the last remaining habitat for the endangered Florida panther and other species of listed and non-listed fish and wildlife.

2) project would indirectly result in the loss of significant amount of habitat for panther and other species by inducing new residential and commercial development by providing new access to a large acreage of undeveloped lands that currently doesn't have a road infrastructure

3) project would significantly increase the potential for vehicle-related injuries and mortalities of panthers and other wildlife species. This is currently a serious threat to the remaining panther population and would get much worse.

4) these impacts collectively would further imperil the panther and could potentially jeopardize the species.

The issue with analyzing the project so far, Schwartz said, is ""there are no routes yet.""

Schwartz said the Southwest-Central Florida Connector project will cut through the heart of the panther's territory including areas from Lakeland County down to Naples while slicing through Lee County. ""This will go through the uplands of the where the panthers live,"" Schwartz said.

It's not just the roads that will affect the panthers but also the developments that will spring up along the new highway, he said. The biggest killer of panthers are automobiles. ""It will be an unmitigated disaster.""

""What we're really looking at is the end of rural Florida,"" he said.

In addition to the threats against the panthers, the Southwest Florida Wildlands Association is also concerned about the impact the highways will have on wetlands, water use and stormwater runoff.

""We basically see it as just a gift to wealthy landowners and developers paid for by Florida taxpayers.""

The highway project was championed in part by State Senate President Bill Galvano (R-Bradenton).

""Galvano has the nerve to say the concerns (of Wrublik) are overstated. He (Galvano) has no expertise in wildlife,"" Schwartz said. Galvano did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment. During comments made in December with reporters regarding Wrublik's assessment which were widely shared by media outlets, Galvano called the assessment ""overstated.""

Messages left with the office of Gov. Ron DeSantis were not returned.

""Every environmental organization opposes this,"" Schwartz said. That includes the Sierra Club.

""If this went up for referendum, it would fail miserably.""

The next step in the process is for the State Department of Transportation to convene a task force for each corridor comprised of representatives from state agencies and other stakeholders to evaluate and coordinate corridor analysis, environmental and land use impacts, and other pertinent impacts of the corridors. The task force must issue a written report by June 30, 2020. To the maximum extent feasible, construction of the projects must begin no later than Dec. 31, 2022, and be open to traffic no later than Dec. 31, 2030.

""Now it will go through permitting but it's already state law that it gets built. They approved it before they studied it,"" Schwartz said. ""It will change the quality of the state dramatically.""

The bill approving the three new highway systems and tolls was passed by the state legislature on a 37-1 vote in the State Senate and on a 76-36 vote in the State House of Representatives. The office of State Sen. Lizbeth Benacquisto (R-Fort Myers) and State Rep. Raymond Rodrigues (R-Fort Myers) did not return messages seeking comment. Both members voted to approve the highway bills.

The state will be holding public meetings on the projects, with the closest meeting to here in the next month taking place Jan. 30 in Arcadia at the Turner Agri-Civic Center Exhibit Hall from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m."," Threaten, not specified below",3

5637,a637da7df75d59f46a701ff6c4fb296e,"Police around the country continued to clamp down on the illegal sale of fireworks with at least 60 fines issued in the Northern Cape for this offence on New Year’s Eve alone.





Police spokesperson, Mohale Ramatseba, says roughly R 250 000 worth of fireworks were confiscated in raids conducted in Kimberley, Hartswater, Warrenton and Pampierstad on 31 December 2019. The fines issued to street vendors range from R 1500 to R 2500.

This comes on the back of the search and seizure raid conducted in Eersterust in Pretoria, after community members informed police officers, a particular shop was selling fireworks to children, “as young as seven years-old”. Gauteng police spokesperson, Mathapelo Peters, reveals when police went to check in on the shop in question at the beginning of the week, they “found fire crackers displayed next to flammable items and not properly stored as per legal requirements”. Peters says it was later determined the trader was in fact selling the fireworks illegally as he did not have a licence to do so.

North West police cautioned the public the use of fireworks in South Africa is governed by the Explosives Act, 1956 and the different bylaws as enforced by the different municipalities in the country. Police spokesperson, Mohale Ramatseba did stress the rules that apply to all, specifically, it being “unlawful for any person to use or explode any firework: Within 500 meters of any explosives magazine, explosives factory, petroleum depot or gasometer. In any building or any public thoroughfare. In any other public place or resort, except with the prior written permission of the local authority”.

Seoul (AFP) |

The North has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests.

A self-imposed ban on such tests — Kim declared they were no longer needed — has been at the centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the last two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump, but little tangible progress.

Analysts said the declaration amounted to Kim putting a missile “to Donald Trump’s head” — but that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim’s “promise” to him not to carry them out, and has played down launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February, and the North set the US an end-of-year deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a “new way”.

“There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,” the official KCNA news agency cited Kim telling top ruling party officials.

“The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,” he added.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers’ Party — an indication of a major policy shift — and the KCNA report came ahead of Kim’s annual New Year speech, a key moment in the North Korean political calendar, reviewing the past and setting out goals for the future.

It will be Kim’s eighth such address, after he revived the tradition started by his grandfather — North Korea’s founding leader Kim Il Sung — but discontinued during his father’s rule.

Kim made clear to party officials that the North was willing to live under international sanctions to preserve its nuclear capability.

“The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,” KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had “conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop” and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said, and stepped up sanctions against the North.

“We can never sell our dignity,” he added, saying Pyongyang would “shift to a shocking actual action to make (the US) pay for the pains sustained by our people”.

– ‘Geopolitical chicken’ –

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up.

“North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump’s head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,” said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

“Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,” he added.

“He is gambling that threatening another demonstration of his ability to hit the US homeland with a nuclear weapon will somehow push America into granting more concessions.”

But the strategy was unlikely to be effective, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with “more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump’s Twitter account”.

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carried out a long-range missile test.

At the weekend Trump’s National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said the administration would be “extraordinarily disappointed and we’ll demonstrate that disappointment”.

“We have a lot of tools in our toolkit, and additional pressure can be brought to bear on the North Koreans,” he said.

An ICBM launch would also be likely to frustrate China, the North’s key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own back yard.

But ties between Pyongyang and Beijing have warmed markedly in the past two years, with Chinese President Xi Jinping paying his first visit to the North as head of state in June, and Beijing and Washington at loggerheads over trade and other issues.

In December China and Russia — another key economic partner for the North — proposed loosening UN sanctions against Pyongyang, and analysts say Kim is likely to seek to exploit rivalries between Washington, Beijing and Moscow.

This would be highly unusual, as such attacks in Somalia are usually carried out by home-grown terrorist organization al-Shabab.

""We have submitted to the national authorities an initial report indicating that the massacre of Somali people in Mogadishu on December 28, 2019, was planned by a foreign country,"" NISA wrote on Twitter.

On Saturday, the city was rocked by its deadliest bombing in more than two years, when nearly 100 people were killed as a result of the explosionat the busy Ex-Control checkpoint in the northwest of Mogadishu. A further 150 victims were taken to local hospitals to be treated for injuries.

Al-Shabab, a al-Qaeda linked Islamist extremist group that has been carrying out an armed insurrection in Somalia since 2006, usually claims responsibility for these kind of attacks, but it has said nothing about the bombing as of Monday.

On Sunday, US Africa Command, in coordination with the Somali government, launched a series of airstrikes against al-Shabab targets, saying afterward that ""four terrorists"" had been killed.

Two-year surge in al-Shabab violence

Although the extremist group has been active for over a decade, in the past two years the situationhas become increasingly violent.

In October 2017, the deadliest attack in the country's history left 512 people dead and around 295 injured in Mogadishu.

The al-Shabab group was forced out of Mogadishu several years ago but continues to target high-profile areas such as checkpoints and hotels. Two weeks ago, the extremist outfit attacked a hotel popular with politicians, army officers and diplomats, killing five people.

Somalia has suffered through violent conflict since 1991, after clan warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other.

In recent months, the government has claimed that the security situation has improved, with increased security personnel and surveillance.

New Indian Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said on Wednesday that the Army will focus on the border with China with equal attention as it does on the Pakistan border.

He exuded confidence that India will “eventually resolve” the border issue with China.

“We have the Line of Actual Control. The border question (with China) is yet to be settled. We have made progress in maintaining peace and tranquility. We will be able to set the stage for an eventual solution,” General Naravane said after the Indian Army presented him a Guard of Honour.

Taking a tough stand on Pakistan and the terror it sponsors, General Mukund Naravane, who succeeded General Bipin Rawat as the 28th Chief of Army Staff on Tuesday, said that in such a situation, India “reserves the right to preemptively strike at the sources of terror”.

He further stated that India has land borders with the two countries and both are equally important.

The Army chief said that “while a lot of attention has been paid to the western front in the past, the northern front also requires equal attention”.

“It is in that context that we are now going in for capability development even in the northern borders, which includes the north-east parts of our country,” said General Naravane, who earlier headed the Army’s Eastern Command, that takes care of India’s nearly 4,000-km border with China.

About India’s border with Pakistan and threats from across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, General Naravane said, “Whatever threats we have, we keep analysing. This is a continuous process where we analyse threats and act accordingly.”

On force modernisation, he said that “modernisation is one of the key and priorities area”. “We have a long term perspective plan based on the analysis of likely threat. These threats keep changing and we change our perspective plan.”

General Naravane also said that special attention will be given to the issues of human rights and added that the Indian Army is battle-hardened and capable of facing all challenges.

“Our priority will be to be operationally prepared at all times,” he said.

“मैं समस्त देशवासियों को आश्वस्त करता हूँ कि हमारी सशस्त्र सेनाएं हर चुनौती के लिए हमेशा तैयार हैं और हम देश के दामन पर कोई आँच नहीं आने देंगे। देशवासियों को नए साल और नए दशक की शुभकामनाएं”। -जनरल मनोज मुकुंद नरवणे#सेनाध्यक्ष#IndianArmy सम्मान गारद के अवसर पर 1 जनवरी 2020 pic.twitter.com/MDecVIKdgK — ADG PI – INDIAN ARMY (@adgpi) January 1, 2020

General Naravane has served in numerous command and staff appointments in peace, field and highly active counter-insurgency environments in Jammu and Kashmir and the northeast in his 37 years of service.

He had assumed charge as Vice Chief of the 1.3 million-strong Army on September 1 last year.

In a distinguished military career spanning almost four decades, the General has the distinction of holding key command and staff appointments in peace and field both in the northeast and Jammu & Kashmir and has been part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka.

Email Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin Comment

An Islamic State terrorist faction in West Africa claims it killed 11 Christian aid workers in Nigeria in retaliation for the killings of IS leader Bakr al-Baghdadi and his spokesman in two separate U.S. military operations earlier this year.

The terrorist group known as the Islamic State in West Africa Province released a 56-second video published by the IS propaganda media arm Amaq that shows the shooting of one man followed by the beheading of 10 others.

Jihadists wearing black masks and beige uniforms lined up behind the hostages — who were all blindfolded — as they carried out the executions, according to those who've watched the video.

“This message is to the Christians in the world,” a man speaking over the video footage says in both Arabic and Hausa, a Nigerian language, said the Washington-based SITE Intelligence Group, according to The New York Times which also reviewed the video. “Those who you see in front of us are Christians, and we will shed their blood as revenge for the two dignified sheikhs, the caliph of the Muslims, and the spokesman for the Islamic State, Sheikh Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, may Allah accept them.”

The terrorist group's attack on Christians the day after Christmas was strategically planned, terrorism analysts told the BBC.

While the location of the execution hasn't been made public, Reuters reports that an earlier video indicated that ISWAP jihadists took the men hostage in “Maiduguri and Damaturu in Nigeria’s northeastern state of Borno, where militants have been fighting for years to set up a separate Islamist state.”

“In that video, the captives pleaded for the Christian Association of Nigeria and President Muhammadu Buhari to save them,” Reuters added.

Buhari condemned the terrorist group and their killings in a statement and series of posts on Twitter.

""We should, under no circumstance, let the terrorists divide us by turning Christians against Muslims because these barbaric killers don't represent Islam and millions of other law-abiding Muslims around the world,"" he said in a statement.

In a message on Twitter Friday, Buhari added, “These agents of darkness are enemies of our common humanity and they don’t spare any victim, whether they are Muslims or Christians, and therefore, we shouldn’t let them divide us and turn us against one another.”

ISWAP split from the terrorist group Boko Haram in 2016 and declared its allegiance to IS. The group is also active in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Mali.

Earlier this month, The Christian Post reported that over 1,000 Christians have been killed this year in Nigeria as attacks by Fulani extremists continue to plague rural farming communities in the Middle Belt, according to estimates published by the U.K.-based nongovernmental organization Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust.

There was a rise in Fulani extremist attacks in the Kaduna state in 2019 after Christians were accused of a reprisal attack on a Fulani settlement that killed as many as 131 in February.

According to the report, there were “five major attacks” in Kaduna between January and November, which resulted in 500 deaths.

A HART spokesperson told CP that the 1,000 death estimation counts “predominantly people killed in Plateau, Southern Kaduna and Taraba states by Fulani herdsmen” but also includes killings by Boko Haram in Borno state.

The finding comes as a Nigeria-based civil society organization reported that at least 2,400 Christians were killed in Nigeria in 2018.

In July, the international human rights nongovernmental organization Jubilee Campaign sent a report to the International Criminal Court warning that the “standard of genocide has now been reached” in Nigeria. The Jubilee Campaign report highlighted 52 attacks on farming communities.

Some have downplayed the role religion has played in the increasing violence in the Middle Belt, as some say that the violence is part of the decadeslong “herder-farmer” clashes that have escalated since farmers have settled on traditional grazing routes used by the herding communities.

Nigeria is ranked as the 12th-worst nation in the world when it comes to Christian persecution, according to Open Doors USA’s 2019 World Watch List."," Threaten, not specified below",3
6309,d59dea6cbf957cf6a836bc3fbff4354f,"Rwanda National Police (RNP) has arrested three men, who were masquerading as one of their own and defrauding people.

Daniel Ndagijimana, who has been guising as 'Chief Inspector of Police Yves Babu', Christian Ngirimana and Mussa Ndagijimana were paraded to the media on Monday at Remera metropolitan.

Daniel Ndagijimana is said to be the ringleader, having recruited Ngirimana, Mussa and another accomplice still at large, into the scam.

RNP spokesperson, Commissioner of Police (CP) John Bosco Kabera said that the arrest of the trio followed complaints filed by several victims.

At least eight people have since come forward claiming to have been defrauded by the trio.

""Between August and December this year, Police received complaints from several people, who were defrauded with promises of giving them drivers licence, and the name CIP Yves Babu was a common denominator in all the complaints,"" CP Kabera said.

""During investigations, Police managed to apprehend Daniel Ndagijimana, who was impersonating CIP Yves Babu; Ndagijimana provided names of other members of his group including Christian Ngirimana and Mussa Ndagijimana, who were also located and arrested,"" he added.

How they scammed people

Daniel Ndagijimana, who admitted to the crime, said that he started this scam in February this year, when he also recruited his accomplices.

""We would go to different sites where driver's license tests are done, get names of the targets and seek their help with a phone to make an urgent call and in the process you make a flash call on own line so as to get contacts of your target,"" Ndagijimana explained.

He further narrated that with particulars and contacts, they would call their targets posing as Police officers informing them that they had failed the tests but request for money so as to help them get the permit.

""I chose to guise as CIP Yves Babu because on most sites where we went, he would be there supervising the driving licence tests, which would sound real in the ears of our targets,"" Ndagijimana said.

According to Ndagijimana, he got help from Mussa to acquire CIP Yves Babu's SIM-card, which is one of the SIM-cards they were using to defraud different people.

""We used four SIM-cards for four different people,"" said Ndagijimana. Although Mussa denied knowing Ndagijimana and Ngirimana, the later said that he introduced him (Mussa) to the former and helped them to acquire SIM-cards for different people including the one of CIP Yves Babu.

According to Ndagijimana, most of their victims were targeted in Gasabo, Nyagatare, Bugesera, Gicumbi and Huye districts. At least Rwf800, 000 was conned from five people in Gasabo and Gicumbi districts, he said.

One of the victims from Nduba in Gasabo, who requested not to be named, told the media that Ndagijimana, who called her back in June guising as 'Calixte Twagiramungu', defrauded her of Rwf300,000.

""I first sent him Rwf250, 000 on Mobile Money and Rwf50, 000 later when he sent me a message that my driver's license was ready for pick-up and requested to be refunded the money he used to declare it. I got to know that I was conned when the same message was sent to many other people, some of them my friends,"" she said.

Another victim identified as Jean de la Croix Mushimiyimana also said that he was defrauded of Rwf95,000 and his two other friends conned of combined Rwf250,000.

Mushimiyimana said he sold his calf so as to raise the money, which has since brought conflicts with his wife.

Kabera cautioned members of the public, who ""take criminal shortcuts"" ending up falling prey.

""Many people have been scammed through different tricks. We remind the public that the whole process of acquiring a driver's licence is done individually... anyone telling you that he will help you, either calling themselves Police officers, are trying to defraud you and should be reported on 997 (Anti-corruption toll-free line) or other known Police communication channels,"" CP Kabera said.

The driver of the tanker sustained burn injuries after the tanker caught fire. He was taken to hospital for medical treatment, he added.

According to police, reports indicate that the sedan with five occupants which was travelling in a northerly direction swerved into the opposite lane (south-bound) and collided head-on with the tanker which was travelling in a southerly direction.

The exact cause of the collision will however be determined through ongoing investigations, Mojapelo said.

New research suggests people in Dorset made their way through more than 1.5 million alcoholic beverages on Christmas Day alone – but Drinkaware is warning residents to keep their consumption in check.

In a survey carried out by the charity, the average UK man admitted knocking back six drinks on Christmas Day, while women said they get through four-and-a-half.

In Dorset, that would equate to a whopping 1,612,331 beverages, using the most recent population estimates from the Office for National Statistics.

If a pint of beer were the universal poison of choice, that would be enough to fill 11,451 bathtubs.

Alternatively, if everybody opted for a medium-sized glass of wine each time they hit the bottle, residents would guzzle down as many litres as the amount of water used to run the average shower for 25 days straight.

Across the South West as a whole, the festivities will see thirsty revellers washing down their Christmas dinners with 23,524,000 drinks – the equivalent of 5.3 Olympic-sized swimming pools of beer.

But the figures could be just the tip of the iceberg, with Drinkaware chief executive Elaine Hindal warning that people in the UK tend to significantly underestimate how much they drink.

She said: ""The festive season can be a jolly time for some, and a stressful time for others.

""Whether you face juggling families, work and friends with festive celebrations or whether this time of year is particularly tough for you, there can be a number of triggers that make you feel pressured to drink more than you usually do.

“But drinking more than you’re used to can lead to mistakes, regrets and hangovers. In the long run, it can significantly increase your risk of developing a range of diseases if you’re regularly drinking over the recommended weekly 14 units a week.

“Keeping track of your drinks and staying in control will help you to enjoy everything December has to offer.”

The poll also found that one in five people feel pressured to drink on Christmas Day, and 13% say they avoid social occasions over the festive period because of the pressure.

Drinkaware recommends drinking water and eating when consuming alcohol, having at least three alcohol-free days a week, and avoiding drinking in rounds."," Threaten, not specified below",3

He said 2020 categorised a year where there will be a lots of political shaking among the leaders of Nigeria, which he summed up as ‘palm-up, palm-down’.

He said: “This year (2020), rapid prayer is needed against national, economic, and political oblivion.”

“A year when the Lord shall dash into pieces the kingdom of wicked rulers. It will be a year of ups and downs. It’s what you can call a ‘palm-up, palm-down’. A palm-up is for receiving while palm-down is for losing,” he said.

The cleric cautioned the youths to stay away from all forms of sexual perversion as God would be sanctioning all perpetrators of this unwholesome acts.

6710,1be95eeae096300d435d495f0f0bd5f7,"Celebrity doctor Christian Jessen has continued to use his social media accounts since he was threatened with legal action after tweeting an unfounded rumour about DUP leader Arlene Foster nine days ago.

Several individuals, who Mrs Foster intends on suing for libel, have been identified by her legal team. Television presenter Dr Jessen is among this group after receiving a warning of impending High Court action.

The tweet, which was posted on Monday, December 23, is still viewable and has been retweeted 500 times.

The day after Dr Jessen posted the tweet, media lawyer Paul Tweed, who is acting for Mrs Foster, replied: ""I am putting Dr Christian Jessen on notice in relation to a totally false allegation he has tweeted regarding DUP leader and former NI First Minister, Arlene Foster.

""Legal action will also be taken against any persons who have retweeted this highly defamatory allegation.""

In a follow-up statement, he added: ""I would confirm, if necessary, legal proceedings will be taken against Dr Christian Jessen, Twitter and any persons who have recklessly retweeted this false and highly defamatory allegation.""

Dr Jessen, who is best known for presenting Channel 4 programmes Embarrassing Bodies and Supersize v Superskinny, appears to have ignored the warning by Mr Tweed.

Since his post regarding Mrs Foster was published, Dr Jessen has sent over 40 other tweets.

Responding to one Twitter user, who said Dr Jessen's supporters will start a funding campaign in order to avoid paying any court fees out of his own pocket, the doctor sent a smiling emoji.

Meanwhile, another Twitter user had directly tagged Mrs Foster into a post stating that Mr Tweed's tweet had made Dr Jessen's post even more popular.

Replying to that on Christmas Day, Dr Jessen wrote ""lol"" (laugh out loud), which was liked over 340 times and generated a number of other responses. He also retweeted a post linked to Mr Tweed's High Court warning.

Mrs Foster has previously been the target of abuse on social media. In July a man was jailed for targeting her and Conservative MP Priti Patel. In the wake of the case the Fermanagh and South Tyrone MLA called for social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to do more and said the abuse she received had left her children very upset.

Mrs Foster said she had stopped looking at social media because of the level of trolling directed at her.

""The internet is a very dark place,"" she said.

""Obviously it has brought a lot of good in that everyone is connected nowadays, but it also brings out the worst in some people.""

Mrs Foster's DUP colleague Carla Lockhart MP has also been repeatedly targeted for abuse on social media.

A campaign calling on the Prime Minister not to scrap the Department for International Development has reached nearly 30,000 signatures in just two weeks.

The DfID works to end extreme poverty and, over its 22 years in existence, has saved millions of lives.

One of its two UK HQs is Abercrombie House in Hairmyres, but its future is now under threat after Boris Johnson announced a radical overhaul of Whitehall.

The Prime Minister plans to abolish departments, sack a third of the cabinet, and reform how civil servants are hired.

It is understood DfID – which employs around 600 people in East Kilbride – will be absorbed by the foreign office.

Linda Fabiani MSP has written to the Secretary of State for Scotland requesting clarity over the future of East Kilbride’s Department for International Development (DfID).

This follows newly elected Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s announcement that he is planning a radical overhaul of Whitehall, with plans to abolish departments, sack a third of the cabinet and reform how civil servants are hired.

Work has begun by Number 10 on abolishing or merging several departments.

Plans are reportedly being drawn up to merge the Department for International Trade and the business department, while the DfID (pictured) will be absorbed by the foreign office.

In protest, nearly 30,000 people have signed an ActionAid petition to save the department, which employs around 600 people at its East Kilbride headquarters in Abercrombie House, Hairmyres and produces £30million for the local economy.

The international anti-poverty organisation say rather than building a ‘global Britain’ it could see aid being spent on trade, defence and commercial interests, undoing the UK’s place as a positive leader on the international stage and turning our back on those who need help most.

Ms Fabiani highlights that this latest jobs blow comes in the wake of a campaign to keep thousands of tax jobs in East Kilbride after HMRC announced plans to relocate nearly 3000 posts to a regional office in Glasgow by 2026.

‘Stay in EK’ predicts over £2m could be lost in the local retail and hospitality sector alone, with over 400 jobs at risk in the East Kilbride area as a result of the closure.

In her letter, Ms Fabiani wrote: “I write regarding recent reports that the intended ‘Whitehall Overhaul’ by your Government will result in the Department for International Development (DfID) being incorporated by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).

“I have written to you previously about your Government’s decision to centralise the HMRC offices in Scotland, and the intention to close down the long-standing facilities in East Kilbride with the loss of much expertise and many jobs to the town. I hope that you are considering the information contained in the Impact Assessment carried out by South Lanarkshire Council.

“As you will be aware, Abercrombie House in East Kilbride is a principal DfID location in the UK, and the reports of further potential losses of Civil Service jobs are causing concern to employees and local residents.

‘As well as potential redundancy, relocation and the effects on individuals and the town generally, there is also worry that the excellent work carried out by DfID could be compromised. I would therefore be interested to know your Government’s intention regarding DfID generally; Scotland of course contributes proportionately to the global development and humanitarian work carried out by the Department.”

The MSP also asked for assurances that a “robust case” will be put forward by the Secretary of State to maintain the civil service jobs, currently based in DfID in East Kilbride, within East Kilbride.

Mr Johnson is expected to make a minor reshuffle next week, before making wholesale changes in February, which could include one-in-three cabinet members moved on.

The changes are also reported to include reform of how civil servants are recruited.

They would make it easier for high-ranking positions to be filled by external experts, instead of lifelong civil servant mandarins.

The DfID has led the world in tackling Ebola, gender inequality, the crisis in Syria and the provision of lifesaving aid in emergencies.

6840,fe258947646be335cafe41f532f63c30,"It has been a year since a pro-gun, anti-indigenous far-right former army captain took power in Brazil and began sending shockwaves through the country’s government and society.

In those 12 months, Jair Bolsonaro – who is openly homophobic and allied to Brazil’s hardline religious right – has declared war on film-makers, journalists and the environment; put a conspiracy theorist in charge of the foreign service; and greenlit a new era of police repression and rainforest destruction.

Here, six prominent Brazilian voices from the arts, media, diplomacy and the Amazon offer their thoughts on Bolsonaro’s dramatic first year as president.

“It has been such a tough year – above all when it comes to public security. We feel really afraid of the intensifying repression of the black population and the increasing militarisation of the favelas. The number of black people being murdered in poor communities has increased, as has the number of indigenous leaders being killed.

“But it’s important to remember how many people have resisted and how many [resistance] movements exist.

“If there’s a positive side to this government, it’s that issues of race and gender have never been talked about so much. This is now a mainstream debate in a country like Brazil – a country founded on the myth of racial democracy that denied the existence of racism for so long. This debate already existed. But now people are discussing and speaking out about these issues like never before.

“Bolsonaro has thrown wide open things that social movements have been talking about for centuries and people are starting to wake up. In 2020, the struggle goes on.”

“This year confirmed our worst fears about the Bolsonaro government’s relationship with the press. We’ve seen it take an increasingly hostile stance, not just towards journalists but also critical and independent media outlets.

“There hadn’t been any kind of censorship since the end of the military dictatorship [in 1985] – and now we’ve started to see a gradual erosion of freedom of expression. The other day I was talking to Nicaraguan and Venezuelan colleagues and they told me: ‘Four years ago, we were going through exactly what you’re going through. This is how it begins.’

“Every time you write a critical piece, you become a target for Bolsonaro supporters. I’d never been a target before – even when covering conflicts. I didn’t even feel like a target in Syria. But here, it’s personal.

“The aggressive messages and the fake news never stop. This is our new normal – especially for female journalists. I’ve become used to being called a whore. Each time I’m about to publish an article that’s critical of the government, I prepare myself because I know the next day will be hell.”

“The last time I felt ashamed of Brazil was in the late 1960s.

“I was going up the escalators near the London School of Economics and I opened a magazine and it had a story about a Brazilian student who had been killed and tortured by the dictatorship. I had the impression everyone on the underground was looking at me.

“Now, again, I feel ashamed – for many reasons, but especially by what is being done in foreign policy. In 50 years I’ve never seen anything like what is happening in Brazilian diplomacy today. Not even during the military government.

“Terrible things happened back then in Brazil. But our diplomacy was more skilful, more cautious and sought dialogue whenever possible. Now it has embarked upon an all-out ideological war against everything that is not western or Christian – according to their conception.

“I feel sorry for my colleagues in the foreign service because I know some of them are being forced to do what they do because it’s their only job.

“It’s not very different from the US state department under Trump – only more exaggerated, more ridiculous. And of course Trump has 4,000 nuclear weapons – he can do whatever he wants.”

“The way the president is behaving is disastrous. So for me, this has been a disappointing year given the positive expectations I had before the elections.

“There are two different people: Captain Jair Bolsonaro is someone I highly respect [and] miss greatly… But President Jair Bolsonaro is a disappointment for the way he has betrayed his country and much of what he promised in the campaign.

“He started to see himself as a some sort of mythological entity, blessed by God. He became extremely arrogant and wouldn’t listen to anyone.

“You can agree with him about 99 things. But if you disagree on one and argue or try to offer another point of view, you are seen as a traitor. His administration became a sect of fanatics – and I’m not a fanatic.

“[Bolsonaro] is surrounded by radicals [and] is scared of everything. He is constantly afraid of being betrayed. That’s why he’s aggressive. He’s scared of journalists. He is scared of politicians.”

“Indigenous people in Brazil feel a lot more fear under this president. This year, many illegal miners have entered our land. They pollute our rivers and kill our fish. Our people are starting to get malaria again.

“Bolsonaro is a garimpeiro [illegal miner]. He wants more land and fewer Indians. After he took power in January, he attacked us and said he no longer wants to recognise indigenous reserves. “He calls us lazy and says we produce nothing. That’s exactly the argument the illegal miners use.

“I don’t know the president personally, but I don’t like what I hear of him on TV and read in the newspaper. He thinks in a military way. The military doesn’t care about the land or indigenous people.

“That is bad for him and bad for us because he is president. He sets the direction of Brazil.

“In our culture, we don’t damage the river and trees. We care for the forest. But the miners just bring destruction. Who is getting rich from this? It’s not regular Brazilians in the cities. It’s politicians who are selling the wealth of Brazil to foreigners.

“I hope people outside can understand this and help us to defend ourselves and preserve nature.”

“For Brazilian cinema, 2019 represented a gigantic pause. Nothing advanced. Everything was suspended. This is a massive loss for an industry that employed more than 300,000 people. It’s not just a cultural loss, it’s an economic loss too. So many families no longer have a way of supporting themselves.

“The new government admits it wants to filter the content being produced with public money. But Brazil’s constitution outlaws censorship. You can’t decide which films can and can’t be made with public funds. There’s a committee responsible for selecting projects according to artistic qualities, the artists involved, the producer – not the themes being portrayed.

“I think it’s an attempt to restrict the content of films. But our country is still a democracy where things work in a certain way. No leader – a mayor, a governor, or president – has the right to impose their personal tastes on the entire population.

“It makes no sense to obstruct a major industry that creates tax revenues, jobs and helps promote the name of our country around the world.

“I don’t know if it’s about Bolsonaro’s tastes, how he sees things or the people in his government. But he himself has said the government wants to control what will be made and what won’t – and this is censorship.”", Torture,3

ST. LOUIS — Five people were killed and five others were injured in shootings in St. Louis less than 12 hours into 2020.

In just the first three hours of the new year, four people were fatally shot and five other people were injured in St. Louis, police said.

Fewer than 10 minutes into 2020, officers were called to the area of Lotus and Euclid avenues in north St. Louis where a male teenager was shot in the upper leg. He was expected to be OK.

About 10 minutes later, police responded to the intersection of S. Jefferson Avenue and Crittendon Street in the city's Benton Park neighborhood. When they arrived, they found three people fatally shot. One other person was shot in the leg.

The victims' ages and genders were not provided.

A red Dodge Charger surrounded by police tape was stopped on Crittendon St. facing west. A dark-colored SUV was stopped on a nearby sidewalk.

Just before 2 a.m., police responded to the 3400 block of Wyoming Street, southeast of Tower Grove Park. One man in his early 20s was shot in the leg and is expected to survive, police said.

At 2:41 a.m., a man was fatally shot in the 5400 block of Genevieve Ave. on the city's north side. Another man who was conscious and breathing was taken to a St. Louis hospital, police said.

6877,13f71bf5509d918002be4eb33c7875d7,"The U.S. and German ambassadors to Poland have taken to social media to defend Warsaw in its spat with Russia over who was to blame for starting World War II.

German envoy Rolf Nikel and U.S. Ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher both said on December 30 that Germany and the Soviet Union colluded to start the war in 1939 that led to the death of tens of millions of people on continental Europe.

""Dear President [Vladimir] Putin,"" Mosbacher said, Adolf Hitler of Germany and Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union ""colluded to start WWII.""

She said, ""that is a fact"" and that ""Poland was a victim of this horrible conflict.""

Nikel said his government’s position was clear: ""the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact served to prepare the criminal invasion of Nazi Germany against Poland. The USSR together with Germany participated in this brutal division of Poland.""

Their statements on social-media came after Putin blamed Poland for provoking the start of the war in which 6 million Poles were killed, or 17 percent of the country’s pre-war population.

The Soviet Union suffered an estimated 20 million war deaths, half of whom were civilians, representing some 11 percent of its population.

The verbal brawl over the competing historical narratives reignited on December 19 when Putin at a news conference denied that the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union was sealed in preparation for war.

EU Resolution

Earlier, in September, he denounced a European Parliament resolution that concluded the Soviet Union bore partial responsibility for WWII, alongside Germany.

The EU resolution said the pact set out to divide Europe ""between the two totalitarian regimes"" of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

Putin dismissed the resolution as ""sheer nonsense.""

Instead the Russian president said Poland was culpable for the outbreak of World War II, words that Russia's Foreign Ministry also repeated in December.

In response, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki issued a four-page statement accusing Putin of ""deliberately"" lying about the start of WWII in an effort to deflect international pressure over Moscow’s actions, both domestic and foreign.

""President Putin has lied about Poland on numerous occasions, and he has always done it deliberately,"" Morawiecki said. ""It usually happens in a situation when the authorities in Moscow feel international pressure caused by its actions. And this pressure is not on the historical stage but on the modern geopolitical scene.""

New York’s Jewish community has been more tense these past two weeks than in a generation, with people being randomly assaulted and taunted on a daily basis.

It was on this backdrop that an African-American man stepped into the home of a rav in Monsey and proceeded to stab people who were there to attend a Chanukah licht event. Five Yidden were hospitalized in stable condition, though one was listed in critical condition.

The attacker, wielding a machete, entered the home of Rav Chaim Leibish Rottenberg, known as the Forshay Rebbe, at about ten o’clock on Motzaei Shabbos and began stabbing. A member of the kehillah, Elya Glick, lifted a small table and threw it at him, disorienting the assailant long enough to chase him out. The suspect attempted to go into the Forshay shul next door to continue his stabbing spree, but those inside bolted the doors.

The attacker then fled in a silver car, but not before he ran back to the rav’s house and yelled at Glick, “Hey, you, I’ll get you!” He was captured by NYPD officers in Harlem, about a half hour away from Rockland County.

The attack caps a week that saw a record nine anti-Semitic attacks in the five boroughs. And it comes a month after a still-unsolved incident in which a Jewish man was nearly stabbed to death in Monsey, and two weeks after the Jersey City terrorist attack that killed three people.

The new feeling in New York’s Jewish neighborhoods, which until recently had been considered the safest in the city, is apprehension and anxiety, as parents wonder what to answer children who ask about their safety. While Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted their solidarity, and the mayor promised to beef up patrols around shuls, the new conversation topic among children is how many police cars they can spot.

Hovering above this strained atmosphere is a law going into effect January 1, which bars judges from holding suspects on bail for a variety of crimes, including assault as a hate crime.

Prosecutors have already begun implementing this legislation, despite a consensus among the state’s law enforcement agencies that it will cause crime stats to rise dramatically. Already, a female who slapped three Jewish women in Brooklyn last week has been released without bail.

Members of the Monsey community wondered about the statement by Rockland County Executive Ed Day, whose own harsh rhetoric against Jews is seen as contributing to the hate. Day condemned the “heinous attack,” but did not mention that it targeted Jews. His police chief said there was insufficient evidence to show it was a hate crime.

The FBI arrived at the scene early Sunday, and the NYPD’s hate crime task force said it was closely following the investigation.

The quick arrest allayed immediate fears in the community, several local residents said, but the escalation in anti-Semitic acts is spooking them.

“Any suggestions,” asked Shoshana Bernstein, who lives nearby, “on how I tell my 11-year-old son there was a stabbing around the corner, without shattering his innocence?”

They made this declaration via a statement signed by ALGON Chairman, Prince Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye, a copy of which was made available to DAILY POST in Ibadan on Tuesday.

DAILY POST recalls that Makinde had in May shortly after his inauguration asked the Chairmen who were elected during the administration of the immediate past Governor, Mr. Abiola Ajimobi to hand over the property of their respective councils to the most senior officers in the areas.

ALGON led by Abass-Aleshinloye approached a court of law with an argument that they were illegally sacked.

Abass-Aleshiloye and Secretary of the association, Pastor Jesutoye Oluyinka had on Monday warned the newly inaugurated Local Council chairmen in the state against engaging in any transaction on behalf of their respective councils.

In the letter addressed to the chairman, bankers to local government councils and Local Council Development Authority (LCDAs), Heads of Local Government Administration and staff, ALGON said it decided to issue the warning in order not to be complicit in the illegal actions because of the repercussions.

But, the ALGON Chairman in a new year message to the people of the state, insisted that they still remained in office by the provision of the law which they said was supreme.

Abass-Aleshiloye said, “Oyo ALGON admonishes the people of the state to remain united and appreciate God for giving us a beautiful state endowed with enormous resources and boundless opportunities.

“As we usher in the year 2020, it is time for us to reflect on the last twelve months and to look forward to new beginnings. As a people we appreciate God for giving us a beautiful state endowed with enormous resources and boundless opportunities.

“Yes, 2019 was quite challenging to most of us , particularly on the rape on our democracy(at the grassroots level) on the purported dissolution of the local government council and local council areas but we remain grateful to God for helping us to weather the storm and keeping us to see yet another year.

“The path to the future is replete with challenges, but we remain resolute, we would overcome the challenges of today with the same resilience and indomitable spirits that have continued to inspire us throughout history.

“We stand fast on our mandate freely and fairly given by the good people of our respective local government and development areas, and undertake to remain peaceful even in the face of extreme threats and provocation by the Government of Oyo State. We remain in office by law and the law is supreme.

“We reaffirm our confidence in the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary to uphold the Supreme Court and the Oyo State High Court subsisting judgement against illegal dissolution of Councils.

“In conclusion, the good news is that we have taken off already on this journey of hope, and with God helping us, we shall surely succeed. I wish you a happy and bountiful New Year and pray for God’s peace on you and your family.”

Police said the accused Santoshi Yeshwant Shende hurled 'desi bombs' at them when they went to arrest him. However, they nabbed him with the help of 18 officers from the Palghar Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), bomb disposal force and local police.

Police said, Shende was jailed after his wife had filed a domestic violence case against him three years ago. He got out on bail after his friend Narayn Bendga submitted a surety bond in court on his behalf.

However, Shende started skipping court hearings, after which the judge sent summons to Bengda. Fed up, Bengda withdrew the surety amount earlier this month. When Shende learnt about this, he became furious and assaulted Bendga on December 18.

Bengda then approached the Vikramgadh police and filed a complaint and the police registered a case under section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). They then went to Shende's home to arrest him, but Shende hurled 'desi bombs' at them and fled, a police officer.

The officer said after December 18, Shende had allegedly attacked several passersby too, suspecting them to be the police.

The Vikramgadh police then sought help of assistant police Inspector Mansingh Patil, ATS in-charge in Palghar. Patil met Palghar superintendent of police, Gaurav Singh, and formed a team of officers, and sniffer dogs to nab Shende.

""We went to his house again on Tuesday morning and surrounded it from all sides. The accused threw a gelatin bomb at us, and was preparing to throw more bombs, when we barged into his house and nabbed him,"" Patil said.

During the investigation, the police learnt that Shende was a member of a labour union and had earlier done some mining work, where he is suspected to have learnt bomb-making using gelatin stick.

""We have booked him under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) and 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful appre­hension) of the IPC and various sections of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908,"" Patil said.

In a statement on Friday, Abdulrazaq’s Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaiye, the Kwara Governor revoked a land occupied by Saraki’s family in Ilorin, adding that the land was originally meant for government secretariat and parking space of a clinic.

But in a statement, Saraki who once governed the state, insisted the land was duly allocated and a Right of Occupancy title issued on it.

Saraki claimed that Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, is out for vengeance against his family."," Threaten, not specified below",3
7208,51daed036d047a7f57c2b054782d383b,"This year has not been an easy one for England’s royal family. Prince Philip has been in the hospital multiple times, Prince William and Prince Harry seem to be fighting, and Prince Andrew has been embroiled in a scandal over his involvement with the late sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.

As if all that weren’t enough, there have been storm clouds over Prince William and Kate Middleton — a relationship that has seemed rock-solid up until now. As the new decade begins, has Duchess Kate been able to forgive her husband for the hurtful stories and embarrassment?

Rumors of Prince William having an affair

In the spring of 2019 rumors started to circulate about Duchess Kate’s longtime friend, Rose Hanbury. The story was that Middleton and Prince William had cut ties with Hanbury and her husband, David Rocksavage.

The two couples had been very close at once, but apparently that wasn’t the case any longer, and the tabloids were sure they knew why. People quickly assumed that the rift was caused by an affair between Prince William and Hanbury, and soon the media was abuzz with speculation about what happened when.

The British tabloids are infamous for their relentless hounding of the royal family, and the relationship between them is strained at best. However, there was so much interest in the story that it had to cause the couple a great deal of embarrassment, whether the affair actually happened or not.

Tense times on television

During this upheaval, Duchess and Prince William have given the public very few clues about what might be going on between them. They are famous for being more reserved than the affectionate couple Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, so that makes it harder to see if things have changed between them.

Royal watchers believe they got a glimpse of some tension between the two on a recent television appearance. They were on the set of a holiday special called A Berry Royal Christmas when Prince William reached out to touch Duchess Kate’s shoulder. She appeared to flinch away from his hand, rejecting the touch.

Because the couple is so reserved about showing affection, it’s hard to be certain that the tiny moment revealed anything about their relationship. The Duchess of Cambridge may have only been trying to maintain decorum, not refusing to allow her husband to touch her. She could have also merely been tickled by his touch.

Then again, it could have been what many people assumed it was: an angry wife letting her husband know he’s not yet forgiven.

Moving on with dignity

No one except the couple will ever know for sure how this scandal has played out between the two of them. But from what the public can see, their marriage remains strong.

After all, one of the strengths of their union is how well they function together as a team. From the beginning of their relationship, it was clear how well suited they were for each other.

As the years have progressed, Duchess Kate and Prince William have shown that they are growing into the expectations of them as the future king and queen consort. They not only present a gracious appearance, but they also work well together on important issues. They have thoughtfully honored the memory of Princess Diana, and they tirelessly support important charities.

No one ever wants to deal with the heartbreak of infidelity — even if it’s just the shame of people speculating about the state of their relationship. We don’t have to know exactly what happened to know that this has been a hard year for Prince William and Duchess Kate. While people are certain that the couple will hang in there, fans all over the world are hoping they will be able to be happy together again."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The baby girl was admitted with 70 percent burn injuries at a Jaipur hospital and was on ventilator support. There were 15 infants admitted to the neonatal care unit of the Geetanand hospital in Alwar when the fire broke out in an oxygen pipeline connected to a radiant warmer around 5 am on Tuesday.

The girl, who was being treated for pneumonia, had burn injuries on her face, chest and shoulder, while others were shifted to other units, an official had said. ""The girl has died today,"" JK Lon hospital superintendent Ashok Gupta said.

A Taliban member posing as a police officer helped facilitate an attack that killed nine policemen at a base along the Mazar Sheberghan highway in the province of Balkh late Tuesday, provincial council members Ibrahim Khair Andish and Afzal Hadid told the German Press Agency (dpa).

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed that the insurgents in the Balkh attack had infiltrated police ranks from a while ago, waiting for a chance to strike. Though the Taliban often exaggerate their claims, the insurgents also on occasion disguise themselves in Afghan uniforms to get easier access to their targets

In the province of Kunduz, Taliban members attacked at least three checkpoints in Dasht-e Archi overnight, leaving at least 14 dead and six injured, according to provincial council members Safiullah Amiri and Fawzia Yaftali.

In a third attack on Tuesday night, a gunbattle with the Taliban killed seven members of the security forces in Takhar province, according to Jawad Hajri, the provincial governor's spokesman. He said 10 Taliban fighters were also killed. The shootout took place in Darqad district after the security forces had successfully cleared out the Taliban from several other districts in the past week, said Hajri. Fighting was still underway there on Wednesday, he added.

The Taliban hold sway over practically half of Afghanistan, staging near-daily attacks that target soldiers, security forces and government officials but also kill scores of civilians.

Some of the fiercest clashes between the Taliban and the Afghan forces have occurred in the country's north, leaving hundreds dead on both sides over the past year. The latest attacks came as the U.S. and Taliban delegations were discussing a possible reduction in violence in the embattled country. The Taliban rejected earlier media reports that a cease-fire had been agreed upon with the U.S."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

Fatal flight path

Re Blind Spots (Report on Business, Dec. 28): Let me see if I understand the situation correctly. Shortly after a Boeing 737 Max crashed off Indonesia in the fall of 2018, killing all 189 on board, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration conducted a study that statistically demonstrated the aircraft was unsafe. This U.S. regulatory authority did not make its findings public. However, in mid-November of 2018, it provided the results of the damning report to Transport Canada, which also kept this knowledge to itself.

Story continues below advertisement

The failure to disclose crucial public safety information by employees of these two regulatory agencies meant air travellers all over the world were deliberately prevented from knowing the risk involved in flying on a 737 Max and, some five months later, in mid-March, 2019, another one crashed, this time in Ethiopia. A further 157 people were killed, including 18 Canadians.

Not only should those responsible for this negligent or willful omission at the FAA and Transport Canada be fired, they should also be prosecuted.

David Marley West Vancouver, B.C.

With Transport Canada’s apathy, inaction and failure to exercise due diligence laid out for all to see, surely it is now incumbent on Transport Minister Marc Garneau to apologize for the conduct of his department on this file, and to specify the changes in its policies and procedures to ensure this never happens again.

Scott Burbidge Port Williams, N.S.

As I became increasingly infuriated as your report’s details were revealed, it became obvious that, over time, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (whether through lobbying or other time-honoured means of persuasion) had been gamed by Boeing and that Transport Canada (whether through laziness, stinginess or the same time-honoured means) had in turn become a toady of the FAA.

For the FAA to do what amounts to a cost-benefit analysis of inevitable crashes shows just how low that institution has sunk, and for Transport Canada to be complicit in covering this up shows its own descent.

Gerrard Weedon Toronto

My late father, Terry Lyons, and my late uncle, Ken Lyons, were both pilots, with the Canadian Forces and Air Canada, respectively. They always told our family that Canadian safety standards were higher than U.S. standards. This clearly is not true anymore.

Was Transport Minister Marc Garneau afraid to ground the 737 Max? We bowed to the Americans on the Avro Arrow, which my dad was hoping to fly in the 1950s. We bowed to the Americans on taking nuclear warheads in our Bomarc missiles, and we helped train their pilots for service in Vietnam. Lately, it seems we’ve bowed to them on arresting Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on their behalf, and on NAFTA 2.0 by agreeing to let their dairy products enter our stores, and on drug products and patent protections.

Unlocking minds

Re How Can Prisoners Be Rehabilitated Without Proper Access To Education? (Dec. 30): The complete ban on inmate access to the internet is understandable. Many prisoners are incarcerated precisely because they have used the internet to facilitate criminal behaviour, such as viewing and distributing child pornography, perpetrating financial fraud, hacking and so on.

Nevertheless, as it is unlikely that working in a prison cafeteria or laundry will lead to employment for a living wage upon a prisoner’s release, the Correctional Service of Canada should be doing everything in its power to ensure that the incarcerated are educated.

Would it not be fairly simple for it to devise a system whereby prisoners could access university courses on a type of “closed circuit” computer? The CSC could purchase the desired courses and, once reimbursed, make them, but nothing else, available to prisoners. Such a system would no doubt also be of use to those attempting to finish high school, as well as for educating prisoners about emotional and mental issues (effects of growing up in abusive homes, addictions and other maladaptive behaviours, neurological problems and so on). Many of them struggle with these issues for which we are hard-pressed to provide individual therapy.

Anita Dermer Toronto

The article highlights a disturbing reality about Canada’s justice system. It’s not wholly rehabilitative. In fact, effectively denying Canadian prisoners the right to education prevents them from becoming better people. That’s what education does. Learning not only enhances your understanding of the world but also develops moral character.

At the moment, Canada is making it clear, unfortunately, that it believes “bad” people, namely prisoners, are not entitled to that opportunity. What it fails to see is that everyone, in a democratic society, should be guaranteed that.

It doesn’t matter how much someone’s past actions bother you or causes you even to loathe them. Rights are about the dignity of persons, which no crime can ever erase.

The Rhodes behind us

Re University of Cambridge’s Canadian Leader Seeks Justice For The Past – And Finds Controversy (Dec. 17): It has frequently surprised me that the contemporary cohort of university students, motivated as they are by virtue, have not consistently demonstrated against the continued awarding of the Rhodes Scholarship. As foreign correspondent Paul Waldie’s story illustrates, the cash to fund the scholarships, courtesy of Cecil Rhodes, came from the exploitation of Indigenous workers in Africa and should provoke the conscience of anyone receiving it. Is there not a university dean or president somewhere who is ashamed of one of their students accepting such accursed funds?

7377,d4b4930231d30ddbdd489066a8018dd2,"US PRESIDENT DONALD Trump has ordered that some 750 American soldiers be deployed to the Middle East, with about 3,000 more prepared for possible deployment in the coming days following an attack on the US embassy compound in Iraq.

Trump said Iran was “fully responsible” for the attack in which no US casualties or evacuations were reported.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said last night that “in response to recent events” in Iraq, and at Trump’s direction, he had authorised the immediate deployment of the infantry battalion from the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Esper did not specify the soldiers’ destination, but a US official familiar with the decision said they will go to Kuwait.

“This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,” Esper said in a written statement.

Additional soldiers from the 82nd Airborne’s quick-deployment brigade, known officially as its Immediate Response Force, were prepared to deploy, Esper said.

The US official, who provided unreleased details on condition of anonymity, said the full brigade of some 4,000 soldiers may deploy.

‘Big price’

The breach of the embassy compound in Baghdad yesterday revealed growing strains between the US and Iraq, raising questions about the future of Washington’s military mission there.

Trump tweeted yesterday: “They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!”

American airstrikes on Sunday killed 25 fighters of the Kataeb Hezbollahan, an Iran-backed militia in Iraq.

The US said those strikes were in retaliation for last week’s killing of an American contractor and the wounding of American and Iraqi troops in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that the US blamed on the militia.

The American strikes angered the Iraqi government, which called them an unjustified violation of its sovereignty.

“Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many,” Trump tweeted from his estate in Florida.

“We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!”"," Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing, not spec below",3
7382,7dbc4a464187e5dc69779e4416acfd6d,"Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters began marching in Hong Kong on New Year's Day, demanding concessions from the city's embattled government as the civil unrest that convulsed the Chinese-ruled city for over half a year spills into 2020.

""It's hard to utter 'Happy New Year' because Hong Kong people are not happy,"" said a man named Tung, who was walking with his 2-year-old son, mother and niece, as reported by Reuters. ""Unless the five demands are achieved, and police are held accountable for their brutality, then we can't have a real happy new year,"" he added, referring to the push for concessions from the government including full democracy, amnesty for the over 6,500 people arrested so far, and a powerful, independent investigation into police actions.

The pro-democracy march was organized by the Civil Human Rights Front, a group that arranged a number of marches last year that drew millions.

The protests began in June over proposed legislation that could have allowed residents to be extradited to China where they could face possible torture and unfair trials. The legislation was withdrawn, but not before the protests expanded to wider calls for reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Hong Kong toned down its New Year's celebrations amid the protests, which have dealt severe blows to the city's retail, tourism and nightlife sectors.

China's President Xi Jinping said in a New Year's speech that Beijing will ""resolutely safeguard the prosperity and stability"" of Hong Kong under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" framework. Beijing denies interference and blames the West for fomenting the unrest. In July, China issued a stark reminder that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) could be deployed in Hong Kong if city authorities requested support in maintaining ""public order"" after weeks of sometimes violent protests.

More than 2,000 protesters have been injured since June, according to the Hospital Authority. While there is no official count of deaths during the protests, student Chow Tsz-lok died after a high fall during a rally in November. Multiple suicides have been linked to the movement. Police arrested about a dozen protesters over the weekend and used pepper spray to break up a gathering aimed at disrupting retail business near the border with mainland China.

NAIROBI, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday vowed to intensify the fight against corruption.

Kenyatta said during the New Year message to the Nation that his administration will not be deterred in the quest to eradicate graft that is responsible for stifling growth, worsening inequality and undermining national security.

""In 2019, our country's profile continued to soar through the world-beating performances of our sportspeople, improved rankings in the World Bank's ease of doing business index and our fight against corruption,"" Kenyatta said in a televised address to the nation on Tuesday.

He urged citizens to rally behind his clarion call for peace, unity and cohesion to enable his administration to attain a long-term development blueprint.

""This New Year, and the new decade that it begins, present our Nation with tremendous opportunities to foster unity, prosperity, positive social change and deepening of democratic gains and enhancing the rule of law,"" said Kenyatta.

The Kenyan leader has made the fight against corruption part of his frontline agenda as he serves his second and last term in the office.

Experts hailed Kenyatta's latest vow to revitalize the fight against a vice that is responsible for nearly 30 percent loss to Kenya's annual budget.

Gerishon Ikiara, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi's School of Diplomacy, said that corruption is a global problem not restricted to Kenya or China, and stressed that both countries could share lessons, expertise and best practices in eradicating the vice.

""Basically, we must admit that both developed and developing countries are affected by the corruption that has a negative impact on economic growth and worsens inequality,"" said Ikiara.

He lauded President Kenyatta for spearheading the fight against graft, adding that Kenya can draw lessons from China, whose success in the war against the vice has been profound.

""As a country, we need to draw lessons from China... We must admit that for China to reach its levels of development and phenomenal strides in poverty reduction, it is partly because of drastic measures that have been taken to fight corruption,"" said Ikiara.

""The current government in China has taken very drastic measures to fight graft. Kenya and other developing can learn from that example, take stern measures to fight corruption, backed by the constitution,"" said Ikiara.

While noting that Kenya has made some headway in the fight against corruption in arresting corruptive officials, Ikiara said that ""the next step should concentrate on the recovery of stolen funds and channel them to development programs."""," Threaten, not specified below",3

7454,561adcc302cec84a146545b94a5ac28e,"The family of a 4-year-old who was killed in West Valley City returned home Tuesday afternoon.

Police arrested 29-year-old Nicole Lester early Tuesday morning, after she allegedly confessed to a neighbor that she had killed her daughter.



She was held for aggravated murder, but for people living on Losee Drive where it all happened, questions still remain.

“My heart broke when I hear something like this....when I saw that a woman killed her daughter, my god,"" said neighbor Nyandang Deng.

Police said there was a 6-year-old boy asleep inside the house when they arrived at the scene. Neighbors said the tragedy will be hardest for him.



“Growing up, the little boy, the most, will have it hard, remembering the little sister he used to play with is no longer there,"" said Krystalina Myler.

Another neighbor said she was woken up by Lester Tuesday morning, who used her phone to call police, and allegedly confessed to killing her daughter. According to a probable cause affadavit, police found Lester outside her home in bloody clothes after confessing to that neighbor.



Few people in the neighborhood seemed to know the family, but most had seen the girl riding her bike down the street.

“My one daughter said that she had seen the little girl out playing when they would come home from school,"" Myler said. ""Come by, and the little girl is just happy and smiling and like, 'look at this,' and stuff...”

The crime scene tape was removed and police were gone by late Tuesday afternoon, but people in the neighborhood were still processing what had happened just a few doors down.

""You never know what is going through someone’s head or what’s happening in their life,"" Myler said.

7484,b4243bd6465594905f5ab39b3355ee64,"North Korea is abandoning its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, leader Kim Jong-un has declared according to state media on Wednesday.

The North has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been at the centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the last two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump, but little tangible progress.

Analysts said the declaration amounted to Kim putting a missile ""to Donald Trump's head"" -- but that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's ""promise"" to him not to carry them out, and has played down launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February, and the North set the US an end-of-year deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a ""new way"".

He has said that his country would soon introduce a ""new strategic weapon"" in the near future, adding that he sees little reason to stick to his country's suspension of nuclear and

long-range missile tests, he had put in place during talks with the US.

""There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,"" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim telling top ruling party officials.

""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" he added.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party -- an indication of a major policy shift -- and the KCNA report came ahead of Kim's annual New Year speech, a key moment in the North Korean political calendar, reviewing the past and setting out goals for the future.

It will be Kim's eighth such address, after he revived the tradition started by his grandfather -- North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung -- but discontinued during his father's rule.

Kim made clear to party officials that the North was willing to live under international sanctions to preserve its nuclear capability.

""The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,"" KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had ""conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop"" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said, and stepped up sanctions against the North.

""We can never sell our dignity,"" he added, saying Pyongyang would ""shift to a shocking actual action to make (the US) pay for the pains sustained by our people"".

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up.

""North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump's head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,"" said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

""Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,"" he added.

""He is gambling that threatening another demonstration of his ability to hit the US homeland with a nuclear weapon will somehow push America into granting more concessions."" But the strategy was unlikely to be effective, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with ""more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account"".

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carried out a long-range missile test.

At the weekend Trump's National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien said the administration would be ""extraordinarily disappointed and we'll demonstrate that disappointment"".

""We have a lot of tools in our toolkit, and additional pressure can be brought to bear on the North Koreans,"" he said.

An ICBM launch would also be likely to frustrate China, the North's key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own back

yard.

But ties between Pyongyang and Beijing have warmed markedly in the past two years, with Chinese President Xi Jinping paying his first visit to the North as head of state in June, and Beijing and Washington at loggerheads over trade and other issues.

In December, China and Russia -- another key economic partner for the North -- proposed loosening UN sanctions against Pyongyang, and analysts say Kim is likely to seek to exploit rivalries between Washington, Beijing and Moscow.

RAPAPORT... After 16 years of working as a manufacturer — 10 of which he spent as manager of Laurence Graff’s South African business Safdico — Ilan Kaplan decided to “turn on its head all the traditional thinking in the diamond industry.” Together with fellow rough-diamond specialist Ravi Gukin and polished-diamond expert Daniel Feigin, Kaplan founded iSparkle in August 2018 — a lean, mean manufacturing operation that bypasses both contract sales and the credit system. The company specializes in manufacturing rough diamonds 10 carats and up, with the resulting polished larger than 3 carats, and its focus is on better-quality and colored diamonds.



Here, the founder and CEO of the Johannesburg-based business outlines the thinking that led him and his partners to try and disrupt the diamond supply chain.



A rock and an easier place



“Having grown up in a De Beers sightholder entity, I could see that in order to maintain your sight, you are in a fixed-term contract with De Beers, and you are bound at certain times of the year to buy the goods De Beers would offer you, at the price they would offer you. Obviously, some of the time, some of the goods were not worth the price. You are then caught between a rock and a hard place. If you take the goods, you lose money, but if you refuse the goods, you might potentially lose your market share.



“I said to myself, as a diamond industry we’ve got to be more bottom-line and profit-driven as opposed to revenue-driven. The diamond business has always been revenue-driven. Diamond companies want to buy as much as possible to sell as much as possible to show big balance sheets and big revenues to the banks. So I thought, we need to move away from being bound to a single supplier or a group of suppliers with a contract where every single month you have to make the cash available.



“Our position in South Africa gives us a huge advantage. If a big rough comes at a reasonable price or a price we can defend, then we sharpshoot: We jump and we purchase it.

“The logistics company activated the vehicle tracking company when they could not get hold of the truck driver on his mobile phone and suspected the truck had deviated from its authorised route,” said Peters.

“Further investigation led police to a nearby plot in Strydfontein where they found some of the medical supplies that were allegedly offloaded from the truck,” said Peters.

The suspects were arrested on the plot for possession of suspected stolen property.

“The value of the medical supplies is yet to be determined. The arrested suspects will appear before court in due course,” said Peters.

Provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Elias Mawela issued a warning to anyone who intended to collaborate with criminals.

It was plain human courage and it takes your breath away.""

Likewise, the moment UPA-II began unravelling within a year of re-election in 2009, it became clear that India was heading for a change, for a new regime in which there were strong possibilities of Narendra Modi playing a major part. Yet, the first stones thrown at the ruling edifice were not by any of the Sangh parivar affiliates.

Rather, it was the youth which rallied at the call of people like Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal, Prashant Bhushan and Kiran Bedi, tactically showcased by civil society, which rattled the government to the extent of almost delegitimising it. The RSS-BJP sensed the power of youth and backed this movement with RSS handlers of its students’ body, ABVP, mobilising its cadre for this movement.

Although middle classes, too, were mobilised, chiefly students and youth were mainstays of the anti-corruption campaign. The two communities were once again at the forefront of the protests against the horrific gang rape and murder in Delhi in December 2012 which further eroded the moral basis of UPA-II.

With government on a tailspin and the BJP resolving leadership matters by anointing Modi as its electoral mascot, it was clear the BJP-RSS combine was on the rise. After the extraordinary victory in 2014, ideological hegemonisation of India was on expected rise. The emphatic nature of Modi's re-election in 2019 may have surprised some, yet post-Pulwama, the direction of the verdict was never in doubt. With such a massive mandate, deliveries on contentious items on the Hindutva agenda too was on expected lines. From 'whether', it became a matter on 'when' insofar as abrogation of Article 370, Ram temple, triple talaq etc., were concerned.

This makes the return of the students and youth to the streets to protest the citizenship law remarkable. It is extraordinary because it is so close on the heels of the victory which resulted in much despair among BJP's adversaries. Yet, as numerous statements and actions of the regime suggest, there is no strategy of how to counter the opposition to the law. The worry is that the fight against CAA can slowly metamorphose into opposition on wider issues.

The prime minister is certainly aware of the potential of the ongoing agitation. This explains why in quick succession he has reiterated that youth must remain orderly and not resort to violence and anarchy.

First, he stressed on responsibility and duties of citizens. He said that being focussed solely on rights would not suffice. Second, and paradoxically, he lavished praise on youth for taking out their mobile phones to make videos of people who jump queues at cinema ticket counters or at airports. And this, at a time when large sections of students and youths are standing up in solidarity with those who are being singled out! And this, when the two demographic groups are raising national and international solidarity networks to safeguard the Constitution!

But there was a time when Modi did not have to force himself to be avuncular, a role which appeared innovative when he first donned it in 2014 at his first I-Day speech. At that time he sermonised people on matters of cleanliness and respecting women.

But, as prime minister of a government which is facing initial threats of being under siege or getting beleaguered, he has chosen overconfidence and being in denial. That's why he said youth love the system and disagree anarchy. Whereas, spontaneous movements never calculate the cost of rebellion.

This turn to his personality is ironical, for Modi rose in politics through the route of protests and clandestine operations. Would it not be prudent to recollect how he ferried proscribed literature during Emergency? By today's logic, did the twenty five-year-old who dressed himself as a Sikh and secretively ferried George Fernandes to a 'safe house', commit an anti-national act?

In an interview several years ago, when I was researching for his biography, the issue of public protests had come up. ""In democracy the ultimate goal of protest is to spread political awareness or education,"" Modi had said. If these were not adequate advice for today's protestors, there was more to follow: ""This is not the British Sultanate that only agitation will work. It is not necessary that every agitation should be successful... look at Mahatma Gandhi’s life... each agitation he started led to political awareness in a new area. He took it to a certain peak, then came down and rested for a while till the next battle. He would start another agitation and take it to another peak till the eventual goal was reached.""

The Modi of 2012 had no doubt that ""in democracy, the only way is through debate...(that) protest is a legitimate way of raising the voice of the people.""

The practise of debate, right to dissent the value of protest which he espoused once has certainly been forgotten after ascending to power. This leads us to question if what was articulated previously was actually a matter of belief or just a tactical ploy to be seen on the right side of democratic values? Or if tactics, presented as legitimate while in opposition, become unlawful the moment one becomes the 'system'?

There is no knowing how long the current anti-CAA protest can be sustained and if it would acquire a wider character. But there is no denying that this phase of Indian politics has shown that the creative spirit and courage to protest has not got eroded among students and youth. As Modi himself said, it is not necessary for this agitation to reach the desired objective.

What is more significant is that mere participation has politicised large sections of a generation vested with the capacity to catalyse change. In today's era of growing endorsement of majoritarian ideology, even the smallest of expansion in the group dreaming of an inclusive Indian built on the principle of 'unity in diversity', is a net gain for democracy.

Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said although authorities were well-resourced, the massive fire front was impossible to contain.

“It’s not about the number of firefighters — you could have 10,000 fire fighters on each fire we would not be able to get around these fires because where they’re burning is not easy to get to — there are no easy containment lines, we’d have to get earth moving in to try and create containment lines,” Mr Rogers said.

“It isn’t simple to try to get around these fires and that’s why I’m being upfront saying we won’t get around them and Saturday is not looking like it’s going to be a good day at all.

RFS Wollondilly community liaison officer Elizabeth Ellis said residents should be aware the app was dealing with “unprecedented usage” and could experience delays.

“The usage is huge on a daily basis and also the maps in order to be updated they have to come down and be put back up again so there are times when there are momentary glitches where diamonds turn up in funny places or outside the mapped area of the fire,” Ms Ellis said.

“There are unusually some times when the system doesn’t work well — for example the mapping system can’t get fires near me to upload the map. In that instance we make sure we put up local maps on Facebook page to provide information.”

According to the Virginia Beach Fire Department, a call came in at 9:39 p.m. for a single-family residential structure fire. The caller told dispatch that there was a fire in the attached garage, no one was injured and everyone in the house got out safely.

Crews arrived on scene five minutes later to find smoke coming from the house. A working fire was declared, and crews initiated a fire attack.

The fire was contained to the garage — there was no extension into the attic space and slight smoke damage to the living space.

The homeowner was found to have a small burn on his arm, and was exposed to a copious amount of smoke in an attempt to extinguish the fire. He was evaluated and treated by Emergency Medical Services but refused transport.

One firefighter reported an injury following the incident, but refused treatment and remained on duty.

The US embassy in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad was evacuated on Tuesday after thousands of angry demonstrators gathered outside the gates of the compound to condemn Washington’s fatal military strike that targeted Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU).

On Sunday, five facilities run by the Iraqi PMU forces in Anbar province and neighboring Syria were targeted in the attack, which has left casualties, including over a dozen people dead with scores injured.

US officials claimed the attack came in response to a rocket strike on Friday which killed a “US civilian contractor.” They said the attack targeted an Iraqi military base housing US and Iraqi forces in the Arab country’s north.

Washington has accused the Islamic Republic of being behind both the Friday rocket attack as well as anti-US protests in Iraq, accusations which Iran has vehemently rejected.

Meanwhile, the president’s critics put the blame for recent incidents on him, accusing Trump of an erratic Middle East policy that resulted in Tuesday’s scene.

“The attack on our embassy in Baghdad is horrifying but predictable,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) tweeted. “Trump has rendered America impotent in the Middle East. No one fears us, no one listens to us. America has been reduced to huddling in safe rooms, hoping the bad guys will go away. What a disgrace.”

While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tweeted that “Escalation and violence must end,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said, “We need to be clear-eyed about reducing tensions and the path forward.”

For the last decade, Somalia has struggled to assert it's authority due to frequent Al-Shabaab attacks targeting both civilians and security forces.

On Saturday, the country suffered the worst attack in two years, leaving at least 90 people dead and hundreds badly injured.

The US to continue standing with Somalia

Donald Yamamoto, the US envoy to Somalia said the attack was a ""reminder of who the enemies of Somalia are"".

Ambassador Yamamoto added: ""We continue to stand by you, the Somali people, as you honor the lost and fight against the evils of terrorism.”

The international community has continued to stand with Somalia following Saturday's attack, which also destroyed many businesses.

Qatar and Turkey are among the countries that have given direct help through airlifting the injured people for advanced treatment abroad, the Somali government said.

According to Yamamoto “each life is precious and valuable. Each person can help create a more secure, prosperous, and vibrant future for Somalia"".

The US is one of the major partners in Somalia's quest to restore stability and reconciliation. Washington has deployed over 500 elite forces in Mogadishu.

""We are and will remain committed to working towards that goal alongside Somalia’s people, its leaders, and all future generations,"" he added in a tweet.

For equipping and training of Somali National Army (SNA), the US has established an army base at Ballidogle where elite Danaab troops are trained.

Al-Shabaab apologizes to civilians

Although Somalia's spy agency NISA had claimed the attack was instigated by a foreign country, Al-Shabaab militants have claimed responsibility.

In a statement on Monday, the terror group apologized to the civilians who died and those wounded in the deadly attack.

""We are very sorry about the casualty that was inflicted on our Somali Muslim society, and we are extending our condolences to the Muslims who have lost their lives and or (were) wounded and or had their property destroyed.""

Noting that the attack did not realize the intended purpose, Al-Shabaab said their target was a convoy of Turkey nationals. Turkey supports FGS.

Al-Shabaab said, ""The Turks are our enemies and as we have said before, we will not stop fighting until they withdraw from our lands.""

The US airstrikes targeting Al-Shabaab

Barely 24 hours after the attack, the US with the assistance of SNA forces launched three airstrikes southern part of the country as part of the revenge mission.

US Africa Command (AFRICOM) said two militants were killed and two vehicles destroyed in Qunyo Barrow, while two more militants were killed in Caliyoow Barrow.

The US regularly carries out airstrikes in Somalia, though the frequency of such operations has risen sharply this year.

In an April statement, AFRICOM said it had killed more than 800 people in 110 strikes in Somalia since April 2017.

Al-Shabaab remains a big threat

Despite years of costly efforts to combat the group, al-Shabab managed once again to detonate a vehicle packed with explosives in Mogadishu, slaughtering 81 people on Saturday in one of the deadliest attacks of the decade.

""The real hallmark of al-Shabab is its resilience,"" said Matt Bryden, director of Nairobi-based think tank Sahan, as quoted by AFP.

Since then they have had to abandon most of their strongholds — but they still control vast rural areas and have maintained a presence in urban centers through an extensive intelligence network.

""They win support through co-option or coercion. They have a steady supply of finances through a network of taxation and extortion,"" Murithi Mutiga, a Horn of Africa analyst observes.

Mutiga said one of the biggest mistakes that had been made in the fight against al-Shabab was that they were often ousted from villages without ""a viable plan for what would come next.""

""Al-Shabab appears to be closing the decade in as strong a position as it has been in 10 years,"" said Mutiga.

Despite abandoning illegal charcoal trade, Al-Shabaab militants have resorted to ""mafia-style"" taxation tactics to sustain her activities according to the UN Panel of Experts report.

At least 22,000 soldiers drawn from various African countries have been spearheading peacekeeping mission in Somalia under AMISOM.

Special Judge Stephen Heimann sentenced 45-year-old Brian Cogdill after he pleaded guilty to beating to death his 19-year-old fiancee Emma Jean Jamison.

Cogdill agreed to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter in a negotiated plea deal. Judge Heimann accepted the plea deal and sentenced Cogdill to serve 14 years in prison, with ten years suspended and five years on probation. The agreement also requires Cogdill to register as a violent offender. He also waives his right to appeal the sentence.

During the hearing, Cogdill said he killed Jamison in the sudden heat of anger. He apologized to Jamison’s family for her death.

Jamison was incapacitated by a severe laceration to her head, a broken jaw and bruising all over her body, according to court documents. Forensic pathologist Thomas Sozio described her injuries as brutal.

Police believe Cogdill beat Jamison because he believed she was having an affair, using drugs and had stolen $300 he had saved for new dentures.

Police officers responded the evening of Sept. 6 to the home Cogdill and Jamison shared in the 6500 block of North County Road 760 East, south of the Indiana American Water Company. Cogdill told an officer that Jamison had overdosed.

He then changed his story, telling police that Jamison left their house for hours following an argument and returned home injured. He claimed someone selling her drugs had hurt her.

Dozens of Iran-allied militiamen and their supporters had camped out at the gates of the embassy overnight, a day after they broke into the compound, vandalising a reception area and smashing windows before pulling back.

It was one of the worst attacks on a US diplomatic mission in years.

There have been no reports of any injuries since the protests began.

The militiamen were protesting over deadly US air strikes which targeted an Iran-backed militia over the weekend, killing 25 fighters.

Those strikes were in response to a rocket attack on an Iraqi army base that killed a US contractor.

In Iraq, the protesters have been angered at their own government’s corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as its close ties to Tehran.

US President Donald Trump blamed Iran for the attack on the embassy and Defence Secretary Mark Esper later announced the immediate deployment of an infantry battalion of about 750 soldiers from the army’s 82nd Airborne Division to the Middle East.

He did not specify their destination, but a US official familiar with the decision said they will go to Kuwait.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted by state media on Tuesday as warning the US against any “miscalculation” in the worsening stand-off.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticised the US air strikes on the Iran-backed Iraqi militia on Sunday.

In remarks carried by the semi-official ISNA news agency, he accused the US of taking revenge on Iran for the defeat of the Islamic State group, which he said was an American creation.

In an apparent reference to Mr Trump’s allegations of Iranian involvement, Ayatollah Khamenei said “if the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly”.

Iran has close ties to Iraq’s Shiite majority and many of its major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.

Iran helped to mobilise tens of thousands of mostly Shiite militiamen to battle the Islamic State group when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in 2014 as the armed forces collapsed.

In the subsequent campaign against the extremists, the US and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory in December 2017.

The political influence of the Iran-backed militias, known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces, has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate the parliament and the government.

That has made them the target of mass protests since October that are unrelated to the attack on the embassy.

The anti-government protesters have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq. They have also set up a major protest camp in central Baghdad.

The militiamen and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with little if any resistance from authorities.

By Wednesday morning, they had set up a small sit-in of their own, with around 50 tents erected between two main gates about 500 yards apart.

Demonstrators set up a makeshift clinic and cooks with aprons reading “Popular Mobilisation Forces logistical support” served meals out of giant pots. Mobile toilets were also set up in the area.

Vehicles belonging to the Popular Mobilisation Forces, with government plates, were parked nearby, and the militiamen manned checkpoints where they searched all those arriving at the site of the demonstration.

China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing’s control by force if necessary.

Tsai (photo), who’s seeking re-election in a Jan 11 vote, also vowed in a New Year’s speech to defend Taiwan’s sovereignty, saying her government would build a mechanism to safeguard freedom and democracy as Beijing ramps up pressure on the island.

Fear of China has become a major element in the campaign, boosted by months of anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.

“Hong Kong people have shown us that ""one country, two systems"" is definitely not feasible,” Tsai said, referring to the political arrangement that guaranteed certain freedoms in the former British colony of Hong Kong after it was returned to China in 1997.

“Under ""one country, two systems"", the situation continues to deteriorate in Hong Kong. The credibility of ""one country, two systems"" has been sullied by the government’s abuse of power,” Tsai said.

Hong Kong has been hit by months of anti-government protests triggered by widespread resentment of perceived efforts by Beijing to exert control of the city despite the promises of autonomy.

Taiwan’s parliament passed an anti-infiltration law on Tuesday to combat perceived threats from China, further straining ties between Taiwan and Beijing.

Tsai said the law will protect Taiwan’s democracy and cross-strait exchanges will not be affected amid worries that the legislation may damage business ties with China.

China suspects Tsai and her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party of pushing for the island’s formal independence and has threatened it with war if there was any such move.

Tsai denies seeking independence and reiterated that she would not unilaterally change the status quo with China. - Reuters"," Threaten, not specified below",3

Gary Hinton was among those who fled the New South Wales town of Cobargo as fires raced through. He returned to a scene of devastation.

SYDNEY: A major operation to reach thousands of people stranded in fire-ravaged seaside towns was under way in Australia on Wednesday after deadly bushfires ripped through popular tourist spots and rural areas leaving at least eight people dead.

Navy ships and military aircraft were deployed alongside emergency crews to provide humanitarian relief and assess the damage from the deadliest spate of blazes yet in a months-long bushfire crisis.

Police said three more bodies were discovered Wednesday, bringing the confirmed death toll since late Monday to eight, including a volunteer firefighter killed when a ""fire tornado"" flipped his 10-tonne truck.

There were mounting fears for several others missing after the country's southeast was devastated by out-of-control blazes, which destroyed more than 200 homes and left some small towns in ruins.

Information was trickling out of coastal communities where thousands of holidaymakers and locals were thought to have seen in the New Year taking refuge from flames at surf clubs, as power outages and damage to telecommunications towers brought down phone lines and the internet.

New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said emergency services faced a ""real challenge"" trying to help injured people in isolated areas.

""We haven't been able to get access via roads or via aircraft. It's been... too dangerous and we simply can't access, nor can the people in these areas get out,"" he said.

Fires were raging across the country and the defence force said it could take days for the military to reach people in some remote areas.

- 'Ember attacks' -

There was relief in the town of Mallacoota -- where towering columns of smoke turned the sky pitch black and nearby fires caused waves of ""ember attacks"" -- after a change in the wind spared around 4,000 people who had huddled on the foreshore.

Survivors cheered firefighters who battled to protect them by creating a protective ring of fire trucks.

""I understand there was a standing ovation at the end of that for the firefighters,"" Victoria Emergency Management commissioner Andrew Crisp told public broadcaster ABC.

Authorities were preparing for the possibility that Mallacoota could be cut off for weeks: aircraft have begun dropping supplies into the town while a barge with two weeks' worth of supplies was due to arrive later Wednesday.

Paramedics were reportedly assessing the injured and moving those requiring further treatment to a 25-bed floating medical centre off the coast.

Many people have returned to find their homes burned to the ground, with the task of rebuilding shattered communities expected to take years.

Gary Hinton escaped flames roaring through Cobargo early Tuesday and returned to the stricken town to find his father's house largely intact, but many other buildings reduced to cinders.

""It wasn't good. It's turned out pretty devastating for everyone,"" he told AFP.

- 'Long and dangerous fight' -

Cooler temperatures and easing winds provided a window of opportunity for relief efforts Wednesday, but there were concerns over new fires sparked by lightning in alpine regions.

""There's a lot of people holidaying, again, up in those areas,"" Crisp said. ""We'll be prioritising those (fires) and hitting them as hard as we can. We don't need any new fires.""

Firefighters were racing to take advantage of the milder weather in the country's southeast to contain dozens of blazes, as authorities warned the fire danger would spike on Saturday as temperatures soar again.

""At the very least, weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.

""That makes this a long and dangerous and complex fight, a long and dangerous process to support everyone who's been impacted by it,"" Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews added.

This season's blazes have killed at least 17 people, destroyed more than 1,000 homes and scorched about 5.5 million hectares (13.5 million acres) -- an area bigger than Denmark or the Netherlands.

For weeks, major Australian cities have been choked by toxic bushfire smoke, and on Wednesday air quality reached hazardous levels in Canberra as visibility in the capital plummeted.

Satellite images showed smoke from the latest fires had blown across the Tasman Sea to reach New Zealand.

The unprecedented crisis has sparked street protests calling on the government to immediately act on climate change, which scientists say is creating a longer and more intense bushfire season.

Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison has come under increasing pressure for his response, which has included holidaying in Hawaii as the disaster unfolded and reiterating his steadfast support for Australia's lucrative -- but heavily polluting -- coal mining industry.

Officials in Sydney have also been criticised for ignoring calls to cancel the harbour city's famed New Year's Eve fireworks display.", Accuse of aggression,3

Trump earlier warned of retaliation against Iran, following violent protests led by Iranian-backed militia at the U.S. embassy in Iraq's Baghdad.

He also made reference to a similar attack on a U.S. consul in the Lebanese city of Benghazi in 2012.

(CNSNews.com) – U.S. troops reportedly fired teargas at pro-Iranian Iraqi militiamen outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on New Year’s Day, a day after militia members and supporters broke into the mission compound, prompting warnings from President Trump and a decision to deploy additional U.S. forces to the region.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei meanwhile hit back at Trump’s threats to retaliate.

Addressing a meeting of nurses in Tehran on Wednesday, Khamenei noted that Trump has blamed Iran for the recent incidents in Baghdad and has pledged to respond.

“First of all, like hell you will,” the Mehr news agency quoted Khamenei as saying.

“Second, be reasonable – which you are not. People of this region hate the United States,” the ayatollah continued. “Iraqis, Syrians, and Afghans all hate the U.S. and this hatred will eventually come out in some way.”

On Tuesday, Trump tweeted in response to the incidents at the embassy, “Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!”

Earlier, dozens of members of Iran-backed Shi’ite militias had stormed the compound, damaging a reception area and setting an unmanned guard post on fire. They claimed to be protesting U.S. F-15 strikes at the weekend on five bases – in western Iraq and eastern Syria – of the Kata’ib Hezbollah militia, an Iranian proxy in Iraq.

Those strikes, which killed at least 25 militiamen, were in retaliation for a rocket attack two days earlier on a military base near Kirkuk in northern Iraq used by U.S. forces. An American civilian contractor was killed in the rocket barrage.

On Wednesday, anti-U.S. elements gathered again near the embassy – in “large numbers,” according to the National Iraqi News Agency.

The Associated Press then reported that U.S. troops had fired tear gas to disperse the individuals gathered outside the compound.

“The U.S. Marines guarding the embassy fired tear gas as more crowds arrived and after the protesters lit a fire on the roof of the reception area on Wednesday,” AP reports. “Smoke rose from the building. Protesters also firebombed a second gate, setting another fire. U.S. soldiers were seen on the roof of the main embassy building.”

Kata’ib Hezbollah, a Shi’ite militia supported by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qods Force – and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization since 2009 – is part of the so-called “Popular Mobilization Forces,” an umbrella force formed in Iraq in 2014 to help government troops fight Sunni ISIS terrorists.

In his speech on Wednesday, Khamenei charged that the U.S. had attacked the bases to take revenge against Kata’ib Hezbollah for its part in defeating ISIS. (Even though the U.S. brought together and led a military coalition to destroy ISIS, Khamenei has long claimed – and did so again on Wednesday – that ISIS was in fact a “creation” of the United States.)

Khamenei also warned that while Iran was not looking for war, if anyone threatens it, “we will unhesitatingly confront and strike them.”

In response to Tuesday’s incident at the embassy, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced the deployment to the Middle East of some 750 soldiers from the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division.

Speaking to CBS Evening News on Tuesday night, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the attack on the embassy compound “state-sponsored terror.”

“This is Iranian-backed terrorism that took place that threatened American interests,” he said.

“What you saw was Iranian-backed terrorists – many of them are individuals that have been designated terrorists by the United States and others – come into the American Embassy and posing a risk to American diplomats and personnel inside the embassy,” Pompeo told Fox News on Tuesday night.

“You saw President Trump direct a quick, decisive, prudent response by making sure that we had all the resources necessary to keep our people safe and to secure the compound as well,” he added. A U.S. Marine taskforce was sent from Kuwait to Baghdad on Tuesday to bolster security, and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters overflew the area, launching warning flares.

When the militiamen and supporters first approached the embassy on Tuesday Iraqi security forces allowed them to do so, although Iraqi personnel were later deployed in the area.

Pompeo said he and Trump had spoken separately during the day to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, urging the Iraqis to fulfil “their obligation to protect our facility and our people.”

“We were happy to see them deploy forces there to do that. We continue to ask them to do everything it takes to ensure that that facility is protected, as they have an obligation to do.”

Iraq’s Shi’ite-dominated government, in turmoil after weeks of popular protests, has good relations with the Shi’ite regime in Tehran. At the same time it has invited U.S. forces – currently some 5,000-strong – to be stationed in the country, to train the Iraqi forces and ensure that the ISIS threat does not re-emerge.

8395,6264ecc98267cf0772002cf9a58e0a55,"It would be easy to believe, if you pay attention to the media, that Australian children are in poor shape.

Kids, we are told, have too much screen time, too little exercise, too many scheduled activities and not enough risk and freedom. Earnest commentators constantly critique “helicopter parenting”, “tiger mothers”, “intensive mothering” and “bubble-wrapped children”.

There is certainly some basis to these fears. But it’s also instructive to take an historical perspective, because while childhood has changed in important respects since the second world war, there are surprising continuities.

Every generation of elders has worried about “young people of today”, from the 1950s to the 2010s. Some of the changes to childhood and parenthood could even be characterised as positive. So how has the idea of childhood, and the relationship between children and parents, changed since the 1950s?

The boomers’ parents worried about them too

From its earliest days, a baby of the 1950s usually had a single maternal figure as primary caregiver. Women were expected to become mothers and homemakers, whereas men were expected to be breadwinners and less involved in childcare.

Some valued this gendered division of labour, while some mothers felt restricted by cultural expectations, and some fathers possibly regretted their limited role in their children’s upbringing.

Women’s liberation in the 1970s overturned the idea that mothers would devote themselves solely to child-rearing. National Library of Australia

The women’s liberation movement overturned such assumptions, stimulating increased maternal workforce participation. By the 21st century, expectations reversed, from a presumption that mothers didn’t work to an expectation that they did. In addition to their paid workload, contemporary women’s caring and domestic work increases dramatically after having children. The domestic division of labour is still far from equal.

Many fathers today want to be more involved in their children’s lives but feel constrained by cultural expectations and financial pressures. Australian families have also diversified, embracing new structures including single parents by choice, same-sex parents, blended families and more.

Child-rearing philosophies have certainly changed. Parents of the 1950s relied on informal advice from relatives and friends, whereas today parents can feel overwhelmed by the volume and contradictions of child-raising advice, delivered by health professionals and “experts” of more dubious qualifications.

In parallel to the women’s liberation movement, children’s rights began to be taken more seriously in Australia from the 1970s and were given international legal status under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child in 1989. Such shifts led to a greater interest in children’s perspectives and emotions. For example, corporal punishment is now widely frowned on and has been banned in schools.

Whereas post-war child-rearing emphasised discipline and routine, parent-child relationships in 2020 are more emotionally expressive, relational and intense.

With the popularisation of psychology, childhood became viewed as the critical phase for emotional growth. Parents, particularly mothers, continue to bear a weighty responsibility for healthy child development.

Despite changes in child-rearing approaches, every generation of Australian parents has tried to do their best for their children. Parental love is constant.

We also expect more emotionally from children. Many post-war children rarely left their mother’s care until kindergarten, whereas today many Australian preschoolers experience some non-maternal care. In 2011, three-quarters of Australian mothers returned to paid work by the time their child was 13 months old, on average resuming when their child was 6.5 months old.

From being a rarity in the 1950s, childcare centres have multiplied. Shifts in caregivers represent rising emotional expectations of preschool children: that they should be able to tolerate separation from their primary caregiver and behave appropriately in a social and learning setting.

As children have gradually spent more time in childcare, preschool, primary school and secondary school, adults outside the family have a greater influence in a child’s life.

Childhood freedom shrinks?

Remembering their postwar childhoods, baby boomers emphasise their freedom to roam as long as they were “home by dark”. Children’s independent roaming has shrunk in urbanised societies across the world since the mid-20th century. But there is plenty of evidence that post-war adults still feared for children’s safety, worrying about poisonous chemicals around the home, and teachers were concerned about “stranger danger”, traffic accidents and dangerous toys.

Baby boomers also recall “making their own fun” without elaborate toys or adult-organised activities. They remember playing scratch footy with a paper ball, swimming in ponds and creeks, and exploring wilder areas. But, simultaneously, store-bought toys became more affordable to less-privileged families in the 1950s, as new materials and mass production reduced prices. And while kids today doubtless have more “stuff”, they still enjoy constructing sandcastles, climbing trees and creating cubbies with sticks and leaves.

The dangers of screen time for young children and the risks of online bullying or abuse generate enormous anxiety in parents today. Yet every generation of parent has worried about children’s “downtime”. In the late 19th century, reading novels was feared to encourage precocious sexuality in young women. In the 1980s, parents warned their children that watching television would lead to “square eyes”.

Children of the 1980s will remember being warned too much television would give them ‘square eyes’. Shutterstock

Concern about tablet or smartphone use among preschoolers follows a long tradition of parental anxiety about the impact of new technologies. While social media can certainly host antisocial behaviour, digital communications can also connect young people across geographic distance and overcome social barriers like mobility issues or vision impairment.

While more instances of anxiety and depression are being identified in children and teenagers, this does not mean mental illness is actually increasing.

These days, parents are more likely to initiate dialogues about painful emotions and challenging relationships. Conversations between parents and children have become franker around many topics, including sexuality, puberty, body safety and dealing with difficult feelings. The emotional lexicon of the parent-child relationship has become more open and complex.

Not all Australians experience happy childhoods or loving families. A series of government inquiries have exposed shocking mistreatment of children, including those forcibly removed from their families, such as the Stolen Generations, and children abused while in the “care” of welfare institutions and religious organisations.

While the revelations of such abuse have been distressing, they indicate an important cultural shift in Australia. No longer will we allow abused children to repress their stories in secrecy and shame. Let’s hope these painful testimonies of past childhoods will help prevent the traumatising of future childhoods.

Australian childhood is in good shape

Concern about childhoods in the present is often a disguise for nostalgia about childhoods past. We nurture highly emotive associations with our memories of growing up, by virtue of the privileged place that childhood is seen to hold in the formation of adult identity.

While the details of childhood and parent-child relationships shift in different historical contexts, the fundamentals remain the same. Childhood is a time of learning, exploring, growing – and the appropriate way to grow is dependent on the cultural circumstances into which each generation is born.

Parents will always strive to do their best for their children. Constant collective concern and criticism only increase parental anxiety and hyper-vigilance, exacerbating the “lawnmower parenting” and “hothouse children” that stimulated the concern in the first place."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The semi-autonomous city has been embroiled in protests for more than six months. What were originally demonstrations against an extradition law have evolved to become about police brutality and democracy.

Today’s march had been a peaceful one, with protesters demanding more concessions from the government, which is led by Carrie Lam. Yet they soon deteriorated into tense scenes, with police responding by firing tear gas to disperse protestors in the Wanchai district.



The protesters quickly formed into a line of defence. Some threw petrol bombs at the police, according to Reuters.



The long-running protests have shaken the prosperous city. It officially entered a recession for the first time in a decade at the end of October, after its economy contracted for a second successive quarter.



The financial hub’s economy shrank by 3.2 per cent in the three months to the end of September, much more than the 0.6 per cent contraction that had been estimated.



Lam, Hong Kong’s beleaguered chief executive, said at the time that she expected the city to record negative economic growth in 2019.



Last week Lam said that Christmas celebrations had been “ruined” by “reckless and selfish rioters”.

She said of the protests: “Such illegal acts have not only dampened the festive mood but also adversely affected local businesses.”



The protests began six months ago over a controversial new bill that critics saw as a tightening of Beijing’s control over the territory. The bill has since been withdrawn, but the demonstrations have shown little sign of stopping.

In a case that Britain’s foreign ministry said raised serious concerns, a district court ruled on Tuesday that the woman, aged 19 at the time, had lied about being sexually abused by 12 Israeli teenagers.

Sentencing has been set for Jan 7.

The woman, who has not been identified by media, was arrested after police said she had withdrawn an accusation that the teenagers had raped her in a hotel room at the holiday resort of Ayia Napa in July.

The woman maintained that she had recanted her accusation only under duress from police, during persistent questioning without a lawyer present. Prosecutors and the court dismissed that justification.

The case has attracted widespread media coverage in Britain, which accounted for a third of the 3.9 million tourists who visited Cyprus in 2018.

The woman faces a jail sentence of up to one year. Her lawyers have said she intends to appeal the verdict.

Speaking to BBC radio, the woman’s mother said she supported calls on social media for British holidaymakers to avoid the island.

“My personal view is that’s a good thing to do,” she said.

“The place isn’t safe – it is absolutely not safe. And if you go and report something that’s happened to you, you’re either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what’s happened to my daughter may happen.”

The violence broke out during a largely peaceful march as masses of regular citizens pressed authorities for further concessions in the Chinese-ruled city.

In the Wanchai bar district, some protesters had spray-painted graffiti and smashed cash machines in an HSBC bank branch when plainclothes police moved in, pepper-spraying crowds in a tense face-off, after which several rounds of tear gas were fired.

The protesters, many masked and clad in black, re-grouped and formed their own line, hurling several petrol bombs and unfurling umbrellas.

Protesters have directed their ire at the global banking group HSBC saying that it had closed an account that had been a fund-raising platform for the protest movement, a claim the bank has strongly denied.

Earlier in the day, under grey clouds, citizens young and old, carried signs such as “Freedom is not free” before setting off.

Thousands of Hong Kong revellers had earlier welcomed in 2020 on neon-lit promenades along the skyline of Victoria Harbour, chanting the movement's signature slogan - “Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our Time” - for the final seconds before clocks struck midnight.

A sea of protesters then surged down Nathan Road, a major boulevard, blocking all lanes in a spontaneous march breaking out within minutes of the new decade. Some held signs reading ”Lets keep fighting together in 2020.”

“It's hard to utter 'Happy New Year' because Hong Kong people are not happy,” said a man named Tung, who was walking with his two-year-old son, mother and niece.

“Unless the five demands are achieved, and police are held accountable for their brutality, we can't have a real happy new year,” he added.

He was referring to the push for concessions from the government including full democracy, an amnesty for the more than 6,500 people arrested so far, and a powerful, independent investigation into police actions.

The pro-democracy march is being organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, a group that arranged a number of marches last year that drew millions.

Along the route, a number of newly elected pro-democracy district politicians mingled with the crowds on their first day in office.

“The government has already started the oppression before the New Year began ... whoever is being oppressed, we will stand with them,” said Jimmy Sham, one of the leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front.

Overnight, police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons during some brief standoffs.

China's President Xi Jinping said in a New Year's speech that Beijing will “resolutely safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong under the so-called ‘one country, two systems framework”.

Many people in Hong Kong are angered by Beijing's tight grip on the city which was promised a high degree of autonomy under this framework when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

Beijing denies interference and blames the West for fomenting the unrest.

A group of 40 parliamentarians and dignitaries from 18 countries had written an open letter to Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam on New Year's Eve, urging her to “seek genuine ways forward out of this crisis by addressing the grievances of Hong Kong people.”

The protest movement is supported by 59% of the city's residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute.

8515,e5c24bf926974de20ee24fa96ca4c77d,"In a desert far from any city, farmers use groundwater to grow lush green hay. The hay fattens livestock all over the world. But there's a big problem: The water is drying up. Now scientists warn it will take thousands of years for an aquifer in southeastern Oregon to recover, while residents there are already hurting.

At Marjorie and John Thelen's house, the well ran dry in 2015.

""We're not ranchers. We're not growing hay. We're just retired in the country,"" said 72-year-old Marjorie Thelen, who moved to Oregon with her husband, John, 12 years ago.

Impressed by the mountain views and the rambling sagebrush, they bought a modest house to spend the rest of their days in Harney County, Ore. Then, hay farming boomed around them.

""It was like a gold rush,"" said 78-year-old John Thelen, describing how more giant steel sprinklers arrived after a state agency warned of water scarcity in 2016. He dreads the growing season: ""It's like having your arteries cut open and watching the blood run out, when your water is being sprayed to the wind and it's evaporating away at humongous quantities.""

Like most people in this high, dry valley, the couple gets drinking water out of the ground. When their first well failed, they paid thousands of dollars to drill deeper, only to find high levels of arsenic in the groundwater there. Now, their kitchen is cluttered with plastic bottles. A cup of tea starts with a towering filtration system.

Support comes from

The Thelens say enough is enough: that it's time for large-scale agriculture in the desert to end.

Meanwhile, Harney County commissioner and hay farmer Mark Owens says gradual and voluntary conservation is critical for the region's overall economic health. He argues that farms aren't the final destination for the water.

""I use a lot of water, but the crops that I raise go to Tillamook to produce the milk in the ice cream that you eat or the grains to feed the beef that you eat,"" Owens said.

He points out that without farming, the local tax base would collapse, taking schools, roads, libraries and law enforcement with it.

""This issue that's happening in [the] Harney Basin is going to happen in a community next to you,"" he said. ""If it's not, just wait. We have to protect agriculture.""

Aquifer out of balance

Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey just spent three years studying the Harney Basin, mapping an aquifer starkly out of balance. They found powerful wells draining isolated pockets of water much faster than those spaces refill. But historically, lawmakers divvied up groundwater as if it were coming from some giant subterranean ocean that would never run out.

""I'll give you an example,"" explained Todd Jarvis, director of the Institute for Water and Watersheds at Oregon State University. ""In 1904, a Texas Supreme Court ruling found that groundwater was so secret, occult and concealed that it was too difficult to legally control it.""

More than a hundred years later, this mindset is slowly changing. Texas now has groundwater conservation districts. California recently became the first state to pass a law requiring sustainable groundwater management. And at an Oregon dinner table, people in conflict are working toward the state's first-ever voluntary conservation agreement.

The alternative is to shut off water on the basis of seniority, a centuries-old system that farmers warn would plunge the region into a depression.

Common ground

For Brenda Smith of the High Desert Partnership, finding common ground is all about building relationships.

""It's a thousand cups of coffee,"" said the director of the nonprofit that mediates natural resource conflicts in eastern Oregon. Building consensus is slow work, she admits, ""but if you're going to fight about it, we don't have that time either.""

For the last three years, people in Harney County have been coming together regularly for meals and meetings. They form a circle, where hay farmers like Owens, who want to change slowly, sit across from homeowners like the Thelens, who want decisive action now, before the wells run dry again.

New Delhi: A day after the Uttar Pradesh Police wrote to the Ministry of Home Affairs seeking a ban on the Popular Front of India (PFI) in relation to the anti-citizenship law protests in the state, Times Now has accessed the police report which lists out the evidence against the organisation.

The Uttar Pradesh Police report on PFI, submitted with the Home Ministry, clearly spells out five charges on which a ban has been sought against the organisation accused of instigating violence in Uttar Pradesh over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The police report states, as per sources, that the PFI masterminded the violence witnessed in state capital Lucknow. Further, the PFI top brass is believed to be involved in instigating CAA-related violence.

According to the police, the Uttar Pradesh head of the PFI and treasurer have confessed to their role in the violence witnessed in the state.

Further, the police have informed the MHA that the PFI incited people for violence using social media. The UP police also found during the investigation that the state PFI leadership facilitated anti-CAA gatherings which resulted in arson.

It may be noted here that the UP Police has arrested three PFI members - Wasim, Nadeem and Ashfaq – in connection with the anti-CAA violence. Wasim is the UP chief of PFI while Ashfaq is the treasurer. Nadeem is an activist of the organisation.

During the investigation, the police confiscated placards, flags, literature, cuttings and posters for the anti-CAA protest from the three arrested PFI members.

Nadeem and Ashfaq have confessed before the police that they devised a strategy for the protest and publicised it using social media. The duo also used messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram to share inciting material including literature and video.

In UP’s Shamli, 14 PFI activists were arrested for inciting gatherings during anti-CAA protests. Four PFI activists have also been arrested in Meerut, which also witnessed violence.

""25 persons affiliated with the Popular Front of India have been arrested across the state, for their involvement in different criminal activities,"" Praveen Kumar, IG (Law and Order), Uttar Pradesh said.

Around 20 people have died in anti-CAA protests so far, a majority of them in Uttar Pradesh alone.

Uttar Pradesh DGP OP Singh had yesterday confirmed writing to the MHA seeking a ban on the PFI. ""We have written to the Union Home Ministry, recommending that the PFI should be banned,"" the DGP told reporters.

UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said the PFI was nothing but the ""incarnation"" of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). PFI's hand in the violence in the state has been ""established"", Maurya said, adding: ""The truth is emerging through the probe. If SIMI reappears in any form, it will be crushed.""

Meanwhile, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today said the MHA will take a call on banning PFI basis evidence on the table. “PFI's role in violence is coming forward. The Home Ministry will decide on further action based on evidence. There are many allegations against them including having a connection with the Students Islamic Movement of India.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

A man crossed the road to his neighbour's house late at night and slashed a tyre on his van after being earlier refused a lift, a court has heard.

Ciaran Gillespie (32) carried out the ""sinister"" attack on the vehicle after he ""took umbrage"" at the way he was spoken to by his neighbour.

Gillespie had a serious drink problem and had relapsed weeks before the incident.

Judge John Hughes adjourned the case, ordering a probation report on the accused and compensation to be paid.

Carpenter Gillespie, of Elton Drive, Ard Na Greine, Dublin 13, pleaded guilty to criminal damage.

Gda Owen Herlihy told Dublin District Court he attended Slademore Avenue, Ard Na Greine, last May 16.

A passenger-side tyre had been slashed on the victim's van and CCTV footage showed the accused coming across the road from his own house at 4.10am.

The damage was to the value of €189.

Gillespie's only previous convictions were for motoring offences.

He made admissions to gardai and said he had no recollection of the incident.

Addiction

Defence solicitor Miska Hanahoe said that when he was arrested the next day, Gillespie was still not sober.

Gda Herlihy said ""there was a level of intoxication"".

Gillespie had no history of aggression or violence, but had a very serious, long-term alcohol addiction, Ms Hanahoe said.

At the time of the incident, he was living across the road from the victim, and ""took umbrage at the way he was spoken to when he asked him for a lift"".

He had been in rehab but relapsed ""in a major way"" three weeks earlier, Ms Hanahoe said.

The accused apologised, was ashamed, embarrassed and remorseful about what happened.

He had now moved back to his native Donegal and was dealing with his addiction.

Judge Hughes told Gillespie his neighbour had ""owed you nothing, he didn't owe you a lift, he may have had good reason for not wanting to give you a lift"".

He said he was not going to speculate as to the logic of what had happened, adding: ""He knows he is a person who can't drink a drop… he knows he can't drink in moderation.""

He said he had sympathy for the accused's addiction, but warned that ""it's very difficult to get alcohol in prison""."," Threaten, not specified below",3

In the past year, South Africa has made major changes to how it manages HIV.

Everyone can now start receiving treatment as soon as they know their status.

But doctors say while medications are working, social issues mean infection rates remain high.

As more people receive treatment, the number of infected people has also grown, because people are living longer.

South Africa's treatment programme has been a success, but prevention efforts not so much.

Almost half of HIV infections worldwide undetected: WHO

The World Health Organization warned that nearly half of all people with HIV around the globe do not know they are infected, and called for broader access to at-home testing kits.

The UN health agency said that 40 percent of people with the virus that causes Aids, or more than 14 million people worldwide, are unaware of their status, according to last year's estimates.

However, that marks a huge improvement from a decade earlier when only 12 percent of people with HIV were estimated to know they had the virus.

But the continued lack of diagnoses remains a major obstacle to implementing WHO's recommendation for everyone with HIV to be offered anti-retroviral therapy (ART).

Pope urges 'responsible behaviour'

Meanwhile, Pope Francis issued a call for ""responsible behaviour"" to prevent the spread of Aids without specifying whether that included wearing condoms.

The pontiff also issued a fresh call for every sufferer, no matter how poor, to have access to treatment.

He added: ""I ask you to pray for them and their loved ones and promote solidarity so that even the poorest can benefit from diagnosis and adequate treatment.

""And finally I call on everyone to adopt responsible behaviour to prevent the further spread of this disease.""

Young gay men at the frontline of Aids prevention in China

More than 2,300 students between 15 and 24 tested positive for HIV/Aids in the first nine months of this year, according to data from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention that was cited by the official Xinhua News Agency late on Wednesday.

By the end of September, more than 654,000 people were living with HIV/Aids in China, Xinhua said.

As the problem worsens, Beijing has turned its HIV/Aids prevention efforts towards high-school and university students.

China's first-ever health centre focusing on preventing the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, among those aged 15-24 was opened in Beijing on Saturday, according to the official China News Service.

The speed reduction on Sheikh Zayed Road, displayed on digital signs, came as the UAE woke to thick patches of fog covering areas inland and along the coast for the fourth consecutive day this week.

The National Centre of Meteorology issued an alert warning of fog affecting a large swathe of the country, stretching from the coast around Abu Dhabi down to Al Ain, close to the border with Oman.

Visibility was down to 100m in areas, including sections of Sheikh Zayed Road.

Abu Dhabi Police urged drivers to be cautious and avoid filming the fog on their phones.

This week, motorists in Abu Dhabi received an emergency alert by text message warning them of an 80kph restriction on Monday. The variable speed limits in bad weather were first introduced last year and have been implemented several times since, including during sandstorms.

Wednesday's fog is expected to burn off by around 10.30am, leaving a partly cloudy day with temperatures of up to 27°C on the coast and 28°C inland. There will also be light to moderate southwesterly to northwesterly winds.

TWO SOLDIERS, Naik Sawant Sandip Raghunath (29) and Rifleman Arjun Thapa Magar (25), were killed in an encounter with some “infiltrators” during a cordon-and-search operation in Nowshera on Tuesday night.

A Defence Ministry spokesperson, Lt Colonel Devender Anand, said the infiltrators were intercepted in Khari Thrayat forest when they were trying to sneak into India from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

“In the intervening night of December 31 and January 1, a contact was established with infiltrators in a forest in Nowshera sector. The heavily armed terrorists retaliated by fire.

Iran-backed Iraqi militia members and supporters on Wednesday withdrew from the mission by order of their leaders, ending a 24-hour siege after the arrival overnight of more American troops.

""The attack on our embassy yesterday was orchestrated by Iran,” Mr Hook told The National.

He said the Trump administration saw a direct operational link between the attack on Tuesday and the government in Tehran.

“Iran organises, trains and equips Shiite military proxies and we do not make a distinction between the Iranian regime and Iranian militias,"" Mr Hook said.

“Any attack by an Iranian militia, the Iranian regime will be held accountable.""

Mr Hook said the decision by Iraqi militias to withdraw their supporters from the embassy’s perimeter as “a positive development”.

He said the situation was “relatively calm”, and that the US troops sent to Baghdad and Iraqi military posted at the embassy would improve security.

Mr Hook said he expected more sanctions to be imposed on Iran, whose government was “isolated, running out of money and in a state of panicked aggression”.

The attack on the embassy and the withdrawal order from the Popular Mobilisation Forces, the umbrella body of Iraqi militias mainly answering to Iran, highlighted Tehran’s reach in Iraq.

It threatened to raise tension with the US to a level where violence could be difficult to control.

“We call on all of the crowds present near the US embassy to withdraw in deference to the order by the Iraqi government and to preserve the prestige of the state,” the PMF said, according to Russia Today TV.

The Iraqi military later said: ""All protesters have withdrawn, tents dismantled and other forms of demonstrating that accompanied these protests have ended, and the Iraqi security forces have completely secured the embassy perimeter.""

Militia members and supporters remained camped outside the embassy despite tear gas and stun grenades fired at them earlier on Wednesday by Iraqi or US forces.

US President Donald Trump said earlier that Iran would be held “fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities”.

....Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019

Despite the ease with which the crowd entered Baghdad's high-security Green Zone to attack the embassy on Tuesday, their action appeared to be planned to avoid a full assault on the compound or loss of life.

That was in line with a strategy by Washington and Tehran to keep a check on any escalation between the two.

An Iraqi special forces fighter assigned to guard the Green Zone told AFP his units had no orders to intervene.

""If I had had orders to act, I could have fired and stopped the storming of the embassy,"" he said.

Some buildings outside the embassy compound were set on fire and members of the crowd, some in military fatigues, again hurled stones at the embassy on Wednesday.

The attack recalled the 1979 hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran and the 2012 attack on the US mission in the Libyan city of Benghazi.

US military released video of troops being flown in to the embassy after Defence Secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday that about 750 more soldiers would be sent immediately to Baghdad.

The embassy was attacked in retaliation to US air strikes on Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia sites in Iraq and Syria on Sunday, in which at least 25 of its members were killed and dozens more wounded.

The Pentagon said the raids were in response to a rocket attack on an American base in Kirkuk last week, in which an American contractor was killed.

It was the latest in a series of attacks on US targets in Iraq since Washington intensified sanctions on Iran in mid-2019.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday said on Twitter that he strongly condemned “the US's malice"" in the raids on the militia.

That guy has tweeted that we see Iran responsible for the events in Baghdad & we will respond to Iran. 1st: You can’t do anything. 2nd: If you were logical —which you’re not— you’d see that your crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan… have made nations hate you. https://t.co/hMGOEDwHuY — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) January 1, 2020

Kataib Hezbollah is one of the militias most loyal to Iran in the PMF.

Although the paramilitary forces are nominally integrated into the Iraqi state, some often operate under orders from Iran, the US and Iraqis say.

""Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible,"" Mr Trump said on Twitter.

A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah said its supporters intended to lay siege to the embassy until it was shut down and US diplomats left Iraq.

""What's in a name?"" Shakespeare famously wondered in Romeo and Juliet. In the fast-paced world of San Francisco real estate, it turns out that it means quite a bit, according to local agents.

Across the city, areas that were known for years by one designation have changed names over the last decade to indicate that they have their own flair and personality, as well as desirability.

""Neighborhoods will start to differentiate themselves and seem ripe for renaming when there is a commercial strip that starts to thrive and drive shoppers and bar and restaurant patrons to it,"" said Compass agent Nina Hatvany. ""At that point people get interested in living close by and start to want a name to describe the neighborhood they are interested in, as opposed to surrounding neighborhoods.""

She pointed to NOPA as a recent example. The area just west of the Divisadero corridor and, yes, just north of the Panhandle, used to be part of Western Addition. But when the popular restaurant Nopa opened in 2006 it marked the beginning of a higher profile for the area that separated it from the rest of Western Addition, which used to stretch west from Van Ness to Masonic, or even Arguello back in the day.

In the intervening decades, Hayes Valley, Cathedral Hill, Alamo Square, Anza Vista, Lone Mountain and Lower Haight all broke away from the larger designations as separate neighborhoods in their own right. Now NOPA has followed suit. ""North of the Panhandle meant nothing 10 years ago and now of course it’s a very hip neighborhood,"" Hatvany said.

Other examples of more recent neighborhood renamings are Yerba Buena, which used to be part of SOMA, and Polk Gulch (""So vibrant and desirable,"" said Hatvany), which used to be part of Russian Hill.

Many of these redubbings are, of course, led by real estate agents. ""As realtors we will start referring to the neighborhood by its new name when touring with clients to show that we are tuned in to neighborhood changes,"" said Climb agent Hector Orozco. It can take at least a year for that new name to be accepted by the city at large, he added.

ALSO: Fascinating stories behind San Francisco neighborhood names

As a San Francisco native, Orozco was particularly surprised by the ""Inner Mission"" designation that sprung up relatively recently to describe the area centered around the Valencia and Mission corridors approximately between 14th and 24th streets. ""Growing up it was always known as the Mission,"" he said. ""Although that area does have a separate feel now than the rest of the Mission.""

Orozco and Hatvany agreed that a renaming only sticks if there's a genuine change going on in the area. For that reason, they both questioned whether the East Cut (formerly considered part of Rincon Hill or South Beach) would make the grade, despite its Google Maps designation. ""East Cut was a bit surprising since it was so clearly a marketing ploy to ‘rebrand’ the neighborhood, rather than an evolution over time of a distinct community,"" said Hatvany.

She feels there are many other neighborhoods that are developing that distinctive feeling and may earn a renaming in the years ahead. In the Inner Richmond we may soon see ""Clement Gulch"" break away at the tail-end of Geary. ""Sutro Heights"" is ""quite different from its Outer Richmond surroundings,"" Hatvany said. She can also imagine the Outer Sunset area closest to the beach getting its own designation.

""It seems to me that the Outer Sunset is a huge neighborhood and should really be split into what is adjacent to the beach, with its surfer culture and alternative vibe, and what is not,"" she said. ""Perhaps Central Sunset and Ocean Beach?""

U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces re-election in 2020, on Tuesday threatened to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want to go to war.

The protests also cast uncertainty over the continued presence of U.S. troops in Iraq.

Overnight, demonstrators pitched tents and camped outside the embassy walls. On Wednesday morning, they were bringing in food supplies, cooking equipment and mattresses, Reuters witnesses said, suggesting they intended to stay for a long time.

Senior Iraqi army officers had negotiated with those gathered outside the embassy in an attempt to convince them to leave but failed to do so. Washington is putting pressure on Iraqi leaders to ensure the security of its staff.

The incident marked a sharp escalation of the proxy conflict between Washington and Tehran - both influential players in Iraq - while mass protests are challenging Iraq's own political system nearly 17 years after the U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.

The protests followed U.S. air strikes on Sunday on bases operated by the Iranian-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah inside Iraq which killed at least 25 fighters and wounded 55.

The strikes were retaliation for the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, which Washington blamed on Kataib Hezbollah.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday y condemned the U.S. attacks.

""The Iranian government, nation and I strongly condemn the attacks,"" Iranina state TV quoted Khamenei as saying.

Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the violence at the U.S. Embassy and said Tehran would be held responsible. Iran rejected the accusation.

More U.S. troops were being sent to the embassy, U.S. officials said. The 750 troops would initially be based out of Kuwait. The officials said that as many as 4,000 troops could be sent to the region in the coming days if needed. Q

State law regulates four flags that can be flown at public buildings in Florida: The U.S. flag, the Florida flag, the POW-MIA flag and the Firefighter Memorial Flag.

As of January 1, the Honor and Remember flag joins those ranks. It’s been adopted in 24 states to honor members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have given their lives in the line of duty.

The bill authorizes the flag to be displayed on the following days:

Veterans Day, November 11;

Gold Star Mother’s Day, the last Sunday in September; and

A day on which a member of the U.S. Armed Forces who is a resident of the state loses his or her life in the line of duty.

SB 702: Qualified Blind Trusts

The Legislature will no longer allow blind trusts for conflicts of interest.

Florida’s blind trust law was not as strict as one for federal politicians, and critics say it allowed former Gov. Rick Scott to shield his financial investments from public disclosure.

According to the Miami Herald, only two politicians in Florida have used a blind trust: Scott, and Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried.

CS/CS/CS/HB 1033: Continuing Care Contracts

A few years back, University Village in Tampa went through bankruptcy, and news reports documented issues like trash piling up and lack of heat for residents.

Now, Florida now has stricter oversight of similar senior living centers, known as Continuing Care Retirement Centers. CCRCs have big entrance fees, costing as much as a home to get into. But they offer increasing levels of care as you age, whether you just need help into the shower or you need a nursing home bed.

Mary Ellen K. Early, the public policy liaison for LeadingAge Florida, an organization that represents CCRC, said the law creates an early-warning system for state regulators.

“It was a unique situation that probably would never happen again, but lawmakers and the Florida Life Care Residents Association felt it was important to update the law that governs these communities to reduce the likelihood of a similar situation occurring in the future,” Early wrote in an email. “The changes that take effect on January 1, 2020 create an early warning system for the Office of Insurance Regulation to identify and work with financially challenged CCRCs early enough to prevent major problems.”

CS/HB 831: Electronic Prescribing

Starting January 1, doctors will have to submit all of their prescriptions electronically if they have an electronic health record. Florida joins 15 other states that require e-prescribing, and Medicare will require it for controlled substances next year. There are some exceptions built into the law, like when a patient is on hospice.

CS/CS/HB 1009: Business Organizations

This law modernizes oversight of Florida’s 778,000 corporations, including allowing them to hold remote shareholder meetings and have the same name as another company – with that company’s approval.

The American Bar Association wrote the Model Business Corporations Act, which is a body of laws designed to regulate companies the same across state lines. That group of laws was updated in 2016, and Florida updated its laws to match, with a few exceptions.

CS/CS/CS/HB 431: Liens Against Motor Vehicles and Vessels

This law will make it harder for auto repair shops to put liens on vehicles because of unpaid repair bills. Lawmakers say the bill will cut down on fraud in the industry.

CS/CS/HB 409: Electronic Legal Documents

Florida will now allow notaries to verify documents online.

The biggest effect from this is that electronic wills are legal in Florida now. Some documents – like a durable power of attorney – can’t be done electronically. And vulnerable residents, like people in nursing homes, must still have estate planning documents verified by a notary in person.

9122,6adc4f256542f547e53b40b81210a91b,"Last month, employees of the State Comptroller’s Office received a letter from their director-general warning them against speaking to the media about the conduct of the comptroller.

The message came on the heels of a series of leaks from employees expressing grave concern about actions taken by State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman since his June appointment, which they asserted were rendering his office toothless.

Englman has dismissed the reports against him as baseless and claimed that those who spoke to the media were seeking to discredit him before he’d published even a single audit.

Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up

However, a former State Comptroller’s Office official still in contact with his old colleagues told The Times of Israel that the reality regarding Englman’s conduct is “even worse than what’s being reported,” and that the new ombudsman is bent on making audits “completely irrelevant.”

Politically motivated whitewashing

One of the more egregious reports regarding Englman came from The Marker business daily, which revealed last month that officials at the comptroller’s office were refusing to put their names on a long-anticipated audit of the Finance Ministry because, they claimed, Englman had whitewashed its conclusions.

The comptroller report probed, among other things, whether the ministry had used inappropriate methods to arrive at the number it presented for the 2018 budget deficit in order for it to meet the target figure. In the audit’s draft version, officials under Englman told The Marker, they had written conclusions saying Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and the ministry’s director-general, Shai Babad, exerted pressure on their subordinates to delay the publication of the budget deficit until after this year’s April elections over fears that the number would not play well for Kahlon’s Kulanu party at the polls.

The comptroller staffers were shocked to learn that the final version of the report sent to the Prime Minister’s Office included no mention of the allegations against Kahlon and Babad, according to the report.

Last week, meanwhile, an official in Englman’s office told the Calcalist business daily that his boss had scrapped a chapter from an annual audit addressing complaints made by Palestinians against officers in the Defense Ministry’s Civil Administration operating in the West Bank. According to the official, Englman decided to deviate from the policy of his predecessors on the matter by claiming that his office did not have authority to audit bodies beyond the Green Line — a peculiar position for an appointee of a right-wing government, which has worked over the years to normalize Israel’s presence in the West Bank.

This followed an earlier report in The Marker alleging that Englman softened and delayed the publication of an audit into the Cable and Satellite Broadcasting Council and the Second Authority for Television and Radio, which dealt with political appointees made at the two bodies by then-communication minister Ayoub Kara.

A phone call recording between Kara and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaked to Channel 13 earlier this year exposed the premier’s deep involvement in media issues, despite his having relinquished the communications portfolio in 2017 amid an ongoing criminal investigation into his alleged collusion with major media outlets. The draft version of the comptroller report that Englman received from his predecessor, Yosef Shapira, would have further implicated the prime minister in misconduct surrounding media issues, the official who spoke to The Marker indicated.

‘Misrepresenting reality’

As such reports against Englman’s conduct have continued to pile up in business dailies, Englman found himself forced to issue a rare statement on Sunday addressing the allegations directly.

“The media stories criticizing the audit work of the state comptroller are a distortion of reality that diminishes public confidence in the office’s work as well as the ministries being audited before a single [comptroller’s] report has even been published,” he said. “When the reports are released, it will be proven to everyone that they are very significant and effective reports that reveal significant deficiencies along with recommendations for public bodies to enact.”

Englman went on to assert that no report was being “shelved or censored,” but that he refused to act as a rubber stamp with regards to audits that were carried out under his predecessor but that had not yet been published. The comptroller said it was his duty to review those reports in their entirety before signing off on them and that in some cases he has asked staffers to “provide clarification, additional information and if necessary, to deepen the factual basis [of their conclusions].”

‘Atmosphere of fear’

The former official in the comptroller’s office who spoke to The Times of Israel dismissed Englman’s defense.

“People there tell me things are even worse than what’s being reported,” he said.

He pointed to the ombudsman’s new “constructive criticism” policy, which requires staffers to include in their audits of government offices, as proof that Englman was not interested in keeping a tight leash on the ministries he is mandated to inspect.

“Whereas once the ministries feared the State Comptroller’s Office, now the office’s employees fear the comptroller,” the former official summarized.

Citing the letter sent by the director-general warning staffers against speaking to the press, the former official described an “atmosphere of fear” that has taken hold since Englman began his tenure, in which staffers who have worked in the State Comptroller’s Office for years are now afraid for their jobs.

The former official went on to argue that Englman has been carrying out the will of the prime minister, who worked aggressively to ensure his appointment.

For example, the ex-comptroller staffer cited a rare meeting between Englman and Netanyahu, after which the ombudsman announced a shakeup of the committee tasked with ruling on whether the premier can accept donations from tycoon allies to fund his legal defense.

“He’s doing exactly what Netanyahu has asked of him,” the former official concluded.

Englman, for his part, has insisted that the leaks against him are politically motivated. When his first batch of reports are published by March 10 — a week after the general election — all the hubbub, he says, will turn out to have been for naught."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Statistics obtained by the RAC Foundation showed more than 40,000 drivers were caught by officers in 2018/19.

Cumbria came 28th on the list of 39 police forces who provided data.

The county’s police and crime commissioner Peter McCall condemned speeding drivers.

He said: “Speeding is particularly dangerous in Cumbria because most of our roads are single track.

“The message is clear: speeding is not acceptable and it often leads to tragic accidents.

“People need to know that speed limits are there to keep people safe.”

Analysis revealed that speeding accounted for more than four out of five detected motoring offences across the country.

Some 2.39 million drivers were caught speeding in England and Wales in 2018/19, according to a study.

This was a four per cent increase on the previous 12 months and a 37 per cent rise compared with 2011/12.

A total of 2.84 million motoring offences were recorded in 2018/19, meaning speeding accounted for 84 per cent.

The majority (97 per cent) of speeding incidents involved drivers being caught by camera.

Researchers suggested variations across forces were partly due to geographical area, road type, traffic volume and local policing priorities. Government figures show 186 people were killed and 1,505 seriously injured on Britain’s roads in 2018."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
9284,00ae0ead0cc429020fbdc3a92e5ab5ac,"Pope Francis, in a recent video posted on social media, appeared visibly disgruntled as he had to pull himself away from a woman in a crowd in St Peter's Square on Tuesday after she grabbed his hand and yanked him towards her. The incident occurred when the pontiff was in Vatican City greeting pilgrims on his way to see the Nativity scene put up in the cobbled esplanade, reports state.

Francis was greeting children, and reaching out to shake their hands when a woman standing nearby seized his hand as he was about to turn away and pulled him towards her. The gesture appeared to cause him pain as he jerked his hand free with a slap on the woman's hands. The woman reportedly had made the sign of the cross as Francis was heading towards her. However, it is not yet clear what was she saying to the pope as she attempted to pull him towards her.

Pope Francis' stroll reportedly left most tourists and Romans gathered there delighted apart from the brief upset, which showed the pontiff being angry for a few seconds in a rare public exhibit of the emotion.

People gathered to meet the pope shouted ""Happy New Year!"" and ""Pope! Pope!"" as they rushed to catch a glimpse of him. Francis, at a New Year's Eve Vespers service in St. Peter's Basilica, addressed the people there, urging them to practice more solidarity and ""build bridges, not walls."" His statement was an apparent reference to President Donald Trump's ongoing construction of the infamous border wall along the US-Mexico border, with an aim to keep illegal immigrants at bay.

Francis, last month, had also appeared to compare President Trump to King Herod, who massacred innocent children in ancient Palestine while attempting to kill baby Jesus, according to a Jesuit journal. The pontiff made the statement while addressing his brother Jesuits during his recent visit to Thailand. Francis reportedly slammed Trump and his administration in his thinly-veiled condemnation, suggesting Trump, like a modern-day Herod, was separating families at the border while allowing drugs to freely flow into the country.

Portrait of Emperor Nicholas I by Franz Krüger

Hermitage Museum

""Where the Russian flag was raised once, it should never be taken down,"" this emperor of Russia said in 1850, when there was a dispute on whether Russia should keep the remote island of Sakhalin, where explorer Gennady Nevelskoy had founded a military settlement.

It could trigger serious territorial disputes with China and Japan, so some of the officials considered such a step dangerous, but Nicholas I made it very clear - Russia will never surrender the lands it considers her own.

Alexander II on ruling the country

Portrait of Emperor Alexander II

National Archives of Canada

""It is not difficult to rule Russia, but it is useless,"" Alexander II once said, referring to the fact that Russia is so huge and chaotic that controlling it all is rather senseless, those subjects of his will always act irrespective of where the power is situated. Of course, Alexander II also performed one of the most ambitious reforms of the 19th century when he abolished serfdom (though it was not a huge success, here's why).

Alexander III on Europe and the Constitution

Emperor Alexander III

Sergey Levitsky/The Royal Collection Trust

""When the Russian tsar is fishing, Europe can wait,"" the emperor said. The thing was that Russia's foreign minister, worried by the diplomatic conflict in Europe concerning Russia's ally France, sent Alexander a letter while the emperor was resting in his country house, asking him to hurry back to the capital and tend to the crisis in order to avoid a war in Europe.

Alexander, irritated that someone is distracting him from his favorite hobby, sent a harsh response to his official. It quickly became one of the most famous (and badass) quotations to ever come from a Russian emperor.

The emperor was pretty sure that both foreigners and Russians should respect the status of a tsar. In 1881, soon after inheriting the throne from his murdered father, Alexander said, referring to demands to give the people a Constitution: ""A constitution? You want a Russian tsar to swear allegiance to some scum?""

Nicholas II on his occupation

""The Owner of the Russian land,"" - that was how Nicholas II filled in the ""occupation"" paragraph during the national census of 1897. Simple and elegant. This of course changed20 years later, when the Bolsheviks came, and Nicholas ended up owning nothing.

Vladimir Lenin on necrophilia

Vladimir Lenin in 1918

Peter Otsup/Sputnik

""Any kind of god is ideological necrophilia,"" Vladimir Lenin, the creator and first ruler of the USSR, wrote in his letter to Maxim Gorky. A hardcore atheist, anti-capitalist and anti-monarchist, Lenin hated any kind of religion, considering it, just like his teacher Karl Marx, ""opium of the people"".

When the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, had seized power in Russia, they started a crusade against religion, burning down churches and imprisoning priests. Paradoxically, after his death, Lenin's body was put into the Mausoleum, turning him into some kind of a saint in an atheist country.

Joseph Stalin on cheerfulness, war and the Pope

Josef Stalin

Shagin/Sputnik

""Life has become better, comrades. Life has become more cheerful,"" Stalin said in 1935, referring to the rise of the Stakhanovite worker movement and the general improvement of living standards.

Nevertheless, this phrase sounds far grimmer today. Stalin said it just two years prior to the Great Purge of 1936-1938, when around seven million people were arrested, and hundreds of thousands killed. There was little to be ""cheerful"" about, to put it mildly.

During the Second World War Stalin translated the feelings of a nation at war. The most famous quote of his from that period went as follows: ""Not one step back! Such should now be our main slogan."" Running from battle was really not an option back then!

Once, while speaking to Britain's Prime Minister William Churchill, who mentioned the moral influence of the Pope on catholic Poland (where the Red Army was fighting back then), Stalin, according to the memoirs of his translator, reacted with a question: ""And how many divisions doesPope command?"".

Nikita Khrushchev on burying the West and diplomacy

Nikita Khrushchev

Valentin Sobolev/TASS

""We will bury you!"" is perhaps one of the most ominous warnings ever uttered by Khrushchev, one that had quickly gone viral in the West, as the Soviet leader said it while talking to Western ambassadors in 1956.

Actually, the meaning was not as dark as it sounds: Khrushchev didn't mean destroying the West in a war, he was talking about the communist system prevailing worldwide, and therefore ""burying"" the capitalist one (that turned out well). But taken out of context by the press, it shocked pretty much everyone.

Generally, Khrushchev - a man of the people and not a very diplomatic person - liked to speak his mind. When Anwar Sadat, the president of Egypt, changed sides in the Cold War, befriending the U.S., and then asked through a mediator to have a talk with Khrushchev, the Soviet leader reacted: ""I wouldn't sh*t with the guy (Sadat) in the same field!"", and demanded the interpreter to translate his words directly.

Mikhail Gorbachev on *ssholes

Mikhail Gorbachev

Gorbachev was far more diplomatic than Khrushchev, but sometimes he also could sound pretty irritated. When facing a coup attempt in August 1991, just months before the USSR ceased to exist, he had to welcome the would-be-junta members, his colleagues in the communist elite, at his residence in Crimea. By that time, it was obvious that the coup had failed, so Gorbachev, very pissed off, welcomed them with the following words: ""So, did you have your fun, you *ssholes?"" When asked later whether he had honestly used the phrase, Gorbachev said: ""It was the most polite possible words to say to them.""

9502,c8f323fce0e246a8cf95eb74a7f094d0,"By Shreen Abdul Saroor –

As 2019 winds down and the democratic space quickly closes around us, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the past year and the monumental human rights challenges ahead.

Nothing much happened after rescuing the country from a constitutional coup. The PM forgot why the masses protested and why MPs joined before the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal to reinstate him. Meanwhile, Sirisena became a lame duck. Ignoring warnings from international intelligence agencies, local officers, and the Muslim community (especially in Kathankuddy), over 260 Catholic and Christian worshipers, tourists and locals were murdered on Easter Sunday. As a direct result of their unforgivable lapse, Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe have brought our country to its present abyss.

Everything changed after the Easter attacks. Overnight, the entire Muslim community was labeled terrorists, with every Muslim made to feel responsible for the Easter attacks. We saw raids, insults, random arrests, and detentions simply because one believed in Islam or had a Muslim name. Vigilante mobs burned and raided Muslim villages, destroying homes, businesses, schools, and mosques. Refugees and asylum seekers were evicted and left with no place to go. Rumors targeted Muslim doctors and professionals, with one doctor arrested and accused of sterilizing Sinhala women—a charge his captors are still seeking to substantiate to justify his arrest. A group of unelected violent “monks” forced the mass resignation of Muslim Ministers, State and Deputy Ministers.

As always, Muslim women suffered the most. Niqab-wearing women still have no access to public spaces. Since the Emergency Regulation ban and J.J. Rathnasiri (now secretary to the justice and human rights ministry) signed the government circular, these women have faced constant harassment and intimidation. Families detained for their supposed links to the banned terrorist group SLNTJ are housed in squalor, with surveillance and social ostricisation leaving women and children particularly at risk.

Mr. Sirisena insulted the Presidential pardon to the level, the women’s groups that opposed the death penalty are now compelled to challenge the possibility of a rehabilitation for criminals convicted for grave offences. Pardoning Gnanasara, who was convicted for contempt of court, was not only an abuse of power but was a slap on the face of the judiciary

The Easter attacks paved the way for Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s victory. Since then, civil society groups have been under constant surveillance. There was quiet monitoring before, but it is now so visible, so blatant, so threatening. NGOs have been compelled to submit all kinds of information —not just the program, donor, and staff information requested in the past, but particulars of community-level activists and their immediate family members. With media outlets and social media carefully monitored for any signs of dissent, civil society and journalists have self-censored their words and actions. Women’s activists who worked on projects to reconcile, counsel, memorilise and lobby the government to reform unequal laws or discriminatory practices are now stranded. Those assisting families of the disappeared to approach the government-established Office of Missing Persons (OMP) face even more overt intimidation. A handful of brave women lawyers now fear for their family members’ safety. Some OMP commissioners wonder if they should quit or wait until they are forced out. The victim in the landmark military rape case has apparently gone into hiding despite her resilient nature in withstanding severe harassment and intimidation to have named the perpetrators probably in fear of further intimidation. Her appeal is before the Supreme Court.

A female staffer in the Swiss Embassy was abducted, held against her wishes and allegedly molested. The government took her information and has since charged her with ‘bringing the government to disaffection’ and imprisoned her. Treason! Many shuddered, but few felt brave enough to speak. Her story sends a dark message: if you are abducted and molested, keep quiet. If you speak about human rights violations, you are a liar and a traitor peddling a foreign conspiracy. “Be a patriot and support country’s development. Do not talk about justice or accountability. Past is past” is now the survival mantra. Militant Buddhist monks and former Army men will be correcting us if we do not obey. Already there are videos of supposed monks slapping and degrading Christian pastors for conducting prayers. This is our new reality.

With the situation deteriorating, it is disheartening to see the international community taking a break from transitional justice and reassessing the situation. Although the Swiss embassy staffer’s case is being pursued, foreign diplomats are heard to say that in a democracy, voters decide a country’s path. Indeed, Sri Lanka is not the only country dealing with Islamophobia in Asia. What started in Myanmar with making Rohingyas stateless has spread to similar anti-Muslim Hindutva efforts in India. Here, as there, majoritarian politics will trample minority rights.

So where to from here?

On Muslim human rights, MP Athuraliye Rathana is to bring (already gazetted) a private member Bill to abolish Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act. This will force the hand of progressive Muslims, who have fought for years to reform the archaic Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) to respect the rights of Muslim women and girls. These efforts were thwarted when Mr. Wickremesinghe, our first female justice minister Thalatha Atukorale, Muslim MPs, and communal-minded and backward-thinking Muslim men allied with ACJU split the recommendations made by Justice Saleem Marsoof’s committee. Now, to oppose Rathana’s racist Bill, all may have to join hands with the spoilers of reform—the ACJU and regressive Muslim politicians and individuals—to defend the very law that women have vehemently been opposing.

On transitional justice, 2020 will see a complete rollback of efforts to deal with the past. The two transitional justice mechanisms in place—the OMP and Office of Reparations are stalling (with those who have engaged now at risk), while the remaining two mechanisms will never materialize. The President has already declared the U.N. Human Rights Council irrelevant, and his administration might table a resolution in the upcoming February 28th HRC session seeking to walk back prior commitments.

Domestically, we may lose our hard-won 19th Amendment to the Constitution. The TNA will pay the price, with Karuna, Pillaiyan, other extreme Tamil nationalists, standing to gain in upcoming elections. It is likely to be so with the Muslims; moderates likely to lose the leverage. The April parliamentary elections are critical for women and minorities. If one party achieves a 2/3 majority with a weak showing by minority parties, that will only strengthen the power already concentrating in the Rajapaksa brothers’ hands. Before long, the military will be back in civil administration from running government offices to sweeping the parks and clearing drainage. The worst excesses of the Rajapaksa years, from corruption to silencing dissent, likely to return.

The only glimmer of hope is in the power of the human spirit. As walls close around us, mothers and wives of the disappeared in the north, east and south are resilient. On December 30, they held their usual month-end protests. Sandhya Ekneligoda continues to appear in courtrooms to pursue her husband’s disappearance even as the chief investigator, who has been investigating the disappearance, has fled the country. She now heavily relies on the witnesses to testify at the trail to prove her husband’s abduction. It is too much to ask of ordinary people to put their lives, their children, and their staff at risk day in, day out. But the persistence of those brave souls who continue to speak the truth and demand justice gives me hope that the struggle will continue, and the people will persevere."," Threaten, not specified below",3

PROGENITOR and one of the founders of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mr. Emeka Emekesiri has cautioned the large followers of Biafra freedom fighters to be patient and to follow the due process of self-determination in the new year.

Emekesiri in a new year message on behalf of the Supreme Council of Elders and the Customary Government of IPOB asked his people to ignore tissues of lies and propaganda by some conspicuous members and follow the legal rules of engagement in the re-actualistion of a sovereign state of Biafra, which he reminded that its process is already before a competent court of jurisdiction in Nigeria.

Describing the year 2020 as a year of national liberation and freedom, Emekesiri noted that the benefit of the legal methodology and political diplomacy in the struggle for self-determination cannot be over-emphasized. “Everything in life has a process,” he said.

He gave posthumous New Year wishes to late four IPOB pillars- Brig Gen Joe Achuzia; Chief Barr Debe Odumegwu Ojukwu; Dr Dozie Ikedife and the Chairman of IPOB Supreme Council of Elders, His Royal Majesty, Hon Justice Eze Ozobu, noting that the sages fought a good fight within seven years of establishment of IPOB. “These men fought the good fight and handed the baton to us to continue from where they stopped,” Emekesiri eulogized.

On the IPOB agenda, Emekesiri said “In the first seven years of our struggle by legal methodology from 2012 to 2019, we made great impact and achieved great success in the struggle for our self-determination. The struggle by due process commenced with the publication of the book, Biafra or Nigerian Presidency- What the Ibos Want, published in 2012 where the name, Indigenous People of Biafra, was created and used to sue the Nigerian Government in a representative capacity in the Suit No FHC/OW/CS/102/2012 in the Federal High Court Owerri. The case was reconstituted in 2013 as Suit No FHC/OW/CS/192/2013 which was later transferred to Abuja.

“We have entered a new year and cannot afford to continue with the mistakes of the past. Those who were promised by their leaders that Biafra would come in 2015 have seen that it was a lie. Those who were promised the Referendum for Biafran Independence in 2017 have seen that it was a lie. Those who were told that the United Nations and the European Parliament have recognised Biafra have seen that it was a lie. Everything has a process and we advise all the Biafrans to be patient and follow the due process of self-determination.

“Unfortunately, we have observed that many Biafrans are impatient to follow the due process. They want Biafra today or tomorrow and will swallow all lies and deceptions in the name of Biafra. We have even heard that some Biafra Groups have appointed or declared their Presidents of Biafra and the Ministers of the Republic of Biafra. They have turned the Biafran Struggle into childish jokes and business enterprises and brought ridicules to the Struggle.

“We have forgiven everybody who offended us and do hereby ask for forgiveness from those who we offended. If we cannot work together because of individual preferences of likes and dislikes, or because of incompatible behaviours and ways of life, we can at least work separately in love towards the same goal without destroying each other, without lying and backbiting against each other and without constituting a stumbling block on the way of others.

“This is unity in diversity, being different in styles and approaches but pursuing the same objective with love for one another. With this attitude of love in mind, we welcome you to the New Year of our National Liberation- our year of freedom.”

He also pointed to Republic Act No. 8975 that bans all courts (except the Supreme Court) from issuing TROs or preliminary injunctions against infrastructure projects of the national government.

However, the ban will not apply ""when the matter is of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a temporary restraining order is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will arise,"" according to Section 3 of the law.

Nine people died after Indonesia’s capital was hit by its deadliest flooding in years, authorities said Wednesday, as torrential rains on New Year’s Eve left vast swathes of the megalopolis submerged.

Thousands were evacuated to temporary shelters as electricity was switched off in scores of waterlogged neighbourhoods across greater Jakarta, home to about 30 million people, with some train lines and one of the city’s airports also shut.

Indonesia’s National Disaster Mitigation Agency called on residents to leave flood-hit areas.

“The first priority is saving lives,” said agency head Doni Monardo.

A 16-year-old was electrocuted by a power line, while three more people died of hypothermia, according to the disaster agency.

“My son’s body was covered with newspaper when my two other children passed by,” said Fadrid, who identified himself as the dead teen’s father.

“People asked them whether they knew the victim. If they hadn’t been passing by, we wouldn’t have known my son had been killed,” he told AFP.

Among the victims was an elderly couple trapped inside their home in a district where floodwaters reached as high as four metres (13 feet) after a river burst its banks.

Another victim drowned while four people were killed after the Tuesday evening downpour triggered landslides in the city’s outskirts.

“We have shut down power (in many areas) to avoid more electrical shocks,” Ikhsan Asaad, an official at state firm PLN, told AFP.

Asaad said he could not estimate how many residents had been affected by the power shutdown.

“We’re currently focusing on taking measures to ensure people’s safety,” he added.

Angelina Widiyanti was among scores of residents whose houses were flooded with their possessions ruined by the disaster.

“We’ve had flooding several times before but it was never this high,” she said from her home, where the power had been cut.

“We weren’t prepared for this.”

Authorities said about 19,000 people were evacuated, but that figure did not include residents in Jakarta’s satellite cities.

“We’re evacuating people right now,” Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan told reporters.

“Everyone living near rivers should anticipate (more) flooding,” he added.

Images from across the region showed waterlogged homes and cars submerged in muddy floodwaters, while some people took to paddling in small rubber lifeboats or tyre inner-tubes to get around.

The disaster marked Jakarta’s worst flooding since 2013 when several dozen people were killed when the city was inundated by monsoon rains.

Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during Indonesia’s rainy season, which started in late November.

On Wednesday, service at Halim Perdanakusuma airport, which handles commercial and military planes, was temporarily shut due to severe flooding on its runways, according to the transport ministry.

Many flights were transferred to Jakarta’s main Soekarno–Hatta International Airport.

NEW HAVEN — A Guatemalan teenager living in New Haven has been released from custody after being granted asylum by a Boston immigration judge.

18-year-old Mario Aguilar has been detained by authorities for more than three months. Aguilar was a Wilbur Cross High School student.

Aguila has now returned home.

Aguilar came to the U.S. from Guatemala in 2018 to flee threats from gangs that tried to recruit him, his lawyers said. ICE took Aguilar into custody at Milford Superior Court in September when he showed up for a court date to answer to six motor vehicle charges. He was arrested for DUI in West Haven after crashing an unregistered, uninsured car and leaving the accident scene while driving with no license.

“The judge did find that [Aguilar] had been persecuted in Guatemala and that he had a well-founded fear of being persecuted if he went back there, so so gave him asylum,” Dalia Fuleihan, Aguilar’s attorney said.

Winneba (C/R), Jan. 1, GNA - Mr Johnson Asiedu Nketia, General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), has described the country’s laws on political party financing and campaigning as vague and called for it to be strengthened.



He said the laws must be expanded to set limit of funding for every parliamentary candidate during an election and also demand that they declared their sources of funding.

“The campaign financing laws must be specific as to which activities can be financed, how much to spend on each activity and must make it mandatory for candidates to disclose their sources of funding”, he said.

Additionally, he said, the assets declaration laws are a “useless ritual” without any proper significance and called for its review.

Mr Asiedu Nketia made the call at Winneba on Tuesday when he took his turn to address the 38th anniversary of the 31st December Revolution on the theme, “Monetization of Elections in Ghana: ‘A threat to National Development and Genuine Democracy”.

He also called for a second look at the chunk of money spent on internal elections of political parties saying sufficient budget must be made available to the Electoral Commission (EC) to organise and supervise such elections.

This, he said, would stop political parties from charging filing fees from aspirants to help reduce the cost of seeking political position and ultimately reduce corruption and the monetization in the body politic of the country which had made politics very expensive.

Brigadier General Nunoo Mensah, former Chief of Defense Staff, said politics was not a business venture which politicians could use to enrich themselves, but an avenue for decent people who have genuine desire and the calling to serve their people in order to improve their quality of life.

Regrettably, he said, the very ills of corruption, bad governance, mismanagement, gross indiscipline among others which the revolution was against continued unabated.

He called for a new national movement which would inculcate the ideals and values of the 31st December Revolution into Ghanaians in order to be able to bring about the desired change to build a genuine democracy.

10105,eb12f0c0eaa9c606c97ebdcc248e2474,"For many people, the holidays are about family and home. Loved ones gathered over home-cooked meals, exuding warmth, their embrace offering a brief respite from the hardships of life.

In the diaspora, one yearns for home and seeks to recreate it in familiar rituals. A pot roast, perhaps. A midnight prayer maybe or a candle with a familiar scent. Eventually a past that can only be imitated with imperfection gives way to your own creation, your own rituals and traditions, your very own new home.

I was contemplating these ideas of home this week as further news emerged of the tragedy of Idlib, a province in northwestern Syria that is under renewed attack by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Al Assad and his allies, a final paroxysm of violence before the new year.

Idlib is one of the last remaining areas outside of Mr Al Assad’s control, as his forces have clawed back territory from rebels all over the country during the last three years. The province is controlled by rebel groups, the most powerful of which is Hayat Tahrir Al Sham, who are jihadists with links to Al Qaeda. But Idlib is also home to three million civilians, half of whom are so-called internally displaced people – basically refugees in their own country. Three quarters of them are women and children.

Mr Al Assad has repeatedly vowed to wrest back Idlib, which is on the border with Turkey. So the latest offensive, which began on December 16 despite a ceasefire negotiated by Ankara and Moscow being officially in place, comes as no surprise. It has been in the works for years. It will culminate in an orgy of violence and war crimes by Mr Al Assad and his allies, and hand-wringing by an international community now used to turning a blind eye to human rights abuses. Nothing will be done.

Civilians flee a Syrian military offensive in Idlib province near Hazano, Syria, December 24, 2019. AP

But one figure in the flurry of UN statistics over the past few days stopped me in my tracks. Throughout the month of December, around 284,000 people in Idlib province fled their homes, moving north towards the Turkish border. Maarat Al Numan, a historic town that withstood years of indiscriminate bombardment, has been largely emptied of its inhabitants.

In a single month, more than a quarter of a million people, around 80 per cent of whom were women and children, picked up what few belongings they had remaining or could carry away and left their homes in the dead of winter and under torrential rains, probably never to return, their homes and dreams crushed by the advancing war machine.

Some of Idlib’s displaced have already been forced to move twice, three times, some even ten times. Many of those living in the province moved there after Mr Al Assad’s forces took over other parts of the country, fearing disappearance and torture in the regime’s sadistic network of dungeons or being drafted into the military to battle their brethren.

But now they have nowhere left to run. The Turkish border is closed, with Ankara having decided that it was no longer politically feasible to accept more refugees. So Idlib’s refugees are trapped in an ever-shrinking plot of land, barred from flight. Even humanitarian relief is denied, because cross-border aid has been vetoed by Russia and China, but largely because human decency was also a casualty of nine years of war in Syria.

The plight of Idlib’s civilians exposes another phenomenon of the past decade – the inexorable rise of the anti-immigrant populists in Europe, the US and beyond. They lied to their citizens, warning them against the impending deluge of brown people who were coming for their jobs, who would transform their neighbourhoods and nation-states, impose foreign codes of behaviour, overthrow the established order and pollute their societies.

They lied because the overwhelming majority of those who sought refuge across border fences, who drowned in the Aegean and the Mediterranean, who endured the humiliations of the enlightened world’s xenophobes and racists, were just like Idlib’s displaced. They fled chemical weapons, torture, indiscriminate bombing, starvation sieges and more. They cradled an idea of home in their minds to a safer place where it could be rebuilt.

One can only hope that in the new year those homes will grow to resemble the real thing, and that Idlib’s displaced will find the refuge they so desperately need. They are the closest physically among Syria’s refugees to their own homes. But as the new year dawns, they are the furthest from that ideal and dream."," Threaten, not specified below",3

10147,675ad3982a6f695a4fe3f670fd2fe6a5,"“Enforcement time” has come for motorists caught texting and driving by Florida Highway Patrol troopers.

The arrival of the 2020 brings a handful of changes stemming from the 2019 legislative session, including final pieces of enforcing a new law that cracks down on texting and driving. Starting Wednesday, the highway patrol will join other law-enforcement agencies in issuing tickets, instead of warnings, to motorists stopped for texting while driving.

“There’s going to always be education going on, however now it’s going to be enforcement time,” Lt. Derrick Rahming of the highway patrol said. “We never want anyone to learn the hard way, so we gave everyone six months to learn about this law. But, now come Jan. 1, it’s a primary offense and we are going to start issuing citations.”

The new year also will usher in other changes passed during the spring legislative session, including part of a tax package that required a reduction in a tax that businesses pay on commercial leases.

As with the tax package, the bulk of the texting-while-driving law went into place July 1.

Florida in recent years has banned texting while driving, but it had been enforced as a “secondary” offense --- meaning motorists could only be cited for texting if they were stopped for other reasons such as speeding. But the new law (HB 107) made it a “primary” offense, allowing police to pull over motorists for texting behind the wheel.

The law also bars motorists from talking on cell phones in school and work zones, unless the motorists use “hands-free” electronic devices.

Law-enforcement agencies such as the highway patrol phased in enforcement of the law, with troopers issuing warnings to motorists before planning to start writing citations in 2020.

Tickets issued for a first offense carry a $30 fine plus court costs, which could reach $108.16. The fine jumps to $60 --- $158.18 with court costs --- for a second violation within five years.

Because of concerns the law could lead to racial profiling, officers are required to record the race and ethnicity of every violator.

Highway patrol troopers have issued about 800 warnings, which Rahming said shouldn’t be considered low.

“I think it’s right around where it needs to be,” Rahming said. “Throughout the state, we’ve had 1,151 citations issued (by all law enforcement) since the law started in July.”

Rahming said people putting down their phones while driving will make the roads safer.

“When you are sitting inside of a patrol car, you are going to see a lot of things. One of the things you will see is someone distracted in their vehicle,” Rahming said. “The number one thing we want to do is make sure everyone has their mind on driving and they are doing everything they need to, to make sure they are focused on driving.”

Among other changes taking effect Wednesday:

* As part of an $87 million tax relief package (HB 7123), a sales-tax rate on commercial leases will be trimmed from 5.7 percent to 5.5 percent. The reduction is expected produce a $30.8 million cut in state and local taxes in the remaining six months of the fiscal year. Over a full year, the savings are estimated at $64.5 million.

* A new law (HB 831) requires health care practitioners to transmit prescriptions electronically, with certain exceptions.

* A new law (HB 409), allows remote, online notarization of documents.

--- A new law (HB 427), establishes the Honor and Remember Flag, which will honor members of the military who have died in the line of duty. The law authorizes the flag to be flown at state buildings and by local governments on Veterans Day, Gold Star Mother’s Day or any day when a member of the military from Florida dies in the line of duty."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Philippa Ashford, 61, was shot and killed shortly after midnight in the Laurel Oaks Sub-division in Northwest Harris County. Ashford was in a cul-de-sac outside her son’s home, where she also once lived. At midnight, they decided to go outside and ring in the new year watching fireworks with family members and neighbors. Only minutes into 2020, Ashford suddenly yelled she was shot.



""Here we are on New Year's Day and we have a family waking up without the matriarch of their family,” says Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman.

The matriarch was a well-respected, award-winning nurse who held a master’s degree, taught at the University of Texas Health Science Center and was the nurse manager at Menninger Clinic. She was shot in the neck and died.



”Me and my son were out here popping fireworks when it happened,” says neighbor Melvin Green.



""There’s no indication anyone on that street was shooting guns so the investigation is going to continue,” adds Constable Herman, who says investigators are still trying to figure out where the bullet came from. ""There’s all indications that it is going to be celebratory gunfire. We have deputies canvassing the area right now still looking for evidence or witnesses.""



”People don’t have respect for other people, other people’s safety, for the law. It’s against the law to do it. They still continue to do it. It’s pretty sad,” says neighbor Jeremy Dabney.



Even as Harris County Precinct 4 deputies arrived on May Laurel Drive moments after the shooting, fireworks continued in the northwest Harris County neighborhood, where many had no idea someone was shot.

""My wife and I when we heard it this morning we prayed for the family,” says Dabney.



""This is probably my last time popping fireworks at night, especially with my son. It’s just not worth it,” adds Green.

The Menninger Clinic released a statement saying, ""The Menninger Clinic community is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Philippa “Phil” Ashford, who was a nurse manager at our hospital and served as a leader and mentor to our nursing and clinical team. Our hearts go out to her family and friends at this very sad time and we offer our support and deepest sympathy. Menninger will hold a memorial service to honor Philippa, whose loss as a talented professional and friend will be felt by all of us here at Menninger and across our local mental health community.”

10401,31dcbc02489d74d9b95fe5f789236775,"Cypriot court ‘failed to consider UK teen’s PTSD’

The Guardian





A British teenager found guilty by a Cypriot court of lying about being gang raped was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when she retracted her claims, but that was not fully taken into account during the trial, her psychologist said.

The 19-year-old needs urgent therapy to avoid “life-changing” damage, said Christine Tizzard, a chartered consultant psychologist who extensively assessed the woman for the defense.

The student was ruled by a judge in Cyprus to have willfully indulged in public mischief by claiming that she was raped by a group of Israeli males while on holiday in Ayia Napa in July last year.

British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Dominic Raab has promised to raise the “deeply distressing” case with the Cypriot government and contact has been made between officials from the two countries.

The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office earlier said that it was “seriously concerned” about the fairness of the trial.

The case against the Briton hinged on a statement retracting her original accusation, signed after hours of questioning by detectives in a police station that was neither recorded nor attended by a lawyer.

She said in court that the police had forced her to change her story, telling the judge that she was “scared for my life.”

“The salient point is that she was diagnosed with PTSD,” Tizzard said. “That’s a standalone diagnosis. It’s a valid diagnosis and it hasn’t really been fully represented.

“Aside the fact it hasn’t been fully represented, it means she’s been unable to get the treatment she so sorely needs, and every day she’s not having treatment, the worse it gets,” Tizzard said.

The psychologist, who gave evidence to one of the complainant’s court hearings in Cyprus in November, said that the teenager should be commended for how she had held up under the strain, but that her mental state has worsened over the past few months.

“I’m concerned that she needs robust and adequate therapy — and very, very quickly or there’s a real concern that this is going to be life-changing and remain that way,” she said.

The Cypriot government on Tuesday defended its police and judicial system amid growing concern about the fairness of a trial.

The woman, who has already spent more than a month in the Central Jail of Nicosia and has been prevented from leaving Cyprus since July, is to be sentenced on Tuesday next week and faces up to a year in prison and a ￡1,500 (US$1,990) fine.

Her defense team has said that it would appeal the verdict all the way to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.

The ruling by Michalis Papathanasiou, at Famagusta District Court in Paralimni, was strongly condemned by the woman’s lawyers, who claimed that the trial was full of legal irregularities, and sparked a backlash against an island reliant on international tourism.

Tizzard, who first assessed the woman in September and then about four weeks ago, said it was clear that the complainant was suffering from PTSD at the time that she retracted her claims to police, following seven hours of questioning without a lawyer or an interpreter.

“It was clear, and has been clear all along, that she’s suffering from severe, and I do mean severe, PTSD. She’s in a dreadful state — we’ve been worried about her for several months and how she has deteriorated,” Tizzard said.

People suffering from PTSD present differently at different times and become overwhelmed by difficult situations, causing them to react in unexpected ways, Tizzard said.

“They will very frequently feel such terror and discomfort, and they will quite literally go along with anything to get out of a situation that they find overwhelming,” Tizzard said. “My experience certainly of the teenager was, when talking to her, that she could change quite quickly, particularly if she was triggered by something that resembled the original trauma.”", Sexually assault,3

According to the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health, 48 girls and 47 boys were born on New Year's Day.

The department said a high profile delegation which included national health minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize and KZN premier Sihle Zikalala, had visited the King Dinzulu Hospital in Asherville where they handed out gifts to mothers and their newborns. Durban - A total of 95 babies were born in hospitals across KwaZulu-Natal on January 1. Earlier on Wednesday, The Mercury reported that 66 babies were born however, by 5pm, that number had increased.





Mkhize said he was pleased that the babies born on Wednesday received their birth certificates just hours after being born.





""We are putting this in place in a number of hospitals. By the time we institute the National Health Insurance, these children will be registered at birth and their parents will be a part of a national register. This means we will have the kind of healthcare that will see to it that people are given healthcare at the place and time that it is needed regardless of whether or not they can afford it. It will mean us doing a lot of work to upgrade the staff and facilities. We are starting this decade off by implementing these changes and improvements,"" he said.





Mkhize further warned parents to ensure that their children are immunised on time. He further shared on the current stage of the NHI process, explaining that there were still some provinces where still to undergo public hearings and then feedback to be given to parliament. Mkhize also shared on other developments in his department.

A Russian homoeopath has revealed that the best cure for a hangover is to take small doses of sodium thiosulfate, a remedy that is used by members of Russian intelligence agencies. Doctor Mikhail Looschik claims that sodium thiosulfate absorbs alcohol, preventing intoxication. The substance is used to cure alcoholism – long-term use of it makes a person develop an aversion to alcohol.

Doctor Looschik warned against overdoing sodium thiosulfate, as in big doses it has side effects like diarrhoea and nausea. For those who prefer a less drastic solution, the homeopath advised drinking large amounts of water both while consuming alcohol and the morning after.

Scientists have long grappled with how to cure hangovers, but research has failed to provide a universal solution. What we do know is that it causes inflammation and dehydration, which in tandem create this horrible condition, ranging from splitting headaches and vomiting, to excessive thirst and muscle aches.

Here are a few tips that could help you, perhaps not get rid of your hangover, but at least minimise its effect:

Don’t drink

Haha, we're pulling your leg. Scroll down.

Eat lots of food

Especially greasy food. The logic is simple – a full stomach slows down the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream. Consuming fat food can also help the morning after. Germans, for example, resort to katerfruhstuck, or hangover breakfast in German, which includes rollmops, fillets of pickled herring wrapped around pickled fillings.

Drink lots of water

Here the logic is even simpler. To prevent dehydration caused by a hangover, one needs to drink water. The general rule of thumb is one glass of water for every drink.

Avoid dark beverages

That includes liquors, red wine, and whisky. They contain congeners that help provide flavour, but are said to contribute to hangovers.

Don’t smoke or do drugs at the same time

Combining things that can mess with your body is not something one should do, researchers say.

Get sleep

Whether you finished partying or woke up with a splitting headache, scientists say that the morning after you need to get plenty of sleep and, of course, we are talking about sleeping in your bed in a comfortable position and not hunched up on a bench or on a floor with dozens of friends lying next to you."," Threaten, not specified below",3
10437,8272ee2e9d15dadc145a4538694d5df8,"UFC boss Dana White is urging Conor McGregor to hit the brakes on his plan to fight welterweight standout Jorge Masvidal because the organization's 'BMF' could distract the Irishman from his business in the lightweight division, RT reports.

McGregor is due to return to the UFC cage in January for a welterweight bout against Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone, in what will be the former two-division UFC champion's first fight since being submitted by 155lb champion Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018.

But the Dubliner's plans for 2020 also involve a sequel to his blood feud with his Russian rival, along with a potential bout with the consensus fighter of the year in Masvidal.

However, with McGregor understood to be next in line for a title bout in the lightweight fold should he get past the experienced Cerrone on January 18, White says that he would be best served waiting for his opportunity against the winner of the upcoming Nurmagomedov vs. Tony Ferguson fight rather than casting glances towards the 170lb field.

""Conor has this idea, too, that if things don't go his way and he [doesn't] get the fight [with Khabib], he'll have had a 170 fight in his pocket again and [is] considering a [Jorge] Masvidal fight,"" White said to ESPN.

""I think everybody knows what I think about it. I think it's a bad idea. Conor gets pissed off when I say it's a bad idea, and he's like, ""You think I can't beat Masvidal?"" I'm not saying you can't beat Masvidal. Anybody can beat anybody on any given day, but why? Why go after that fight when you could possibly just wait?"""," Threaten, not specified below",3
10450,e6e965a7724c3cbccd5fd8c69d79e249,"Any militant attack on Indian forces in Kashmir could set off an escalation between India and Pakistan, the Crisis Group has warned in its report.

In its report titled “10 conflicts to watch in 2020”, the group said the insurgents were lying low in Kashmir but they were still active.

“India’s heavy-handed military operations in Kashmir over the past few years have inspired a new homegrown generation, whose ranks are likely to swell further after the latest repression,” the report said.

Indian fighter planes had violated Pakistani space after a militant attack that killed at least 40 paramilitary soldiers in Pulwama on February 19, 2019. In retaliation, Pakistan had shot down two Indian jets over Kashmir on February 27 and captured an Indian pilot as well. He, however, was released by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government as a “gesture of peace”.

The Crisis Group warned that any Pulwama-like attack on Indian forces in Kashmir would precipitate Indian action against Pakistan.

“In a worst-case scenario, the two nuclear-armed neighbours could stumble into war,” the report said.

The Crisis Group asked New Delhi to lift the communication blackout and release political prisoners in the India-administered part of the Kashmir valley. It also asked Pakistan to take action against militants allegedly operating from its soil.

The Crisis Group further urged the international community to push Pakistan and India for talks “before it is too late”.

10457,aedcd27c64096887eef923dfe24d0ad9,"Somali militant group al-Shabaab may be profiting from political uncertainties facing the country as it heads into stricter transition timelines that are supposed to culminate in an election later in the year.

And experts say the group, which had largely been disorganised through a relentless aerial drone attacks, is getting a lifeline from proxy wars playing out among Somalia's partners.

Seventy-two hours after the deadly attack in Mogadishu last Saturday, the local intelligence agency (NISA) claimed ""a foreign country"" had a hand in plotting for the attack, which al-Shabaab acknowledged committing.

PLOTTED ATTACK

NISA, now headed by former minister and journalist Fahad Yasin Dahir, did not name the actual country that plotted the attack or give proof in public. And Somali government officials were indicating the attack should not be judged as Shabab's stronger re-emergence.

But observers said the mere mention of an external entity as fuelling local terrorism could indicate Somalia's politics was not being controlled internally.

""If you ask me what is the problem with Somalia? My answer is Saudi Arabia and UAE; and everybody else is an agent or chance profiteer,"" argued Farah Maalim, former deputy speaker of Kenyan Parliament, now a law scholar at the University of Nairobi.

""[The] reasons, oil/gas scare for Saudis and global transit traffic for Dubai. If Somalia develops its oil/gas and modern ports on East Coast, Saudi and UAE will lose.""

To be fair, both the UAE and Saudi governments issued statements condemning the attack and the Somali government neither mentioned the two nor provided public evidence suggesting they may have helped plot the incident.

CRIMINAL ACT

In a statement attributed to Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the Foreign and International Cooperation Minister, the UAE called the attack a ""criminal act"" and said his country joins the rest in fighting against all forms of violence and terrorism.

But the UAE and Saudi Arabia have mostly been one side on Somalia, often competing against Turkey and Qatar on the other.

In July, the New York Times reported what it called an intercepted phone conversation implicating Qatar of using al-Shabaab to carry out a terror attack against a port run by the UAE in Somalia. Doha refuted the claims, but experts say it pointed to an increasing use of hired thugs to supplant rivals.

""There are no questions about that (proxy wars in Somalia) and Shabaab's thrive in chaos,"" Dr Abdiwahab Sheikh Abdisamad, head of Southlink Consultants and a commentator on Horn of Africa politics told the Nation.

""Al-Shabaab is a gun for hire. Anybody can use them for their political advantage. With this, they could scare Turks out of town. They could play political role if their master has a common enemy with them,"" he argued but warned such a strategy is not sustainable as the group has no long-term loyalty to any of the Middle Eastern powers.

Ali Muhamad Dhere, the presumed Shabaab spokesman said on Monday they had targeted a Turkish convoy of contractors in Mogadishu who they called an ""enemy."" But the car bomb explosion killed 85 people, including two Turkish nationals.

HUMANITARIAN SCENE

Turkey has been in Mogadishu's humanitarian scene since 2011, supplying relief, building a hospital, erecting the largest embassy and training Somalia's National Army (SNA). It airlifted 16 of the injured survivors for treatment. Qatar transported another 22 to Doha.

Under President Mohamed Farmaajo's government, both Turkey and Qatar have thrived as UAE ran out of favours, stopped training the army and pulled plugs on various aid projects. Farmaajo refused to take sides in the Gulf blockade on Qatar, despite pressure from Saudis and UAE.

On Monday, Somalia's opposition figures claimed the suggestion of a foreign entity may be premature and argued the government was passing the buck.

""Al-Shabaab has benefited from the failure of the current government. That comes from bad political strategy of this regime. Somalia needs both sides (of the Middle East rivals) for its own good.""

In the past, Somali politicians have bickered over alleged interference from Kenya, Ethiopia, regional bloc IGAD or even Western countries. Shabaabs thrived during those times, but often only considered everyone as an invader, rather than appearing to take sides with foreign entities.

As 2019 winds down, employers operating in California will not want to forget that January 1, 2020, rings in several new California laws affecting the workplace. Here’s a New Year’s Eve countdown of 10 important new California employment laws taking effect in 2020 and actions employers can take before the ball falls in Times Square.

10. AB 1223—Organ Donor Leave: Assembly Bill (AB) 1223 amends California Labor Code Section 1510 to require that employers grant an employee an additional leave of absence, not exceeding 30 business days in a one-year period, for the purpose of organ donation. Currently, employers are required to provide 30 days of paid leave for organ donation. This amendment adds 30 days of unpaid time off for a total of 60 days of protected leave for organ donation. Employers are not required to maintain the employee’s health insurance coverage during the additional 30-day leave period.

What to Do Now: Employers may want to review and update their organ donor policies and leave of absence request forms.

9. AB 673—Penalties for Unpaid Wages: AB 673 amends Labor Code Section 210 to allow employees to recover penalties for equal pay violations (Labor Code Section 1197.5) and failure to timely pay wages (Labor Code Sections 201.3, 204, 204b, 204.1, 204.2, 204.11, 205, and 205.5) or to recover civil penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA)—but not both for the same violation.

What to Do Now: Consider conducting spot audits of payroll practices to ensure that employees are receiving their pay in a timely manner. Also consider conducting an equal pay audit to identify whether certain job categories are vulnerable to equal pay claims.

8. AB 25—California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA): AB 25 amends Civil Code provisions of the CCPA to exempt, until January 1, 2021, employers from all provisions of the CCPA, except for the provisions regarding private civil actions (Civil Code Section 1798.150) and the obligation to inform the consumer as to the categories of personal information to be collected from job applicants and employees (Civil Code Section 1798.100(b)).

What to Do Now: Consider having privacy notices updated to comply with the CCPA by January 1, 2020. Most importantly, companies covered by the CCPA can implement CCPA-compliant programs to protect personal data, including employment-related data, by January 1, 2020, because the right to file civil actions for data breach is effective on that date.

7. AB 749—No-Rehire Provisions: AB 749 adds Section 1002.5 to the Code of Civil Procedure. It prohibits provisions in settlement agreements that prohibit, prevent, or otherwise restrict a settling party from working for the employer or any parent company, subsidiary, division, affiliate, or contractor of the employer against which the settling party filed a lawsuit or a claim with an administrative agency, in an alternative dispute resolution forum, or through the employer’s internal complaint process. The new law does not apply to separation agreements that are negotiated prior to filing any lawsuit, claim, or internal complaint.

What to Do Now: When settling employment discrimination, retaliation, and harassment claims, employers can carefully review the settlement agreement to ensure that it does not run afoul of this provision and, where applicable, consider including exclusionary or disclaimer language in the agreement to minimize the risk that the settlement agreement will be invalidated.

6. AB 5—Independent Contractors: AB 5 amends Labor Code Section 3351 and adds Section 2750.3 to codify the ABC test for determining independent contractor status. Workers are presumed to be employees under the new law. In order to maintain independent contractor status the hiring entity must prove:

the worker is “free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact”; the worker “performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business”; and the person “is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed.”

The law contains several exemptions for certain professions, industries, and business relationships. It is important to note that even where the new ABC test is not applicable, the old multi-factor Borello test for independent contractor status must be satisfied to avoid liability for independent contractor misclassification. The Supreme Court of California is currently reviewing whether the ABC test should be applied retroactively to contractor relationships that existed prior to April 30, 2018. On December 29, 2019, two companies and two individual drivers filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles challenging AB 5 on the grounds that the statute is unconstitutional.

What to Do Now: Companies using independent contractors (especially where the contractor is a single individual) may want to audit their written independent contractor agreements to ensure that the independent contractor relationship is clearly defined. Companies can also examine the realities of the relationship; i.e., the level of control that is or can be exerted over the contractors, the services provided by the contractors, and whether the contractors have taken the appropriate steps to establish an independent business.

5. AB 51—Arbitration Agreements: AB 51 adds Section 432.6 to the Labor Code, thereby prohibiting employers from requiring that new and existing employees agree to arbitrate any claim under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) or the Labor Code as a condition of employment. The new law does not affect arbitration agreements that were executed prior to January 1, 2020. The law prohibits employers from threatening, retaliating or discriminating against, or discharging an individual for refusing to consent to the waiver of “any right, forum, or procedure” for a violation of the FEHA or the Labor Code.

AB 51 expressly exempts written arbitration agreements that are enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) regulating interstate commerce, settlement agreements, and negotiated severance agreements. Several business groups filed a lawsuit challenging the validity of AB 51 on the grounds that the state law is preempted by the FAA. On December 30, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting all enforcement of AB 51. The hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for January 10, 2020.

What to Do Now: Companies that easily meet the interstate commerce test under the FAA can implement an arbitration program or maintain their current arbitration program. Companies may want to have their arbitration agreements reviewed and updated if necessary. Companies that may not meet the test may want to evaluate whether the risks of costly challenges to an arbitration program outweigh the benefits of arbitration, or wait until the legal challenges to AB 51 have run their course.

4. SB 188—Create a Respectful and Open Workplace for Natural Hair Act (Crown Act): Senate Bill (SB) 188 amends Section 12926 of the Government Code, relating to discrimination, by defining “race” to include “traits historically associated with race, including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles.” The new law defines protective hairstyles to include braids, dreadlocks, twists, and other unspecified hairstyles associated with race.

What to Do Now: Consider reviewing and updating antidiscrimination and grooming/appearance policies in employee handbooks to ensure that they appropriately address hair textures and hairstyles associated with race. Also consider training supervisors to ensure that they do not impose improper restrictions on employee hairstyles.

3. SB 778—Harassment Training and SB 530—Construction/Temps Training: New legislation in 2018 mandated that all employers with at least five employees provide at least two hours of harassment training to all supervisors and at least one hour of harassment training to all nonsupervisory employees. The original law set a January 1, 2020, deadline for completion of the training. SB 778, which amends Section 12950.1 of the Government Code, extends the deadline to complete the training to January 1, 2021. Employers that completed the required training in 2019 do not have to retrain employees in 2020.

SB 530 requires that employers with seasonal/temporary workforces (those hired to work six months or fewer) provide harassment training to their workforce by January 1, 2021. SB 530 also imposes special harassment prevention training requirements on employers in the construction industry that employ workers pursuant to a multiemployer collective bargaining agreement.

What to Do Now: Employers may want to move quickly to develop and implement a training program for all employees to be completed before January 1, 2021. Note that section 12950.1 of the Government Code contains specific requirements for the form and content of the training, and the qualifications of the trainer. Finally, employers can implement a tickler system to ensure that supervisors and employees receive training every two years going forward.

2. AB 9—Statute of Limitations: AB 9 amends Sections 12960 and 12965 of the Government Code to increase the statute of limitations for filing discrimination, harassment, and retaliation claims under FEHA from one year to three years. The new law maintains the requirement that aggrieved employees file a complaint with the DFEH before they may file a claim in court but increases the time limit for filing a complaint to three years from the unlawful practice. The substantial increase in the length of time that employees can wait before filing a complaint may make it very difficult for employers to mount an effective defense because witnesses may no longer be available or have a clear memory of the events that form the basis for the complaint.

What to Do Now: Employers may want to review their record retention guidelines to ensure that relevant employment documents are kept for at least three years. In addition, the creation of contemporaneous documentation supporting adverse employment decisions can be critical to an employer’s ability to defend claims. Consider training supervisors and human resources professionals on best practices for documenting employment actions and decisions.

1. SB 142—Lactation Accommodation: SB 142 amends sections 1030, 1031, 1033, and 1034 of the Labor Code to require employers to provide a safe and clean lactation room and access to a sink and refrigerator in close proximity to the employee’s workspace. The new law applies to all employers; however, employers with fewer than 50 employees may seek an exemption from the requirements. Employers may not discharge, discriminate, or retaliate against an employee for exercising her rights under the law. The law deems denial of reasonable break time or adequate space to express milk a failure to provide a rest period in accordance with state law, which triggers a rest break penalty of an additional one hour of pay for each day there is a violation. Finally, employers must develop and distribute a policy about lactation accommodation that alerts employees to these rights.

What to Do Now: SB 142 imposes significant and costly obligations on employers of all sizes and in every industry, regardless of the male/female ratio of the workforce. Employers that currently have employees who are pregnant or lactating can take immediate action to comply with the new law.", Bring lawsuit against ,3

Rich Walker, the head of Shadow Robot Company, warned of catastrophic consequences for mankind if artificial intelligence is used in military conflicts. In an interview with the Daily Express, he claimed that organisations that are studying the use of autonomous weapons systems in conflicts say that using AI in these circumstances is a bad idea. ""The positives of doing it are so small compared to the huge stack of negatives, so really we shouldn’t be doing this”, Walker cited the organisations as saying.

He said that the international community should treat this technology the same way it treats other dangerous technologies that people resort to in desperate situations. “We don’t allow people to use chemical weapons in war, we don’t allow people to use biological weapons and the use of land mines and cluster mines is heavily regulated or controlled”, Walker explained.

He confessed that he is against the American model of testing weapons, which he described as “let us see what goes wrong and what we can do about this"". ""Overall with AI and warfare, we can see some of the things that could go wrong so let us stop them from ever happening if we can”, Walker said.

10503,552f1bc9e55e0e1ea3819f6c94bd9322,"SYDNEY: A major operation to reach thousands of people stranded in fire-ravaged seaside towns was under way in Australia on Wednesday after deadly bushfires ripped through popular tourist spots and rural areas leaving at least eight people dead.

Navy ships and military aircraft were deployed alongside emergency crews to provide humanitarian relief and assess the damage from the deadliest spate of blazes yet in a months-long bushfire crisis.





Police said three more bodies were discovered on Wednesday, bringing the confirmed death toll since late Monday to eight, including a volunteer firefighter killed when a “fire tornado” flipped his 10-ton truck.

There were mounting fears for several others missing after the country’s southeast was devastated by out-of-control blazes, which destroyed more than 200 homes and left some small towns in ruins.

Information was trickling out of coastal communities where thousands of holidaymakers and locals were thought to have seen in the New Year taking refuge from flames at surf clubs, as power outages and damage to telecommunications towers brought down phone lines and the internet.

New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said emergency services faced a “real challenge” trying to help injured people in isolated areas.

“We haven’t been able to get access via roads or via aircraft. It’s been… too dangerous and we simply can’t access, nor can the people in these areas get out,” he said.

Fires were raging across the country and the defense force said it could take days for the military to reach people in some remote areas.

‘Ember attacks’

There was relief in the town of Mallacoota — where towering columns of smoke turned the sky pitch black and nearby fires caused waves of “ember attacks” — after a change in the wind spared around 4,000 people who had huddled on the foreshore.

Survivors cheered firefighters who battled to protect them by creating a protective ring of fire trucks.

Authorities were preparing for the possibility that Mallacoota could be cut off for weeks: aircraft have begun dropping supplies into the town while a barge with two weeks’ worth of supplies was due to arrive later Wednesday.

Paramedics were reportedly assessing the injured and moving those requiring further treatment to a 25-bed floating medical center off the coast.

Many people have returned to find their homes burned to the ground, with the task of rebuilding shattered communities expected to take years.

Gary Hinton escaped flames roaring through Cobargo early Tuesday and returned to the stricken town to find his father’s house largely intact, but many other buildings reduced to cinders.

‘Long and dangerous fight’

Cooler temperatures and easing winds provided a window of opportunity for relief efforts Wednesday, but there were concerns over new fires sparked by lightning in alpine regions.

“There’s a lot of people holidaying, again, up in those areas,” Crisp said. “We’ll be prioritizing those [fires] and hitting them as hard as we can. We don’t need any new fires.”

Firefighters were racing to take advantage of the milder weather in the country’s southeast to contain dozens of blazes, as authorities warned the fire danger would spike on Saturday as temperatures soar again.

“At the very least, weather conditions will be at least as bad as what they were yesterday,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.

“That makes this a long and dangerous and complex fight, a long and dangerous process to support everyone who’s been impacted by it,” Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews added.

This season’s blazes have killed at least 17 people, destroyed more than 1,000 homes and scorched about 5.5 million hectares (13.5 million acres) — an area bigger than Denmark or the Netherlands.

For weeks, major Australian cities have been choked by toxic bushfire smoke, and on Wednesday air quality reached hazardous levels in Canberra as visibility in the capital plummeted.

Satellite images showed smoke from the latest fires had blown across the Tasman Sea to reach New Zealand.

The unprecedented crisis has sparked street protests calling on the government to immediately act on climate change, which scientists say is creating a longer and more intense bushfire season.

Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison has come under increasing pressure for his response, which has included holidaying in Hawaii as the disaster unfolded and reiterating his steadfast support for Australia’s lucrative — but heavily polluting — coal mining industry.", Accuse of aggression,3

Mutharika commented on the rape of the women and girls in his New Year’s message to people in the country.

He expressed hope that the truth will be known in the matter.

A report by the Malawi Human Rights Commission released last month revealed that the police raped 17 women and girls during an operation at Msundwe in Lilongwe.

Meanwhile, the Malawi Police Service (MPS) has said its inquiry team set up last year will release a report on the issue later this month.

MPS Acting Inspector General Duncan General said on Tuesday that the rape victims went to Police and their statements were recorded.

He added that the police have set up another team comprising officers from several regions of the country to conduct criminal investigations and those identified as suspects will be prosecuted.

Officers made the horror discovery after they arrested a man who attempted to flee a random breath test station on Nicholson St.

As police approached, the vehicle drove off before hitting a guard rail nearby. The driver, a 56-year-old man, was arrested at the scene.

After speaking with the man, other officers went to the Campbell St home where they found a 51-year-old woman with multiple stab wounds.

She was unable to be revived.

The street has been cordoned off as crime scene investigators collect evidence and canvass for witnesses.

“I was lying in bed reading until 11pm, but I didn’t hear anything,” one neighbour, who did not wish to be named, told the Illawarra Mercury.

“It is confronting. We live in a usually quiet townhouse complex. It is a bit of drama for New Year’s Day.”

Wollongong police Inspector Angela Burnell called the woman’s death a “tragic start to the New Year”.

“Our thoughts go out to the family,” she told reporters.

“Crime scene investigators are continuing with their inquiries. Police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.”

The arrested man had been under police guard in hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries related to the crash.

Wollongong detectives have established Strike Force Carrela to investigate the circumstances surrounding the woman’s death.

Following inquiries, the man was charged with murder.

He was refused bail to appear at Wollongong Local Court on Thursday.

Protest rallies have been common during the #MeToo era, but many of the demonstrators outside the 2019 Southern Baptist Convention were quoting scripture.

As a teaching tool, they offered a large model of a millstone. That was a reference to the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus warns that for anyone who leads ""little ones"" astray, ""it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.""

Protesters come and go. Inside the convention center in Birmingham, Alabama, Rachael Denhollander warned SBC leaders that it was past time for them to focus on the faces and stories of sexual-abuse survivors in their own pews. Abuse survivors are trying to get church leaders to stop hiding abusers and the institutions that shelter them, she said.

Far too often, ""we do this in the name of unity: 'Don't say anything negative. We need to be unified.' But brothers and sisters ... we are to be unified around the holiness of God. We are to be unified around our confrontation of sin and our confrontation of the darkness. We are to seek light.""

Headlines about sexual abuse among Southern Baptists are ""not a surprise"" to survivors, she added. ""What you need to understand is these men and women have been pleading with the church to hear their voices for decades, and they have been shut out over and over and over again in the name of Christ. That's what the SBC has done to these survivors. You need to understand the perspective that they have come from. You need to feel the grief and the betrayal and the harm and the hurt they have felt.""

Denhollander is best known as the first woman to speak out and file a police report of abuse against USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. She has also played a crucial role in the #ChurchToo firestorm surrounding the SBC after a Houston Chronicle investigation revealed hundreds of victims of abuse by clergy and volunteers in America's largest non-Catholic flock.

Members of the Religion News Association selected the SBC scandal as the top religion story of 2019. However, Denhollander was not selected as the RNA's top religion newsmaker. That honor went to Democratic U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, who were at the center of bitter 2019 debates about U.S. aid to Israel.

I voted for Denhollander as the top religion newsmaker. As my No. 1 story, I combined several poll options to focus on the year's hellish uptick in attacks on worshippers in mosques, Jewish facilities and churches, including 250 killed in terrorist attacks on Easter in Sri Lanka.

Here's the rest of this year's RNA Top 10:

2. A gunman linked to white-supremacist blasts on social media kills 51 worshipers and wounds 39 at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, creating a stunning video of his rampage.

3. A special United Methodist Church General Conference affirms the church's doctrines on marriage and sex, including a ban on same-sex marriage rites and the ordination of noncelibate LGBTQ clergy. Signs of schism increase, including a statement by Western Conference bishops offering a ""safe harbor"" for gay and trans clergy.

4. In Catholic scandal news, former cardinal Theodore McCarrick is defrocked for the abuse of boys and sexual harassment of seminarians. Buffalo (New York) Bishop Richard Malone resigns after mishandling abuse cases, and a report pins financial and sexual sins on former Wheeling-Charleston (West Virginia) Bishop Michael Bransfield.

5. The beloved Catholic shrine Notre-Dame de Paris is heavily damaged by fire, while heroic first responders, including the chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, prevent total destruction.

6. Old-guard Christian conservatives protect President Donald Trump amid impeachment hearings, while evidence grows of tensions and splits in evangelicalism.

7. A Gallup poll finds that about half of Americans have ties to a house of worship, while Pew Forum research indicates that 26% of Americans are now ""Nones.""

8. Democrats Omar and Tlaib – the first Muslim congresswomen – are denied entry to Israel, while drawing fierce online attacks from President Trump.

9. Hindu nationalists in India revoke the autonomy of majority-Muslim Kashmir, while the Supreme Court backs Hindus seeking a temple on the site of a mosque razed by mobs in 1992.

10. Gunmen kill one person at a Poway, California, synagogue; two others outside a German synagogue; and three in a Jersey City kosher market. Anti-Semitic attacks and threats increase around the world.

Maybe one of the most historic and eventful years that many of us have ever seen.

So let's get right to it. These are the stories you're going to be talking about in 2020.

The trial of President Donald J. Trump

It looks like a pretty good bet that Trump will beat the impeachment rap in the U.S. Senate. If the Dems actually send impeachment over for trial, that is.

No matter what happens, the Democrats and the mainstream media will breathlessly insist that this is the most important event in the history of the Republic, instead of the crassest political hit job ever.

Weed world

New York lawmakers still want to legalize marijuana for recreational use. And with a $6 billion budget deficit looming, they have plenty of monetary incentive to do so.

But will the health controversy around vaping stymie the drive to legalize? And how would legal weed be kept out of the hands of minors? How will police deal with stoned drivers? Who gets to decide how any weed tax revenue is spent?

A haze of questions.

Democratic slugfest

After a seemingly endless debate season, Democratic voters will finally start to cast ballots to choose their candidate against Trump.

The race for Congress

Will Island Trump voters make Rep. Max Rose suffer for his pro-impeachment vote? The Dem flipped a usually reliable GOP seat in 2018, but may have a tough time holding onto it given Trump's popularity here.

GOP Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis has backing from Washington Republicans, but has had a fractious relationship with her local colleagues. She also backed Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary, and has said she regretted voting for Trump in the general election.

Former Brooklyn prosecutor Joseph Caldarera is also seeking the GOP nod.

Police have launched a murder inquiry after a man and woman were found dead in a Midlands village on New Year's Day.

The couple's bodies were discovered in Duffield, Derbyshire, just after 4am on Wednesday, January 1.

Derbyshire Police said a man had been arrested at the scene on suspicion of two counts of murder.

Officers from Derbyshire Constabulary were called to the village at 4.11am today.

The arrested man, 39, remains in custody.

A local resident, who didn’t want to be named, said: ""I woke up this morning and had a look outside to see what the New Year was looking like.

""I was shocked to see all the tape and cones attached to my gate.

""I guess something serious happened because of the men in white suits but police won’t tell me anything.

""Everything was fine last night and we entered 2020 fine. We went to bed at around 1am and there were lots of fireworks but nothing unusual.""

A statement from the East Midlands Ambulance Service said: ""We received a call at 4.30am on 1 January from our colleagues in Derbyshire Police requesting medical assistance at a private address in Duffield.

Large sections of the road near the property have been cordoned off by police.

Duffield is a village in south Derbyshire centred on the River Derwent with a population of roughly 5,000."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
10873,cbac9aa980a6e501088ce122f3ca017f,"The US sees a direct operational link between the attack on its embassy in Iraq and Tehran, its special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said on Wednesday.

Iran-backed Iraqi militia members and supporters on Wednesday withdrew from the mission by order of their leaders, ending a 24-hour siege after the arrival overnight of more American troops.

""The attack on our embassy yesterday was orchestrated by Iran,” Mr Hook told The National.

He said the Trump administration saw a direct operational link between the attack on Tuesday and the government in Tehran.

“Iran organises, trains and equips Shiite military proxies and we do not make a distinction between the Iranian regime and Iranian militias,"" Mr Hook said.

“Any attack by an Iranian militia, the Iranian regime will be held accountable.""

Mr Hook said the decision by Iraqi militias to withdraw their supporters from the embassy’s perimeter as “a positive development”.

He said the situation was “relatively calm”, and that the US troops sent to Baghdad and Iraqi military posted at the embassy would improve security.

Mr Hook said he expected more sanctions to be imposed on Iran, whose government was “isolated, running out of money and in a state of panicked aggression”.

The attack on the embassy and the withdrawal order from the Popular Mobilisation Forces, the umbrella body of Iraqi militias mainly answering to Iran, highlighted Tehran’s reach in Iraq.

It threatened to raise tension with the US to a level where violence could be difficult to control.

“We call on all of the crowds present near the US embassy to withdraw in deference to the order by the Iraqi government and to preserve the prestige of the state,” the PMF said, according to Russia Today TV.

The Iraqi military later said: ""All protesters have withdrawn, tents dismantled and other forms of demonstrating that accompanied these protests have ended, and the Iraqi security forces have completely secured the embassy perimeter.""

Militia members and supporters remained camped outside the embassy despite tear gas and stun grenades fired at them earlier on Wednesday by Iraqi or US forces.

US President Donald Trump said earlier that Iran would be held “fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities”.

....Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019

Despite the ease with which the crowd entered Baghdad's high-security Green Zone to attack the embassy on Tuesday, their action appeared to be planned to avoid a full assault on the compound or loss of life.

That was in line with a strategy by Washington and Tehran to keep a check on any escalation between the two.

An Iraqi special forces fighter assigned to guard the Green Zone told AFP his units had no orders to intervene.

""If I had had orders to act, I could have fired and stopped the storming of the embassy,"" he said.

Some buildings outside the embassy compound were set on fire and members of the crowd, some in military fatigues, again hurled stones at the embassy on Wednesday.

The attack recalled the 1979 hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran and the 2012 attack on the US mission in the Libyan city of Benghazi.

US military released video of troops being flown in to the embassy after Defence Secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday that about 750 more soldiers would be sent immediately to Baghdad.

The embassy was attacked in retaliation to US air strikes on Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia sites in Iraq and Syria on Sunday, in which at least 25 of its members were killed and dozens more wounded.

The Pentagon said the raids were in response to a rocket attack on an American base in Kirkuk last week, in which an American contractor was killed.

It was the latest in a series of attacks on US targets in Iraq since Washington intensified sanctions on Iran in mid-2019.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday said on Twitter that he strongly condemned “the US's malice"" in the raids on the militia.

That guy has tweeted that we see Iran responsible for the events in Baghdad & we will respond to Iran. 1st: You can’t do anything. 2nd: If you were logical —which you’re not— you’d see that your crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan… have made nations hate you. https://t.co/hMGOEDwHuY — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) January 1, 2020

Kataib Hezbollah is one of the militias most loyal to Iran in the PMF.

Although the paramilitary forces are nominally integrated into the Iraqi state, some often operate under orders from Iran, the US and Iraqis say.

""Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible,"" Mr Trump said on Twitter.

A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah said its supporters intended to lay siege to the embassy until it was shut down and US diplomats left Iraq.

The US State Department said all personnel at the embassy were safe and there were no plans to evacuate the compound.

Ambassador Matthew Tueller was said to be on his way back to Baghdad from holidays but had yet to arrive on Wednesday afternoon."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
10898,3dc8cbe172592060122c12ad4c12714b,"Proving that the Left are miserable 365 days a year, flailing Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren spent the last few hours of 2019 hyping the sham impeachment and trash-talking President Trump. Warren also torched Republicans as “fawning, spineless defenders of his crimes.”

The socialist senator made the remarks during a New Year’s Eve address in Boston, where she ranted:

“In a few hours, the dawn of a new year will break over America, offering us a moment for pause and reflection. It is normally a moment for optimism, but let’s face it: This year in America has been anything but normal. “In the past 12 months, the President has become bolder with his lies and more brazen in his law-breaking. He has tried to squeeze a foreign government to advance his own political fortunes. Meanwhile, the Republicans in Congress have turned into fawning, spineless defenders of his crimes.”

The small crowd at Warren’s speech broke into applause when she blasted Republicans. Warren then disingenuously claimed that “it has brought no one any joy” that the House Democrats impeached President Trump even though that’s all they’ve bloviated about since the day he got elected.

Looking ahead, Elizabeth Warren melodramatically claimed that Americans are afraid of a second Trump term because “our democracy hangs in the balance.” She said:

“As we turn the page tomorrow into an election year, and into a new decade, there is the chill of fear in the air. People are afraid. Afraid for their families and their neighbors. Afraid for the children locked in detention centers, and the children on lockdown in our schools. Afraid for women, LGBTQ people, especially trans people, whose rights will be decided by the Supreme Court next year.” “Afraid for our country, afraid for our planet. And the danger they feel is real. Our democracy hangs in the balance.”

Warren then urged leftists to continue to resist and obstruct President Trump by wasting another year whining — just like they did for the past three years. “Fighting back is an act of patriotism,” Fauxcohontas huffed.

Despite the Democratic Party’s hollow lip service to wanting a female minority as its presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden remains the clear frontrunner in the Democratic primary race. Following close behind is socialist Bernie Sanders.

Elizabeth Warren’s poll numbers have tumbled despite the implicit backing she has received from former president Barack Obama. For months, Obama has praised Warren at private fundraisers with wealthy donors — while publicly warning his party not to veer so far-left, because that alienates mainstream America.

Meanwhile, multiple polls have President Trump beating all his Democratic contenders in general-election match-ups.

Moreover, three election prediction models project that Trump will easily win in 2020.

Trump wins 2020 in all 3 Moody models; financial analysts predict a landslide due to booming economy https://t.co/uhqM6Msmhj via @BIZPACReview — Bo Snerdley (@BoSnerdley) December 26, 2019

The Moody’s Analytics prediction model has been accurate since 1980 — missing only once in its 40-year history. That was in 2016 when it wrongly predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the electoral college.

The three prediction models show President Trump getting at least 289 electoral votes. You need a total of 270 votes to win. In one of the prediction models, Trump wins a whopping 351 electoral votes — an absolute landslide.

A YouTube personality is sharing with her hundreds of thousands of followers how her 3-month-old son is helping to save other kids' lives after the baby tragically passed away this week.

Brittani Boren Leach, of San Antonio, Texas, shares on YouTube her daily life as a mom to four boys and one stepdaughter.

On Christmas Day, the 29-year-old found her youngest son, Crew, had stopped breathing during a nap at a relative's house.

""I don’t have any words right now, other than to desperately ask for your prayers,"" Leach wrote on Instagram. ""Not the kind that you say 'I’m praying for you' and don’t, but the kind where you fall on your knees and beg God for a miracle.""

In Instagram posts over the next several days, Leach shared photos of Crew in the hospital and connected to machines monitoring his health.

Leach told ""Good Morning America"" in a statement Wednesday that doctors later determined Crew had ""sustained brain injuries that were catastrophic and irreparable. ""

""After careful thought and many prayers, we made the difficult decision to donate his healthy organs to children in need,"" Leach said in the statement. ""Our hearts are shattered, but we find solace in the hope that other children may live, because of Crew.""

""Through this experience we have learned that the list of patients in need of an organ transplant greatly exceeds donor availability,"" she wrote. ""In light of this deficit, we hope to inspire others to make the life saving decision to become an organ donor.""

""We want to thank the first responders, doctors and nurses who provided loving care to Crew in the final days and hours of his life,"" Leach added, noting the family is also ""profoundly thankful for the outpouring of love and support our family has received during the most difficult time of our lives.""

Methodist Children's Hospital, the San Antonio hospital where Crew was treated, shared a video Monday of an emotional ceremony marking the donation of Crew's organs.

Hospital employees raised a Donate Life flag on the flagpole outside the hospital as Crew's family and hospital staff watched.

""For every [organ] donor a Donate Life flag is raised in their honor for providing the ultimate gift of life,"" Methodist Children's explains in the video. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with this courageous family.""

There were more than 113,000 candidates for transplant on the U.S. national waiting list as of July, the most recent data available. Included in that number are almost 2,000 children waiting for a transplant, according to OrganDonor.gov, the U.S. government's organ donation website."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
11084,0744eeec64b8a6e0b01c9643c44ec58b,"A 61-year old woman was killed after being struck by a stray bullet while celebrating the New Year shortly after midnight.

Harris County deputies responded to a report of a gunshot victim in the 12300 block of May Laurel Drive in North Houston shortly after midnight Wednesday.

Deputies said Philippa Ashford, 61, and her family had been discharging fireworks with their neighbors in the cul de sac of their street when she suddenly cried out that she had been shot, struck by a bullet fired from an unknown location.

Ashford died at the scene shortly after EMS arrived from a single gunshot wound.

Deputies believe Ashford was struck by celebratory gunfire from outside the immediate neighborhood. Deputies canvassed the area and could not locate the source of the gunfire, finding no evidence of shooting from anywhere close to the crime scene.

“We have no indication that any family member or anybody in the cul de sac was discharging a firearm and we’ve walked the streets and canvassed up and down to see if we can find any shell casings in the neighborhood and are not finding anything,” said Sgt. Ben Beall, a spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff’s Office.

11092,e1db6037ed4939a120f5e303a821c903,"DHAKA, Jan 01, 2020 (BSS)- Information Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud today said the politics of conspiracy would not be successful in Bangladesh from now on and election is the only way for changeover of the government.

“BNP and some other parties have chosen the path of conspiracies after being failed to face Awami League, its President and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina politically,” he said.

The minister came up with the observation at a press conference to inform the achievement of the ministry in last one year and its future plans at the meeting room of his ministry at secretariat here.

Replying to a query on a comment of BNP leader Selima Rahman, Hasan said, “The countrymen and we have been listening such warn for toppling the government for the last 11 years. But, election is the only way for changeover of the government.”

He said if the people of the country don’t have support on Awami League (AL), the party will leave power. “Though they (BNP) believe in intrigues to depose the government as they did also in the past. But, my belief is that no conspiracies would be successful from now,” he added.

Replying to another query, the minister said every opposition parties are practicing their constitutional rights and expressing their opinions in the parliament and other places in the country. “We are living in a democratic society and we belief in multi-party democracy. The country is also running with this theme,” said Hasan, also joint general secretary of AL.

In his speech, the minister said Bangladesh Television (BTV), the state-owned TV channel, started airing its programmes in India from September 2 by using Bangabandhu 1, the country’s first communication satellite through DTH (Direct-To-Home) platform of Doordarshan, the state-owned TV channel of India.

He hoped that like BTV, Bangladesh Betar will also start to air its programme in India from this month.

The minister said the government will work with the broadcast journalists and workers to ensure legal protection of their jobs and other facilities. “The legal protection will be ensured if the Mass Media Employees (Services & Conditions) Act is passed,” he added.

The minister said, “I’m working relentlessly for the betterment of the journalists after taking charge of the ministry. Discipline has been established in the electronic media sector following different steps.”

He said airing Bangladeshi advertisements in foreign channels has been stopped. “Besides, the cable operators are maintaining the serial of the Bangladeshi TV channels as per their on air date. After keeping Bangladeshi channels, the cable operators are keeping the foreign channels on the list,” he added.

The minister said some television channels are airing foreign TV serials dubbed in Bangla which is not acceptable. “So, the ministry has issued an order for TV channels to take the government’s approval to broadcast the dubbed serials,” he added.

He said the two-month deadline has expired for removal of Direct to Home (DTH) devices installed illegally at households yesterday. “From now on, the operators and the users would be exposed to stern punitive actions,” he added.

Hasan said, “DTH uses are totally illegal as the government didn’t give any approval to use it.”

“We have already taken initiatives for the betterment of mass media . . . these initiatives put media in order mostly,” he said.

Besides, the minister said the government is constructing modern information complexes along with hall in 64 districts.

Newly appointed Information Secretary Kamrun Nahar and Principal Information Officer Surath Kumar Sarkar were present on the occasion."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Former captain Stephen Chapman thanks attorney Gerald Ramdeen for representing them. Chapman and his former colleagues at Inland and Offshore Contractors Ltd received their severance cheques on Tuesday. Also present was Cedros councillor Shankar Teelucksingh. Photo by ROGER JACOB - ROGER JACOB

FORTY-SIX former oil and gas workers who were retrenched in February 2019 from Inland and Offshore Company Ltd (IOCL) after the closure of Petrotrin have received more than $1.5 million in severance benefits owed to them.

The first group of about 13 workers received their cheques from attorney Gerald Ramdeen who filed claims in the High Court. Five judges were assigned to the various claims and the company admitted that it owed the workers their severance.

The remaining workers in the group are set to receive their cheques in a fortnight.

Speaking at a press conference at Ramdeen’s Cornelio Street, Port of Spain, offices on Tuesday, one of the workers, former captain Stephen Chapman, said workers did their jobs with passion.

He said the group, which included captains, sailors, and engineers were all qualified but were struggling to survive.

Cedros councillor Shankar Teelucksingh, who was present at the cheque handing over ceremony on Tuesday, said the payment of severance was a “small comfort” for the workers.

“Today we have victory. It is a start for them,” he said.

Teelucksingh also issued a warning to employers: “Do not interfere with workers.”

Ramdeen said the workers had “suffered tremendously.”

In its defence, IOCL said the unfortunate circumstance of the workers’ retrenchment was as a direct result of Petrotrin’s decision to terminate its contract with it “without any consultation or prior notice.”

IOCL said the termination of contract with Petrotrin was part of the latter’s complete re-organisation of its business and which had nothing to do with IOCL’s performance.

The company said at the termination of the contract, Petrotrin owed and still owed it substantial sums for past work done and services rendered under the contract.

“Because of the non-payment of such monies due and owing by Petrotrin, the defendant was and still is unable to pay to the claimant the amount of severance pay and vacation leave initially due and owing. During the month of August 2019, the defendant received a small part payment from Petrotrin and immediately thereafter made a part payment to the claimant,” the defence said.

IOCL said it intends to complete the payment of all monies due as soon as it received sufficient further payments from Petrotrin.

After the closure of Petrotrin, IOCL retrenched more than 100 of its workers. When the former IOCL workers filed their separate claims for payment, they were told that they will receive it within one month from the date of retrenchment.

Also representing the former workers was attorney Dayadai Harripaul."," Threaten, not specified below",3

By Aaron Humes: The regional and Belmopan Nazarene Churches are demanding formal criminal charges against Jumoke Castro for the threat of sexual assault directed against Shasta Wade, wife of Pastor Louis Wade, two weeks ago.

In a jointly letterheaded release, the church resolves to “join together with the overwhelming majority of Belizeans and social partners in demanding that appropriate criminal and disciplinary charges be brought against Mr. Castro, that there is a fair trial conducted at the highest professional standards, and a prompt and appropriate penalty is meted out to deter the scourge of violence against our women in all its forms.”

In a comment to journalists this evening, Louis Wade added, “As far as we are concerned, we are not satisfied with (Comissioner of Police Chester Williams’s) comments on not finding relevant charges. Our lawyers are saying differently and that will be ventilated in the new year.”

And he told us that no apology has been forthcoming – in Castro’s subsequent post he explicitly said he would make no such apology but did say he did not mean the original intent of the post.

11339,be8563286e4a40e0f6adac19d8a888ff,"Please Make Plans to Attend a Meeting and Show Your Support for 2A-Protected Rights!

The state’s Democratic legislature will be holding hearings on Governor “Blackface” Northam’s anti-gun budget in four locations around the state on Thursday.

We understand that this is short notice. But it would have a significant impact if many of our members could show up and make a 3-minute statement and ask questions of the legislators in attendance.

We have to speak out, because your rights are under attack by the Governor of Virginia. Consider:

Governor “Blackface” is supporting SB 16, which would ban commonly-owned firearms in more than one million Virginia households — a ban that would even outlaw sporting weapons such as the Mossberg 930 Snow Goose.

The Governor has requested $4 million and 18 law-enforcement positions to enforce his gun ban — a request that could be the preparatory steps for confiscating the guns which would be banned by SB 16.

Moreover, the Governor is requesting another $3.5 million to enforce gun control that has NOT been passed by the legislature and is NOT even current law in Virginia: universal background checks, one gun a month limitations, so-called “red flag” gun confiscation orders, and more.

We need to get as many pro-gun Virginians as possible to attend these meetings and demand to know if the Delegates and Senators plan to allocate money — as delineated in budget — to confiscate common, household firearms from Virginia citizens.

You can have up to three minutes to speak to the Delegates and Senators who will be in attendance. And because they sit on the appropriations committee, you might want to consider the following types of questions for them to consider:

1) The Governor is requesting $7.5 million to enforce a gun ban, Universal Background Checks, a one gun a month limitation, “red flag” gun confiscation orders and more. Do you support this appropriation of money even though NONE of these provisions are currently law in Virginia?

2) Given that NONE of these gun control restrictions are currently the law in Virginia, would you support a budget amendment preventing the governor from using any funds to implement these anti-rights restrictions via executive order?

3) Would you support a budget amendment that would prohibit any funds from being used to implement the provisions of any new Northam gun laws until a final judgement is received from the Supreme Court that they are constitutional?

4) Would you support or oppose a budget amendment prohibiting the governor from using the National Guard or police to implement any confiscation or registration of firearms pursuant to legislation passed by the General Assembly?

5) Would you support or oppose a budget amendment that would prohibit a locality from using any funds to implement any confiscation or registration of firearms pursuant to legislation passed by the General Assembly?

6) Would you support or oppose any budget amendment attempting to penalize Second Amendment localities by reducing funds otherwise available to those localities because of their Second Amendment Sanctuary status?

7) Would you support legislation to immediately outlaw and confiscate guns, without compensation, when the gun can currently be legally owned in Virginia and across the country? Moreover, if that provision was challenged and overturned, would it be okay with you if the costs of such a lawsuit were placed on those legislators who voted for it?

These are just a sampling of the types of questions that could be asked of legislators on Thursday.

You will notice that all the questions above have a money slant to them. Again, that’s important because these meetings are being run by the Delegates and Senators who sit on the appropriations committee.

The official announcement from the General Assembly states that the purpose of these four meetings is to “receive comments on the Governor’s proposed 2020-22 biennial state budget.”

If you wish to speak, you may “register at each hearing site no earlier than one hour prior to the start of the hearing [and] speakers are asked to limit their comments to three minutes or less.”

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups who stormed the U.S. Embassy's perimeter and hurled rocks in two days of protests withdrew on Wednesday after Washington dispatched extra troops and threatened reprisals against Tehran.

By mid-afternoon, most appeared to have obeyed a call to withdraw, issued by the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) umbrella group of mainly Shi'ite militia, which said the demonstrators' message had been heard.

Young men used palm tree branches to sweep the street in front of the embassy compound. Others packed up equipment and vans arrived to take people away. Some left to set up a protest camp in front of a nearby hotel.

Iraq's military said all protesters had left by the evening.

The protests marked a new turn in the shadow war between Washington and Tehran playing out across the Middle East.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces a re-election campaign in 2020, accused Iran of orchestrating the violence. He threatened on Tuesday to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want war.

Iran, under severe economic duress from punishing U.S. sanctions put in place by Trump, denied responsibility.

The unrest followed U.S. air raids on Sunday against Kataib Hezbollah bases in retaliation for missile attacks that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq last week.

On Tuesday, crowds chanted: 'Death to America!', lit fires, and smashed surveillance cameras. They breached an outer perimeter of the embassy but did not enter the main compound.

Pompeo wrote on Twitter he thanked the emir in the call ""for Qatar’s solidarity in the face of Iran’s malign regional influence,"" including the attack on the embassy in Baghdad.

The embassy said all public consular operations were suspended and all future appointments cancelled.

The anti-American action came after months of protests in Iraq against the government and the Iran-backed militias that support it. Many Iraqis complain their country has become a battlefield for a proxy war for influence between Washington and Tehran, and that their leaders are too beholden to outside powers.

Iraq's government has long faced frictions in its close relations with the two foes. Trump spoke to Abdul Mahdi on Tuesday and demanded Iraq protect the embassy.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday condemned the U.S. attacks. Iran summoned a Swiss envoy, who represents U.S. interests in Tehran, to complain about what it described as ""warmongering"" words from Washington.

U.S. officials said 750 extra troops would initially be based out of Kuwait and as many as 4,000 troops could be sent to the region in coming days.

More than 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq supporting local forces. The air strikes have galvanized calls inside Iraq to expel them.

Many in the crowd outside the embassy said ending Washington's presence in Iraq was their main goal.

'DEVIL'S DEN'

Despite decades of enmity between Iran and the United States, Iran-backed militias and U.S. forces found themselves on the same side during Iraq's 2014-2017 war against Islamic State fighters, with both powers helping the government recapture territory from militants who had overrun a third of Iraq.

Since then, U.S. troops have yet to leave, while the Iran-backed militias have been incorporated into the security forces.

Abdul Mahdi, who has announced plans to step down in the face of anti-government protests in which more than 450 people were killed, is backed by Iran and its allies.

The militia may have decided to pull back from the embassy to avoid making him look weak or to avert clashes with government forces.

11450,59f5ef5c5721c1b95d64816228e5593a,"Francis apologised Wednesday for the flash of anger — or self-defence — that he exhibited while greeting the faithful around the Vatican’s giant Nativity scene after a New Year’s Eve liturgy the evening before.

“Many times we lose our patience,” he said. “I do, too, and I’m sorry for yesterday’s bad example.”

In an incident captured on video and spread across the internet, Francis can be seen reaching into the crowd and seeking the hands of children. As he turns away, a woman in the crowd grabs his right hand with both of her hands and yanks the 83-year-old pope back, causing him to momentarily lose his balance. Francis, visibly upset, slaps twice at the woman’s hands to free himself, rebuking her, and then angrily turns away.

In his traditional Wednesday remarks, the pontiff ruminated on patience and how it conquers “iniquity and power.”

Pope Francis slaps the hand of a woman who grabbed him, at Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican in this still image taken from a video, December 31, 2019. Vatican Media/Handout via REUTERS

This is not the first time the world has focused on papal handshakes gone awry. In March, Francis repeatedly withdrew his hand from worshippers as they sought to kiss his ring. Video of that receiving line also circulated widely, and it became material for jokes on late-night talk shows. It was also a source of consternation for conservatives, many of whom dislike Francis and called the video disturbing evidence of the pope’s breaking with tradition and ritual.

The Vatican said at the time that the pope’s motivation for yanking his hand back was itself viral. “It was a simple question of hygiene,” said Alessandro Gisotti, who was then the Vatican’s chief spokesman.

On the papal plane later that month, a reporter jokingly withdrew his hand as Francis sought to shake it, prompting a good-humoured explanation from Francis that he had simply been looking out for people’s health.

11517,64997af734354345a69010f98dea8686,"Illinois sees first legal sales of recreational marijuana The sale of marijuana for recreational purposes is now legal in Illinois

Recreational marijuana goes on sale in Michigan The Associated Press

CHICAGO -- The sale of marijuana for recreational purposes became legal Wednesday in Illinois to the delight of pot fans — many who began lining up hours early at dispensaries.

About 500 people were outside Dispensary 33 in Chicago. Renzo Mejia made the first legal purchase in the shop shortly after 6 a.m., the earliest that Illinois' new law allowed such sales.

“To be able to have (recreational marijuana) here is just mind-boggling,” Mejia told the Chicago Sun-Times after buying an eighth of an ounce called “Motorbreath.”

Illinois already allowed medical marijuana, but it is now the 11th state to allow its use and sale for recreational purposes. The law approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker allows people 21 or older to possess of up to 30 grams (1.06 ounces) of cannabis flower and up to 5 grams (0.17 ounces) of cannabis concentrate.

Pamela Althoff, executive director of the Springfield-based Cannabis Business Association of Illinois, told The Associated Press that she spent much of Wednesday morning in Chicago and the city’s northwestern suburbs. She said wait times of up to three hours were getting shorter as the day progressed.

“It has been joyous and well-run,” she said. “People are extraordinarily courteous and civil.”

Police were on-hand at most shops mostly to control traffic.

Althoff cautioned that recreational marijuana may not be consumed in public and added that like all new products, it may be a little expensive.

“We hope that down the line it will become less expensive,” she said. “The message from the industry is not promoting or opposing, it’s the state of Illinois made it legal and we’re here to provide a safe and a quality product for those who wish to consume. We encourage our customers to be responsible.”

Mary Yazel-Muska, 65, told the Chicago Tribune that she planned to celebrate her purchase from a dispensary in suburban Mundelein with champagne and edibles at home with her boyfriend.

“I’m a responsible human being,” Yazel-Muska said. ”I own a home. I worked for a bank as a fraud investigator for 20 years. I rescue dogs. I volunteer. I take care of my 93-year-old mother. It’s not like we’re all a bunch of hippies.""

Cannabis sales could generate $250 million for Illinois by 2022, according to estimates by state officials.

Neighboring Michigan made recreational marijuana legal starting Dec. 1. Missouri voters made medical marijuana legal in 2018, but the state is still working on licensing businesses. The sale and use of weed for any reason still are illegal in Indiana and Wisconsin.

Michigan has 23 retailers licensed for adult-use recreational sales. Its single-transaction limit is the same for residents and nonresidents.

In Illinois, nearly three dozen dispensaries have been issued licenses to sell recreational marijuana.

A key part of Illinois' law is the expungement of some low-level marijuana convictions. On Tuesday, Pritzker granted more than 11,000 such pardons.

Illinois Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton bought pot edible gummies Wednesday from a Chicago dispensary, WBBM-TV reported.

“I’m here to celebrate a big day in Illinois,” Stratton said.

Pritzker’s administration said “Illinois has achieved a monumental milestone” with the launch of legalized cannabis.

It “includes communities left behind for far too long, creates good jobs and expunges thousands of records for those who have lost out on opportunities and ends prohibition,” said Toi Hutchinson, senior advisor to the governor for Cannabis Control.

But a national alliance that opposes marijuana legalization said Tuesday night that marijuana commercialization is a bad idea.

“In the end, big pot only cares about being able to peddle its addictive, highly potent products in disadvantaged communities as it takes its playbook from big tobacco,” said Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana. “This what we have seen in every single state that has gone down this road, and we have no reason to expect Illinois' experience to be any different.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3
11541,e40bf27e0bd3d924fe22f5366cd566ee,"The Trump administration quietly used loopholes built into the 2017 tax cuts to give big corporations an even bigger tax savings.

The tax cut bill passed by Republicans in 2017 overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and big corporations, according to a House Budget Committee report issued earlier this year. The law gave individuals a modest short-term tax cut while permanently slashing corporate taxes from 35 percent to 21 percent. The new law has greatly contributed to the 50 percent growth in the budget deficit since President Trump took office.

Advertisement:

But that was not enough for big corporations, which launched intense lobbying efforts to carve out even bigger breaks in the bill’s loopholes. The effort led the Treasury Department to quietly change rules to hand big companies an even bigger tax break, according to The New York Times , costing taxpayers billions in lost revenue.

“Treasury is gutting the new law,” University of Houston tax law professor Bret Wells told the Times. “It is largely the top 1 percent that will disproportionately benefit — the wealthiest people in the world.”

Republicans used budget reconciliation, a congressional process that allowed the Senate to pass the tax cuts with 51 votes instead of 60. But that process requires a bill that will contribute less than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, so Republicans decided to offset the cost of the corporate tax cut by eliminating a wide range of corporate deductions and introducing new taxes.

Advertisement:

One of the biggest new taxes was the ""base erosion and anti-abuse tax,"" or BEAT , which aimed to cut down on foreign companies with large American operations avoiding US taxes by sending their profits to countries with lower tax rates. The other was a provision on ""global intangible low-taxed income,"" or GILTI , which imposed a tax up to 10.5 percent on some offshore income.

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that these two new taxes would add $262 billion in revenue over the next decade, which the Times noted would be enough to fund the entire Treasury Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Cancer Institute for 10 years.

But the new taxes also featured many loopholes, and “almost immediately” after Trump signed the tax bill, companies launched an aggressive lobbying effort to carve out breaks for themselves in the law, the Times reported.

Advertisement:

Chip Harter, a longtime tax attorney who advised companies on how to avoid taxes — before being appointed as the Treasury official in charge of writing rules regarding the new taxes — and his team “found themselves in nonstop meetings — roughly 10 a week at time — with lobbyists” from those companies, according to the Times report. Many of the lobbyists were from the same firms that Harter had previously worked for.

Earlier this month, the department released the final version of some of the BEAT rules that allowed companies to use a “complex currency-accounting maneuver” to avoid paying the tax, according to the Times, giving the lobbyists what they had pushed for.

Advertisement:

Foreign banks like Barclays and Credit Suisse also staged an aggressive lobbying effort to carve out an exemption in the BEAT law. The lobbyists included Erika Nijenhuis, who represented the Institute of International Bankers. Harter got Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to approve new exemptions for the banks earlier this year, before the tax office announced even more exemptions. In September, Nijenhuis was appointed to a job at Treasury's Office of Tax Policy.

Officials at the Joint Committee on Taxation projected that the exemptions for international banks alone would cut revenue by up to $50 billion.

All told, BEAT is only likely to collect “a small fraction” of the $150 billion projection, tax adviser Thomas Horst told the Times.

Advertisement:

The department made the moves even as Treasury officials warned Harter that it may lack legal authority to exempt bank payments from the law. Harter dismissed the objections, according to the Times.

“We thoroughly reviewed these issues internally and are fully comfortable that we have the legal authority for the conclusions reached in these regulations,” a Treasury Department spokesperson told the Times.

Companies like Procter & Gamble, News Corp., Comcast, Liberty Mutual and Anheuser-Busch also launched an intense lobbying effort to exempt themselves from GILTI. After months of meetings with lobbyists, the department announced the rules that the companies had pushed for in June.

Advertisement:

As a result, companies “continue to shift hundreds of billions of dollars to overseas tax havens” and the IRS is collecting tens of billions less in revenue than Congress projected, the Times reported. In 2018, the United States lost more tax revenue than any other developed nation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .

But big companies may have even more tax breaks coming.

“In the coming days, the Treasury is likely to complete its last round of rules carrying out the tax cuts,"" the Times reported. “Big companies have spent this fall trying to win more.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

Ogiamien made the plea to the traders on Tuesday after Ayelala worshippers had sanctified the items and revoked the curses initially placed on those who stole the goods.

It will be recalled that Ayelala worshippers invoked curses on people who had stolen the goods during the recent fire incident in the market, which caused a scare, forcing the arsonists and thugs to return the items.

According to the market leader, “Many of the goods have been returned which include sewing machines, Plasma TVs, refrigerators, wrappers, food stuff, goats and chickens.

“We have called Ayelala worshippers to sanctify the items so that the owners can collect them.” She urged the traders to come along with proof of ownership so they could retrieve their goods.

Ogiamien also warned against stealing of the retrieved items as it would amount on imposing curse on oneself.

11621,7e3e695b09641195fd370ce351d53299,"HONG KONG: HSBC Holdings Plc condemned acts of vandalism against its property on Wednesday (Jan 1), saying it believes they are ""unjustified.” Protesters lit a fire at one branch and sought to deface iconic lion statues in front of its Hong Kong headquarters.



""We strongly condemn the acts of vandalism and damage directed at our premises repeatedly in the last few days. We believe these are unjustified,” a spokesperson for HSBC said in a statement Wednesday evening, adding that some of its ATMs and banking facilities had been suspended.



""We believe the rule of law is essential to Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center and we look forward to the speedy resolution of the issues.”



The bank has become a target in recent weeks after it closed the account of a group linked to the protests. Police last month arrested four people for suspected money laundering linked to the pro-democracy protests and froze HK$70 million ($9 million) in funds related to the Spark Alliance, a group that helps protesters pay legal fees.



HSBC defended its decision to close the account, saying it was unrelated to the December arrests and followed a ""direct instruction” from the customer in November.



Meanwhile, protesters blocked roads and set two street fires in Wan Chai even as the crowds thinned out after police halted the rally. Police said in a statement that ""rioters” had damaged the traffic lights in the vicinity of Des Voeux Road Central and Pedder Street in the central neighborhood, and built road barricades using items like traffic cones. Officers at one point deployed a water cannon.



The Hong Kong government issued a statement appealing to participants in the march to disperse soon after it ends and to avoid any illegal or violent acts.



""To safeguard the rule of law and public peace, the police will enforce the law strictly,” said the statement, attributed to a government spokesman. It mentioned that most protesters had expressed their views ""in a lawful, peaceful and rational manner.”



The government ""has all along respected people’s rights and freedoms to participate in peaceful processions and assemblies and express views rationally, as these are the important core values cherished by Hong Kong people,” the statement said.



CHRF said Hong Kong police had asked it to cease protesting and dismiss demonstrators, vice convener Figo Chan told reporters.



An earlier police statement didn’t mention the request, but said officers had used the minimum force required to deal with the incident in Wan Chai. A police spokesperson reached by phone had no immediate information.



After the request CHRF called for people to stay calm, with one organiser urging police not to threaten crowds who were walking peacefully in Wan Chai.



The police said in a statement that ""rioters” had thrown trash and petrol bombs at Luard Road and Hennessey Road, posing a ""grave threat to public safety.”



""Police are deploying the minimum necessary force, including tear gas, to effect dispersal of protesters,” it said. ""Police warn all lawbreakers to stop their unlawful acts immediately.”

BANGKOK, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Provincial Waterworks Authority (PWA) on Wednesday issued a warning to all Thais to brace for serious drought in 31 provinces starting 2020.

This year's drought will affect 61 water production facilities in 31 provinces, 15 in the northeast, nine in the north, six in the south and one in the east, said PWA in a press release.

Meanwhile the Thai Royal Irrigation Department (RID) said it will begin to dig wells to tap underground water as an alternative source.

The digging into 524 wells across drought-affected provinces will be assisted by the Armed Forces Development Command, the Royal Thai Army and the Department of Groundwater Resources.

Last December, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation declared drought in 11 provinces across Thailand.

Water trucks had been deployed to the 11 drought affected provinces to provide residents with water for consumption and farming. Enditem"," Threaten, not specified below",3

For those of you faced with arguments at work or in the pub about the death penalty, I shall now provide a Question and Answer guide to the case for hanging.

Q. Well, I would be in favour of the death penalty, but I am worried about innocent people being hanged. Doesn't that fear make it impossible to have a death penalty?

A. No. It is a perfectly good argument for taking a huge amount of trouble to ensure that innocents are not executed. It is also a good argument for bringing back some sort of property or education qualification for juries, and abolishing majority verdicts. Nobody should be hanged except on a unanimous verdict of a jury of mature and educated people. But the world isn't perfect, and we don't let this concern for the innocent stand in the way of lots of other policies, many of them supported by the very people who raise this objection to execution.

For instance, every three years, two people are killed by convicted murderers released early from prison. These victims are innocent. In that case, the liberals who advance this argument would have to accept that every convicted murderer should be locked up for life without the chance of parole so as to avoid the risk to the innocent. But they don't believe this. So where's their concern for innocent death now? Then again, most people supported the Kosovo war and still do (especially liberals). But when we bombed Serbia, we knew that innocents were bound to die, and they duly did die - including the make-up lady at the Belgrade TV station. That didn't stop these liberal leftists, who oppose hanging guilty murderers, from supporting it, and continuing to support it after those deaths had taken place. The same went for the Iraq war, and the Libya war.

Not a liberal leftist? Then there's our mad transport policy which just happens to suit quite a lot of us down to the ground, of relying so heavily on motor cars that we require an incredibly feeble driving test and allow tens of thousands of unskilled people to drive cars when they are far too young (or old) to drive responsibly. We know from experience that this will result, every year , in many hundreds of innocent deaths. Yet we do nothing.

Our failure to act, in the knowledge that this failure will lead to those deaths, is deliberate, conscious self-interested negligence, morally equivalent to deliberate proxy killing for personal advantage (as offered by Harry Lime to Holly Martins in the Big Wheel in 'The Third Man'). It is also the reason why the courts don't adequately punish those who kill while driving. We're all conscious that driving isn't really safe, that we impose far too much responsibility on drivers in a fundamentally dangerous system, and that it could so easily have been us who did the killing. Personally I think this intolerable carnage is a much more urgent problem in our society than the faint hypothetical risk of hanging someone for a murder he didn't commit. So is the growing level both of homicide itself, and of violence (see figures on 'wounding to endanger life' and attempted murder below) that would be homicidal were it not for our superb emergency surgeons, who nightly drag back dozens from the lip of the grave.

People dislike being told this truth about killing innocents and our real attitude towards it, because it is absolutely true and very harrowing (I've entirely left out the abortion question on the basis of 'one thing at a time') . These deaths are all of innocent people. If the fear of killing an innocent person really was an overwhelming veto on a public policy, then the driving test would have to be made so difficult that most of us could never pass it, speed limits would have to be lower than they are now, and seriously enforced, and private car ownership restricted to a tiny few highly-skilled persons.

The truth is that the fear of killing innocents is not a reason to abolish or ban capital punishment. If it were, we'd have to abolish the armed services and be forced to ride bicycles. It is a reason for being very careful about using it. This argumnent (often advanced by poiliticians who fear having to authorise executions personally) is an excuse for people not to face up to their responsibilities.

I'd add that the abolition of the death penalty has been followed by (I strongly suspect that the relationship is causal) the increased use of firearms by police. In the USA, where the detah penalty is a political fiction(see below) police shoot dead roughly 900 people a year. I'm not going to say theyre all innocent as no doubt many are not,m but they have certainly not undergine due process, jury trial, multiple appeals etc. Yet nobody cares.

Q. How can you express moral disapproval of killing, by killing someone else?

A. It is not killing we are trying to express loathing for. It is murder. All of us, except absolute pacifists, accept that killing is sometimes justified. In simple self-defence, the case is easy. In defensive war, in which aggressive actions are permitted, less straightforward but still acceptable to most of us. And I think quite a few of us would be ready to forgive and condone in advance an assassination of an aggressive tyrant before he could embark on war. So we license armed forces to shoot back at our attackers, or to attack our attackers in retaliation or deterrence.

What we are disapproving of is murder ( the Commandment is not, as so often said 'Thou Shalt Not Kill', but 'Thou Shalt do no Murder'). Murder, remember, is the deliberate, premeditated, merciless (and often prolonged and physically cruel in the extreme) killing of an innocent person, generally for the personal gain of the murderer. There is no comparison between such an action and the lawful, swift execution of a guilty person, after a fair trial with presumption of innocence, the possibility of appeal and of reprieve.

Absolute pacifists are at least consistent, but if they had their way we'd be in a German empire where innocent people were being executed all the time with gas-chambers, guillotines and piano-wire, and worse. So their consistency doesn't offer much of a way out.

Q. But deterrence doesn't work. Most states in the USA have the death penalty and the murder rate is often higher there than in states that don't have it.

A. First of all, this is not the USA, a country with aterrible history of slavery and racial segregation and far higher levels of violence (until recently anyway) than we have had for centuries. Comparisons between the two countries need to be made with great care. Secondly, no US state really has the death penalty. Even Texas, which comes closest, still fails to execute the great majority of its convicted murderers, who fester for decades on death row while conscience-stricken liberals drag out their appeals to the crack of doom. Texas suffered 1,322 murders in 2018. It executed 13 killers that year. Most states which formally have the penalty on their books seldom or never apply it. Louisiana, in theory a death penalty state, suffers about 500 murders a year. Its last execution was in fact in 2010.

The 1949 UK Royal Commission on Capital Punishment (which was inconclusive on deterrence and most other things) pointed out that deterrence was very hard to establish. Countries which abolish the death penalty usually do so after a long period of suspension, or when it is hardly used, or when the law is unclear. So the murder rates before and after the formal date of abolition often tell us very little. In Britain, this is also the case. The death penalty had its teeth drawn in 1957 and the annual number of executions in the final years of capital punishment was small. So the penalty's official date of abolition, 1965, is misleading. There's another feature of this I'll turn to later.

Then there is the difficulty of classifying murder. The 1957 Act introduced a category of 'manslaughter due to diminished responsibility' which got you off the death penalty. And so, for the eight years after 1957, this category of homicide grew quite sharply. Some suspect that these are cases which would have been murders before 1957. If that is so, as we shall see, then it makes quite a lot of difference. Since then, it has not been so important, since the difference between a manslaughter sentence and the so-called 'life' sentences given for murder is no longer as stark as the old distinction between a prison sentence or an appointment with Mr Albert Pierrepoint on the scaffold.

Nowadays, it is suspected (especially by the relatives of victims who write to me about this complaining) that quite a lot of cases which would once have been prosecuted as murder are now prosecuted as manslaughter so as to get a quicker, easier conviction.

So the homicide statistics offer a rather wobbly idea of what is going on. Skip this if you want, but it is important. The blurred categories might suggest one thing, while actually saying another. Even so, here are some samples.In 1956, when the death penalty was still pretty serious, there were 94 convictions for homicide in England and Wales (all future figures refer to England and Wales unless otherwise stated). Of these, 11 were for infanticide, 51 for manslaughter and 32 for murder. In 1958, after the softening of the law, there were 113 homicide convictions - 10 infanticides, 48 manslaughters, 25 for manslaughter with 'diminished responsibility' and 30 for murder. By 1964 there were 170 homicide convictions - 12 infanticides, 73 manslaughters, 41 manslaughters due to 'diminished responsibility' , 44 murders. So, in eight years, a rise in homicide from 94 to 170, quite substantial. But those convicted for murder had risen only from 32 to 44, which hardly seems significant at all. What was really going on here could only be established by getting out the trial records. But it is at least possible that, by reclassifying and downgrading certain homicides, the authorities had made things look a good deal better than they were. Remember, these are convictions, not totals of offences committed.

Sorry, more statistics here. In 1966, immediately after formal abolition, there were 254 homicide convictions, 72 of them for murder. In 1975, 377 homicide convictions, 107 for murder. In 1985, 441 manslaughter convictions, 173 for murder. In 2004, there were 648 homicide convictions - including 361 murders, 265 ordinary manslaughters and 22 'diminished responsibilities'. Interestingly, more people were convicted of manslaughter (265) than were charged with it (137) and none of those convicted of 'diminished responsibility' (22) were charged with it . Many murder prosecutions failed (759 were proceeded against).

The increasingly important charge of 'attempted murder' has also run into trouble. In 2004 417 were proceeded against, and 96 convicted. Prosecutions for wounding or other acts endangering life was even more troublesome, with 7,054 proceeded against and 1,897 convicted. These figures, again, are for charges and convictions rather than instances of the offence, which in both cases is considerably higher. Offences of wounding etc are now close to the 19,000 mark each year, around triple the total for 30 years ago. AS the Indepndnet on Sunday reporte don 27th April 1997 : 'Britain's murder rate would be at least treble what it is now but for improvements in medicine and the growing skills of surgeons and paramedics, medical and legal experts believe.



Many people who are now charged with attempted murder or wounding would, several years ago, have been facing a murder charge, as their victims' lives would not have been saved.



Latest crime figures for the past 20 years show that while the murder rate has increased slightly, from 616 to 745, attempted murder cases have shot up from 155 to 634, and woundings to endanger life have doubled from 5,885 to 10,445.



""The murder rate is artificially low now,"" said Professor Bernard Knight, the leading Home Office pathologist who has been involved in a number of high profile cases, including the Fred West murders in Gloucester.



""People say there were far more murders in the old days, but the woundings that happen now would have been murders then. If you look at the rise in murder rate it is very small, but look at the wounding figures and the graph goes up 45 degrees. If that number of woundings had occurred years ago the murder rate would have been massive."" Medical improvements are thought to have had the biggest impact for victims of stabbings and shootings and there are a number of cases of people surviving being knifed through the heart. '



This is the point - many of these cases would have been murders, if we still had the medical techniques of 1965. Again, this makes direct 'before ' and 'after' comparisons, required for a conclusive case for or against deterrence. hard. And we must also remember the general moral decline that has accompanied the weakening of the law, and may have been encouraged by it. Not to mention the huge increase in marijuan use (associated with violent crime and mental illness) which has also taken place in this period. If you remove the keystone of an arch, many other stones, often quite far away in the structure, will loosen or fall.

Finally, a little historical curiosity which I personally find fascinating. Some American researchers suggest that the sort of murder which has increased since the death penalty in the USA was effectively abolished in the 1970s is so-called 'stranger' murder, for example, the killing of a woman by her rapist , or of a petrol station attendant by the man who has robbed him. The calculation ( and criminals do calculate) is simple. ""If I leave this person alive, she or he can testify against me, and I could go to jail for a very long time. If I kill him or her, then there will be no witness and I will probably get away with it entirely. And even if I am convicted of murder, all that will happen is jail time."" Bang.

So, the death penalty may actually prevent or deter violent crimes which might otherwise end in an opportunist killing. It is said that British bank-robbers, before 1957, would search each other for weapons in case one of them killed, and they all swung - which was then the rule. And Colin Greenwood, a former police officer and expert on Gun Crime, produces the following interesting , in fact gripping fact. In both 1948 and 1956, the death penalty was suspended in this country while Parliament debated its future. During both periods of suspension, armed and violent offences rose sharply. After the 1948 attempt to abolish hanging failed ( Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin being among the Labour MPs who voted to keep it), they fell sharply. After 1956, when the law was weakened, they fell back again, but not so sharply. In 1964, they rose again, and have been doing so ever since.

I think this, taken together, is strong evidence for a deterrent effect. I am not talking about total deterrence - some crimes could never be deterred - but partial and significant, potentially lifesaving. How many innocents have died, or been horribly maimed, because those who accept the salaries and perks of office are not prepared to assume its hard duties, and wield the civil sword?And yet opponents of the death penalty whimper on about the minuscule danger of hanging the wrong person.

Q. Surely revenge has no part in a civilised society?

A.How true, and how right. One of the purposes of stern penalties is to prevent revenge by making it clear that the law has real teeth. But a toothless law will lead to the return of revenge among us. The bargain we strike with our rulers is that we give up the right to personal vengeance, and the endless blood-feuds that follow it. And in return, we ask our rulers to wield a stern law, dealing with wrongdoing in such a way as to drive home the moral lesson that no evil deed goes unpunished. It's a simple contract.

Civilised, law-governed societies rest on it, but our political class prefer not to fulfil it because they haven't the moral guts to take responsibility for sending a murderer to his death. It is this gutlessness among politicians, more than anything else, that has led to the abolition of the death penalty. They won't take the responsibility. This cannot be said often enough. The result is that responsibility is increasingly handed over to an unofficially armed police force, which shoots people without trial, appeal or the possibility of reprieve, and often gets it wrong. Watch the numbers grow.

But that's only the beginning. If (as I fear) respect for the criminal justice system continues to dwindle especially among the abandoned honest poor, we can expect to see an increase of vigilante private 'justice', even lynch-mobs. What the left-liberals don't seem to grasp is that if they strangle justice, revenge is what they will get. And then, rather too late, they will be able to tell the difference between the two. I wish there was some other way to explain it to them.", Accuse of aggression,3

11797,e3eef13a3b9be54138120a19de8a3a34,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Coal-fired utilities around New Delhi were still operating on Wednesday despite threats from the Indian authorities to close them down if they had not installed equipment to cut emissions of sulfur oxides by the end of the year.

Three senior executives at companies operating power plants around New Delhi and facing an end-2019 deadline said they had not received direction on whether they could continue to run the plants having not installed the kit.

Only one out of the 11 utilities in the national capital region had installed the equipment.

India had already extended its December 2017 deadline for its utilities to meet the emissions standards - posing a further challenge to the authorities grappling with the pollution that can cause lung disease and blights air quality.

Officials from the India’s Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), who had threatened a shut down for non-compliance, did not respond to repeated calls and text messages seeking comment.

Reuters reported last month that more than half of India’s coal-fired power plants and 94% of the coal-fired units ordered to retrofit equipment to curb air pollution would likely miss the phased deadlines.

The air quality index for the Indian capital, the worst affected major city, indicated “severe” conditions on Wednesday - like most days this winter - a potential risk for even healthy people.

Real-time data government data showed both power plants in the country’s largest state of Uttar Pradesh which had a Dec. 31 deadline were operating. In Punjab, Vedanta-owned TSPL units were producing power, as were state-run plants at Ropar and Bhatinda.

Mohammed Shayin, managing director at northern Haryana state-run power generator HPGCL said all units other than ones under scheduled maintenance were operational, adding that the utility was “pleading” with federal authorities to extend the emissions deadline.

Private producers such as Vedanta and Larsen & Toubro Ltd argued for yet another extension to the deadline.

L&T-owned Nabha Power Ltd said it was “constrained to shut down both its units due to a delay in extension of timelines by the CPCB”.

Vedanta said it was “confident” that authorities “would take a considerate stand”.

“We shall shut the plant in case we get the directions from the CPCB or the environment ministry,” the company said."," Threaten, not specified below",3
11835,99a649ee7522bbcf76632b7494094832,"Dubai, 1st January, 2020 (WAM) -- The UAE Nation Brand hit a record of 10.6 million votes from 185 countries as the campaign drew to a close to announce the logo that will represent the UAE and lead the country’s inspiring story towards the next 50 years.

Voters have contributed to planting 10 million trees to empower communities in areas affected by climate change in Nepal and Indonesia as the UAE had promised to plant a tree for every vote as part of the campaign.

The tree plantations will contribute to safeguarding biodiversity, combating climate change, protecting the environment and empowering vulnerable communities affected by climate change. The initiative reflects the UAE’s values of giving and reinforces the country’s role as a beacon of hope in the world.

The UAE will focus on planting millions of mangroves and tropical forests to promote food security and empower families in Numfoor Island, one of the most disadvantaged areas of Indonesia where subsistence farmers and fishers make up approximately 75 per cent of the population. West Papua, Indonesia, situated in the Coral Triangle, is an area recognised as the global centre of marine biodiversity and a global priority for conservation because of the broad range of species it supports, including at least 500 species of reef-building corals.

In Nepal, the UAE will plant millions of mangroves at the Amaltaari planting site in Nawalparasi, home to endangered species including leopards and the elusive Bengal tiger. The tree plantations are expected to empower thousands of local people, mostly farmers, and improve their lives.

The project will encourage the local people to positively contribute to protecting the biodiversity of the Asian country that hosts more than 700 species of wildlife that enrich the country’s nature elements.

People across the globe cast their votes on one of three UAE logos displayed on the UAE Nation Brand official website. The 49 Emirati artists contributed to designing ""Emirates in Calligraphy"", ""The Palm"" and ""7 Lines"".

His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, had invited people across the globe to take part in voting for the new logo to represent the UAE. The unique call to global audiences reinforces the humanitarian and global aspect that distinguishes the UAE and reflect its deeply-rooted values of openness, coexistence and tolerance.

Participations in the UAE topped the list with the 15 per cent of the total votes for the Nation Brand logo, followed by India, US, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Australia, Canada, Algeria and the UK.

500 million views The voting campaign attracted an overwhelming 500 million social media views, reflecting the widespread admiration of millions of online users who actively took part in the humanitarian initiative to help combat climate change and empower communities.

In an initiative that turned the national project into a global humanitarian initiative, the UAE pledged to plant a tree for every vote to the logo that will represent its story to the world.

The ""Emirates in Calligraphy"" logo emphasises the unique association and sentiment that the name ""Emirates"" brings to UAE citizens, residents and visitors coming together from all over the world.

The logo depicts the aesthetics of Arabic calligraphy that reflects authenticity and originality associated with the UAE. The rolling curves of the font capture the flow of ocean waves merging with the sand dunes of UAE’s golden desert, portraying the country’s unique geographical identity.

The smooth and harmonious movement of the letters symbolises the constant human and social progress in the UAE as a nation that does not stop growing in the face of challenges and does not believe in the word ""impossible."" The UAE is a country built on achieving the impossible.

The palm tree has long been associated with the Emirates, forming an indispensable part of its history and distinctive identity as an unconditional giver.

By designing the palm tree with colours closer to golden, the logo manifests the undulating vistas of the desert dunes shining in the sunlight. The elegant lines suggest the radiance, momentum and dynamism of a nation on the move.

Symbolising the willpower of the leaders and people of UAE, palm trees have withstood storms and challenges with strength and firmness. Their powerful branches are as high as the ambitions of the people of UAE, with leaves providing shade and support to millions of people living on the land.

Similar to Canada’s maple leaf and New Zealand’s silver fern, the palm represents the national identity of the UAE and sums up the country’s values of giving, pride, dynamism and ambitions.

Seven lines rise up tall with momentum, optimism and dynamism as a tribute to the seven bold leaders who shaped the Emirates and united their people’s aspirations under one flag. Seven lines, shaping the map of the Emirates with the national colors, represent the future-focused leaders of the seven emirates united towards the country’s growth.

The lines, vibrant in color, reflect the UAE’s ongoing journey of development driven by a wave of progress, innovation, excellence and boundless aspirations. Designed in the flag colors of black, green and red, the lines are connected with the white color, symbolising the heart and spirit uniting people of the seven emirates under the main principles of humanity. The unique diversity that enriches the fabric of the UAE society and sets it apart as global hub for entrepreneurship and innovation is featured in the different colors and sizes of the lines.

The UAE Nation Brand aims to create a symbol that distinguishes the UAE globally and presents its achievements and humanitarian values with the world. The new logo will share the UAE’s exceptional and inspiring success story of development with the world and reinforce the country’s global contribution to build a better future for humanity."," Threaten, not specified below",3

11871,f99933a95e6496be627428688f3d3d27,"The Motley Fool Canada » Cannabis Stocks » Why Hexo’s (TSX:HEXO) Stock Offering Is Bad News for Cannabis Stocks

Amid a low-volume trading week in which the markets where only open for three days, Hexo (TSX:HEXO)(NYSE:HEXO) announced an equity offering. On the surface, there is nothing wrong with equity offerings. High-growth companies do it all the time, as they need cash to fund growth. Depending on the size of the company, they may also be limited in their borrowing capacity, and as such, issuing stock may be the most effective way to raise cash. Furthermore, there is also nothing wrong with an offering at a discount to market price — it happens frequently.

What stands out about Hexo’s offering is the timing and the sheer size of the discount. For starters, it is not best business practice to announce good news at time when most investors are on holiday break. In fact, it is the perfect time to announce bad news, as there are fewer eyes to notice. It is not unlike releasing bad news after the markets close on a Friday.

Unfortunately for Hexo shareholders, there was no hiding last week’s bad news. The $25 million offering caught investors by surprise, and at US$1.67 per share, it represented a 15% discount to the company’s last closing price. Ouch. The market did not react well and sent its share price tumbling, as it closed the week at $2.10 per share — a 52-week low. It hasn’t closed at such a low price since 2017.

It is the last bit of bad news before the year is out and a fitting end to what has been a tough year for the industry. Fraught with negative headlines — illegal operations, questionable acquisitions, changes in leadership, and missed estimates — the cannabis industry has been decimated. No, I am not overreacting. As of writing, the Canadian Marijuana Index is down 55% this year, and for its part, Hexo has lost 60% of its value in 2019.

Why the offering is a bad sign

With respect to the offering, the big discount to market price is a concerning sign. It wasn’t that long ago when institutional investors were lining up to offer cannabis stocks access to much-needed capital to expand. Given the strong demand, pot stocks often received favourable terms, which helped spur significant production capacity.

The problem now, however, is that demand for recreational marijuana hasn’t been as pronounced as expected. As such, there is now excess capacity, and production growth will come at a greater cost. A 15% discount to market price, which was already significantly depressed from yearly highs, is a sign that the days of easy money are firmly in the rear-view mirror.

Think about all the acquisitions at ridiculous multiples over the past couple of years. We could see a year in which write-offs take centre stage, as cannabis companies re-evaluate their assets.

Likewise, the equity offering may be the first of many to come. It appears banks are no longer chomping at the bit to lend these producers money. At least not at favourable rates, which is most likely why Hexo tapped into the direct equity offering market. Make no mistake; despite big revenue growth, they are burning through cash and are not yet profitable. They will need additional capital to expand.

Given this, it doesn’t look as though the bleeding is over. Since the start of the cannabis craze, I have warned investors that the industry is speculative at best. Although I have no doubt there will be some strong investments in the space, over the short term, it is still a gamble."," Threaten, not specified below",3
11912,730e12f7d2b3e69d3780ca9714c06167,"Bones discovered in an Idaho cave in 1979 and 1991 have been identified as the remains of Joseph Henry Loveless, a man who escaped from prison more than a century ago after being arrested for killing his wife.

The identification, confirmed by the Clark County Sheriff’s Office Tuesday, was initially made by non-profit volunteer organization DNA Doe Project, which said in a Facebook post that the “remains were preserved in the Buffalo Cave for as long as 63 years.”

Loveless likely died around 1916 at age 46, the organization said. He appears to have been killed and dismembered.

Before his death, Loveless had been arrested at least twice for bootlegging and escaped custody by sawing through jail bars, the organization said.

Around that time Clark County Sheriff Bart May said Loveless killed his wife with an ax and was incarcerated in what was then Freemont County. He escaped again, this time using a saw he hid in his shoe, the organization said. He was never seen again.

“Back in 1916, it was the wild West up here and most likely the locals took care of the problem,” May said. “We’ll probably never solve the homicide, but we still encourage anyone who has heard stories to contact our office, you never know what piece of information could help.”

DNA Doe Project had to overcome numerous hurdles before making a positive identification. Loveless used multiple aliases, had no close living relatives in the national database, and was an off-the-grid outlaw who lacked official records.

The volunteers sifted through more than 31,730 individuals trying to find a connection to the man’s DNA.

The Discoveries

The process of identifying Loveless’s bones has been 40 years in the making.

In August 1979, a male torso wrapped in a burlap sack was discovered by a family in a cave near Dubois.

“Wearing dark colored pants, white shirt with blue pin stripes, and maroon sweater, the torso was buried in a shallow, 18-inch-deep grave,” DNA Doe Project said in a statement.

About 12 years later, a mummified hand was found, along with an arm and two legs wrapped in burlap in the same cave system. Volunteer staff and students from Idaho State University continued to comb through the cave but never found any other remains, including the body’s head, the organization said.

University anthropology professors and students worked with the organization’s volunteers to eventually come up with a tentative identification, which was sent to the sheriff’s office in November 2019.

A Remaining Relative

May said his office tracked down an 87-year-old grandson of Loveless who lived in California and agreed to meet with deputies and give a DNA sample.

Those results were analyzed by the organization and found to be 100 percent consistent with a grandparents/grandchild relationship, he said.

“The grandson had heard stories about their grandma and their grandpa,” the sheriff said. But the family stories about Loveless’s death didn’t match up with what the organization found through original records and newspaper articles, the organization said.

Loveless’s death remains an open case.

“We know he was murdered, but we don’t know who murdered him,” May said.

Emmerdale 's Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins) was horrified as she went into labour with her first child as she left the pub last night.

Emmerdale spoilers have revealed that Victoria will have her baby tonight, and will be relieved to find that she adores it straight away.

But viewers were left worried last night as they realised that Wendy was spying on Victoria just as Victoria's waters broke.

Fans know that Wendy has been harassing Victoria for months, moving to the village and insisting that Lee didn't rape Victoria and she would be a part of her grandson's life.

As they watched Wendy spy on the mum-to-be and then insist that she would take Victoria to the hospital, they took to social media to predict Wendy's plan.

One fan wrote: ""Wendy's going to get the baby, isn't she?""

Another added: "" I bet Wendy will kidnap Victoria's baby, when he is born she will be off with him.""

A third chipped in: ""So does this mean that since Wendy came to Eve's rescue, then Vic's rescue, then Liv's rescue, everyone will finally put their guard down and she'll be able to steal Vic's baby? Because at this point, that twist would be worth all this BS.""

A fourth wrote: ""Wendy is gonna come to the rescue. Again.""

Is Wendy going to steal her grandson as Victoria recovers from giving birth?

Meanwhile, the news of Victoria giving birth spreads round the Dingles as Chas tells the rest of the family what has happened.

However, Aaron can only think of a year stretching ahead without Robert and doesn't know whether he wants to see the baby.

Is Aaron going to change his mind and meet his sister-in-law's baby?

Baltimore police arrested a 16-year-old girl Tuesday who, they said made a threat of violence against Mergenthaler Vocational-Technical High School, known as Mervo to locals, on social media.

Police report Wednesday the girl confessed to investigators of making the threat against the school.





Through an anonymous profile with a picture of a gun and the Instagram name of ""Shoot Mervo up Thursday,"" the user stated a plan to shoot every student that's ""in my way,"" and had the goal to kill 200 people, according to officials.

The user claimed to be an upset parent of a bullied student, but police said it was actually a 16-year-old student of the school.

Officials were initially made aware of the threat Tuesday morning and arrested the teen less than 24 hours later.

Police said the girl will be charged as a juvenile with a threat of mass violence in the incident.

Though the girl was arrested, there will be an increased police presence at Mervo Thursday, according to police.

""Yesterday, Baltimore City Public Schools was made aware of a potential threat on social media to the Mergenthaler Vocational-Technical High School. All matters of safety and security are taken extremely seriously. The Baltimore Police Department is investigating, and City Schools will work closely with law enforcement to hold accountable those persons responsible. As a precautionary measure, additional security is present at the school on January 2, and we will continue to assess security needs moving forward,"" Baltimore City Public School officials said in a statement.

12048,2758bddd7ebc330e571fccba7c5dd459,"The US sees a direct operational link between the attack on its embassy in Iraq and Tehran, its special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said on Wednesday.

Iran-backed Iraqi militia members and supporters on Wednesday withdrew from the mission by order of their leaders, ending a 24-hour siege after the arrival overnight of more American troops.

""The attack on our embassy yesterday was orchestrated by Iran,” Mr Hook told The National.

He said the Trump administration saw a direct operational link between the attack on Tuesday and the government in Tehran.

“Iran organises, trains and equips Shiite military proxies and we do not make a distinction between the Iranian regime and Iranian militias,"" Mr Hook said.

“Any attack by an Iranian militia, the Iranian regime will be held accountable.""

Mr Hook said the decision by Iraqi militias to withdraw their supporters from the embassy’s perimeter as “a positive development”.

He said the situation was “relatively calm”, and that the US troops sent to Baghdad and Iraqi military posted at the embassy would improve security.

Mr Hook said he expected more sanctions to be imposed on Iran, whose government was “isolated, running out of money and in a state of panicked aggression”.

The attack on the embassy and the withdrawal order from the Popular Mobilisation Forces, the umbrella body of Iraqi militias mainly answering to Iran, highlighted Tehran’s reach in Iraq.

It threatened to raise tension with the US to a level where violence could be difficult to control.

“We call on all of the crowds present near the US embassy to withdraw in deference to the order by the Iraqi government and to preserve the prestige of the state,” the PMF said, according to Russia Today TV.

The Iraqi military later said: ""All protesters have withdrawn, tents dismantled and other forms of demonstrating that accompanied these protests have ended, and the Iraqi security forces have completely secured the embassy perimeter.""

Militia members and supporters remained camped outside the embassy despite tear gas and stun grenades fired at them earlier on Wednesday by Iraqi or US forces.

US President Donald Trump said earlier that Iran would be held “fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities”.

....Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019

Despite the ease with which the crowd entered Baghdad's high-security Green Zone to attack the embassy on Tuesday, their action appeared to be planned to avoid a full assault on the compound or loss of life.

That was in line with a strategy by Washington and Tehran to keep a check on any escalation between the two.

An Iraqi special forces fighter assigned to guard the Green Zone told AFP his units had no orders to intervene.

""If I had had orders to act, I could have fired and stopped the storming of the embassy,"" he said.

Some buildings outside the embassy compound were set on fire and members of the crowd, some in military fatigues, again hurled stones at the embassy on Wednesday.

The attack recalled the 1979 hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran and the 2012 attack on the US mission in the Libyan city of Benghazi.

US military released video of troops being flown in to the embassy after Defence Secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday that about 750 more soldiers would be sent immediately to Baghdad.

The embassy was attacked in retaliation to US air strikes on Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia sites in Iraq and Syria on Sunday, in which at least 25 of its members were killed and dozens more wounded.

The Pentagon said the raids were in response to a rocket attack on an American base in Kirkuk last week, in which an American contractor was killed.

It was the latest in a series of attacks on US targets in Iraq since Washington intensified sanctions on Iran in mid-2019.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday said on Twitter that he strongly condemned “the US's malice"" in the raids on the militia.

That guy has tweeted that we see Iran responsible for the events in Baghdad & we will respond to Iran. 1st: You can’t do anything. 2nd: If you were logical —which you’re not— you’d see that your crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan… have made nations hate you. https://t.co/hMGOEDwHuY — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) January 1, 2020

Kataib Hezbollah is one of the militias most loyal to Iran in the PMF.

Although the paramilitary forces are nominally integrated into the Iraqi state, some often operate under orders from Iran, the US and Iraqis say.

""Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible,"" Mr Trump said on Twitter.

A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah said its supporters intended to lay siege to the embassy until it was shut down and US diplomats left Iraq.

The US State Department said all personnel at the embassy were safe and there were no plans to evacuate the compound.

Ambassador Matthew Tueller was said to be on his way back to Baghdad from holidays but had yet to arrive on Wednesday afternoon.", Accuse of aggression,3

Gregory Goodsell, 31, was arrested Sunday after he crashed his pickup truck into an SUV at Church and Union streets in Pembroke just before 7 a.m., according to a police report filed in Plymouth District Court. Witnesses told police that Goodsell was speeding and ran a red light when he hit the SUV, which had two 13-year-old girls and a 50-year-old woman inside.

All three were initially taken to South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, and the two girls were then taken to Children’s Hospital in Boston, where one of them died.

Authorities have not publicly named the victims, but family friends have said Claire Zisserson died as a result of the crash and Kendall Zemotel suffered serious injuries. Claire Zisserson’s mother, Elizabeth Zisserson, 50, was seriously injured in the crash.

Officers said Goodsell told them that he drank beer and whisky and used cocaine at a company Christmas party before getting behind the wheel of the truck, which had a decal for the company that Goodsell allegedly worked for, Hi-Way Safety Systems, which is headquartered in Rockland. Police said they found a half-empty bottle of whisky and an empty beer can in the truck.

Goodsell was arraigned Monday in Plymouth District Court on charges that included manslaughter, drunken driving and two counts of causing serious injury while recklessly and drunkenly driving. He is being held without bail pending a dangerousness hearing Friday to determine whether he poses a threat to the public.

The state Registry of Motor Vehicles on Monday deemed Goodsell an immediate threat and suspended his driver's license indefinitely.

Goodsell's driving record, provided Tuesday by the agency, shows 13 prior violations and two surchargeable accidents where he was considered at fault dating back to 2006. Violations on Goodsell's record include speeding, failing to stop for police, failing to keep to the right of the road in areas with an obstructed view and a federal motor carrier safety violation.

Goodsell was considered to be at fault in two crashes, in January 2007 and November 2008.

Goodsell also has a dozen sanctions on his driving record, including three license suspensions. His license was suspended from February 2010 to February 2011 for having seven surchargeable events on his record and failing to make payments to the registry. His license was also suspended from January to March 2009 and July to September 2007.

In 2007, Goodsell was required to take a National Safety Council course, which the Registry of Motor Vehicles requires for drivers who have three or more surchargeable events in two years."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
12178,6a38051dbe8ec6602cf0587fd8ff44ce,"On Monday, a Florida corporation, GEO Group, filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging AB 32, a new law that would take effect today banning new private prison contracts.

The lawsuit, represented by multiple firms on behalf of GEO Group, Inc., against Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Xavier Becerra alleges that the “unlawful effect of AB-32 is to undermine and eliminate the congressionally funded and approved enforcement of federal criminal and immigration law by (ICE)…

“AB32 will impact at least ten of the privately managed facilities totaling 10,925 beds, which represent the overwhelming majority of detention capacity held by the federal government in the state of California,” the lawsuit said.

In a statement, the governor’s office said on Monday, “As our office has previously stated, for-profit prisons, including ICE-contracted facilities, run contrary to our values and have no place in California… Gov. Newsom signed AB32 earlier this year to phase them out.”

Under AB 32, authored by Alameda Assemblymember Rob Bonta, the state will begin phasing out the use of private prisons – barring the state from keeping overflow inmates in privately-run facilities beginning in 2029.

Currently, according to an October LA Times article, the state houses “about 1,600 inmates in three prisons in Kern and San Bernardino counties, run by the Florida-based GEO Group. Under the new law, California cannot renew those contracts, which expire in 2023, or enter into new ones after this year unless it needs them to keep the prison population under a court-ordered cap.”

“We’re saying, ‘No more,’” Assemblymember Bonta said at a press conference in October. “No more inhumane treatment of individuals in for-profit, private facilities. No more profiteering on the backs of Californians.”

On Tuesday, Assemblymember Bonta tweeted, “Exactly what you’d expect (from) a collapsing industry in its final death throes—a desperate attempt 2 buy another year of survival 2 pad its corporate profits, despite a nation’s rejection 4 profiteering on the backs of humans/treating people as commodities.”

A GEO spokesperson said in a statement that it’s unconstitutional for a state to regulate the actions of the federal government or its contractors.

“To be clear, we play no role in passing immigration laws and we have never taken a position on immigration policies, whether it be the length of stay at immigration processing centers or the outcome of immigration proceedings,” the spokesperson said. “As a service provider to the government, our only mission is to deliver top-rated services to those entrusted to our care as they go through their immigration proceedings.”

This is new ground, as AB 32 made California became the first in the nation to ban the operation of privately-run immigrant detention centers.

It is the federal immigrant detention centers portion of the bill that this suit attacks, however.

There have been complaints in general about private prisons, but the use of private immigrant detention centers have ignited huge controversy in recent months – as they hold hundreds of thousands of immigrants who crossed illegally into the United States or are awaiting deportation. These facilities have been criticized for poor and inhumane conditions.

But it is here that the law in California is most vulnerable. While some figured that the US would simply move such immigrants to other states, but GEO Group, Inc., through their attorneys, is arguing that this law is a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution.

The suit alleges, “Like the State of Maryland two hundred years ago, the State of California seeks to subvert these principles, asserting the authority to regulate and undermine the United States Government in the exercise of sovereign powers undoubtedly within the supreme sphere of federal action.”

They write that “it is the duty of the federal courts to guard our constitutional order against this attack.”

They add, “There is no question that the Federal Government has the power to detain individuals in anticipation of, or as a consequence of, federal criminal or immigration proceedings. Nor is there any question that the Federal Government has the authority to contract with private entities with expertise in the operation of detention facilities to carry out its detention responsibilities.”

The problem is that under AB 32 “it will be illegal as of January 1, 2020, for the Federal Government to enter into or renew such contracts for facilities in the State of California.”

They assert: “This transparent attempt by the State to shut down the Federal Government’s detention efforts within California’s borders is a direct assault on the supremacy of federal law, and it cannot stand.”

According to the AG’s office, they have not received this suit and thus have not responded.

A student has bravely told how she was raped by a vile predator after police believe she had her drink spiked at a New Year's Eve party.

Melody Maxwell, 19, was brutally raped by monster Obi Forgive while she was out partying with friends.

She has no memory of the sickening assault, but police officers later told her that her drink may have been spiked.

The last thing she remembers from the night in question is taking a swig of prosecco during the midnight countdown at a pub in her hometown of Northampton.

Melody was back from the University of Manchester when the assault happened on New Year's Eve 2018.

(Image: HotSpot Media)

The genetics student has waived her right to anonymity to speak out about the crime.

She said: ""We headed to a pub in a taxi and I texted mum to let her know where we were going. She replied telling me to stay safe.

""Minutes later, I was drinking vodka and coke while singing along to Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You.""

Melody said that as the midnight countdown came, ""my friends passed around a bottle of prosecco and I took a swig of it.

(Image: HotSpot Media)

""That's the last thing I remember.""

She woke up five hours later in her mum's car with a blanket around her shoulders.

Her underwear had been pulled down and she had no recollection of the night.

She went on: ""I was panicked. Mum revealed that the police had found me stumbling around and shouting for help, and they called her.""

(Image: HotSpot Media)

At the police station, Melody handed in her underwear and a sparkly silver dress she had bought for the night as evidence.

The next morning, a detective called Melody and suggested she took a forensic text.

At first, she refused, as she wanted to put the night behind her.

But when she found a huge bruise on her thigh and her groin was sore, she called the detective back and went to Northampton General Hospital for blood tests.

(Image: HotSpot Media)

""That day, officers confirmed that I'd been sexually assaulted and that my drink might have been spiked,"" she said.

""They had also found my phone and bag, and were investigating.""

CCTV footage showed 28-year-old Obi Forgive leaving the pub with Melody and leading her to a grassy area behind the pub.

About an hour later, he returned alone.

(Image: HotSpot Media)

Police released a photo of Forgive, and a week later he was arrested after one of the pub's bouncers recognised the rapist.

In June 2019, he appeared at Northampton Crown Court, and despite denying his crimes, he was later found guilty of rape and jailed for 11 years.

Investigators told the court that Forgive had searched for drunk women that night, and that Melody had likely been attacked for 50 minutes.

He tried to conceal evidence by changing his clothes before returning to nearby clubs to hunt for more victims.

(Image: Police handout)

The judge ordered him to serve a further five years on license and he was placed on the sex offenders' register for life.

Melody said that after her horrifying experience, she will never celebrate New Year's Eve again.

Immediate past governor of Ekiti state, Ayodele Fayose has on Wednesday, warned those who are angry over his enjoyment status, to desist from further condemning his actions.

He said that anyone who is angry with him for enjoying himself should go and hug any available transformer.

Fayose who reacted via his twitter handle against criticisms from some Nigerians that he lied to a court that he was sick and needed to be admitted in a United State hospital, opined that he went for a medical checkup and not on admission.

Recall that a federal high court had on December 7, granted him permission to travel abroad for medical treatment.

Fayose was spotted dancing with a white lady in a party in US. He was equally seen relaxing in a beach.

Irked with his actions, some Nigerians took to various social media platforms to condemn his conduct.

But in what can be said to be a riposte, Fayose averred, “These “hailers”, when I was on their case, they were crying. Now I’m on my own lane enjoying my life, they are still crying & sucking.

Expect more so you can cry more. I’m on medical checkup not admission. Celebrating New Year is my right, haters can hug transformer.

""I want to tell the Maharashtra Chief Minister that the Karnataka government will not tolerate any trouble to Kannadigas in Maharashtra,"" he told reporters here.

His statement comes in the backdrop of Shiv Sena workers reportedly hitting the streets in Kolhapur on Sunday and burning effigies of Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and stopping screening of Kannada films there.

The activists had also blackened billboards, having Kannada text, of some shopkeepers in Gandhinagar area.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had in December last year appointed ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as co-coordinators to oversee his government's efforts to expedite the case relating to the boundary dispute with Karnataka.

The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, which has been fighting for the merger of 800 odd villages with Maharashtra, had recently submitted a memorandum of their demands to Uddhav Thackeray.

Maharashtra claims the border district of Belagavi was part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, but is currently a district of Karnataka, on linguistic grounds.

Savadi, who hails from Belagavi, said the Maharashtra Chief Minister would do well to recall what his cousin Raj Thackeray had said in the past on the matter.

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray had said in October 2014 in Mumbai politicians from the state have never been serious about finding a solution to the dispute and the issue has always been used for

The MNS chief had recalled that when MEK members had met him a few years ago, he had said he was prepared, if required, to meet the then Karnataka chief minister to discuss the issue and demand that there should not be injustice on Marathi speaking people living in Belgaum and nearby areas.

On December 30, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had accused Uddhav Thackeray of raking up the Belagavi issue again for political gains and declared that 'not even an inch of land' would be given away.

A 61-year old woman was killed after being struck by a stray bullet while celebrating the New Year shortly after midnight.

Harris County deputies responded to a report of a gunshot victim in the 12300 block of May Laurel Drive in North Houston shortly after midnight Wednesday.

Deputies said Philippa Ashford, 61, and her family had been discharging fireworks with their neighbors in the cul de sac of their street when she suddenly cried out that she had been shot, struck by a bullet fired from an unknown location.

Ashford died at the scene shortly after EMS arrived from a single gunshot wound.

Deputies believe Ashford was struck by celebratory gunfire from outside the immediate neighborhood. Deputies canvassed the area and could not locate the source of the gunfire, finding no evidence of shooting from anywhere close to the crime scene.

“We have no indication that any family member or anybody in the cul de sac was discharging a firearm and we’ve walked the streets and canvassed up and down to see if we can find any shell casings in the neighborhood and are not finding anything,” said Sgt. Ben Beall, a spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff’s Office.

Ashford worked as a nurse manager for the Comprehensive Psychiatric Assessment Service at the Menninger Clinic, a mental health facility in southwest Houston. Known as ""Phil,"" Ashford was board certified in psychiatric nursing, with an expertise in motivational interviewing, mentalization-based therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and community integration.

In 2015, Ashford was presented with the Texas Nurses Association District 9 Top 25 Outstanding Nurses Award. She was also an adjunct professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and a member of the Sigma Theta Tau Nursing Honor Society and the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority.

Houston police and Harris County deputies issued public alerts on New Year’s Eve warning the public not to discharge their weapons while celebrating.

Students from various colleges and universities across India came together on Wednesday and pledged to fight the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

The CAA aims to fast-track citizenship for non-Muslim refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The NRC is meant to identify illegal immigrants and the NPR is a population enumeration exercise conducted simultaneously with the 2021 census.

At Delhi’s India Gate, hundreds of protesters shouted slogans against the CAA and read out a pledge that said they will not furnish any papers to prove their citizenship.

“Our new year resolution is to defend the constitution. They cannot keep doing whatever they want to, there have to be some norms followed and the basic structure of the country cannot be demolished,” said Sarthak Chaubey, a Jamia Millia Islamia student.

In Hyderabad, about 250 students belonging to five different universities took a similar pledge.“We shall not show any document with regard to our place of birth or religion and citizenship details,” All India Students’ Association (AISA) secretary Faizan Sarwar said. Osmania University professor Gali Vinod Kumar made the students read out the preamble of the Constitution.

In Bhopal, students from several institutions in the city and activists assembled under the banner of a Joint Action Committee against NRC, CAA and NPR and took a pledge to agitate against the central government’s steps.

Ainul Yaqeen, an executive member of the Committee said, “Students from several institutions took part in the protest. Several organisations too extended their support to us. The CAA and NRC are not in sync with the spirit of the Constitution.”

Another group of students assembled to support the CAA. “We welcomed the humanitarian act passed by the government…It is congruent with our ancient Indic values of giving shelter to helpless people,” said third-year B Tech student Prashant Rao Gokhle."," Threaten, not specified below",3

US President Donald Trump threatened to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want to go to war Demonstrations began after US air strikes targeting an Iran-backed group killed at least 25 people

""All protesters have withdrawn, tents dismantled and other forms of demonstrating that accompanied these protests have ended, and the Iraqi security forces have completely secured the embassy perimeter,"" The Iraqi military said in a statement on Wednesday (local time).

The demonstrators, angered over US air strikes against the Tehran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group that killed at least 25 people, threw stones at the building while US forces stationed on the rooftops fired tear gas to disperse them on Wednesday (local time).

But by mid-afternoon, most appeared to have obeyed a call to withdraw issued by the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) umbrella group of mainly Shiite militia, which said the demonstrators' message had been heard.

Protests were first prompted over air raids launched by the United States earlier this week. ( Reuters: Khalid al-Mousily )

Young men used palm tree branches to sweep the street in front of the embassy compound, while others packed up equipment and used vans to take people away.

US President Donald Trump — who faces re-election in 2020 — threatened on Tuesday to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want war.

The unrest followed US air raids on Sunday against Kataib Hezbollah bases in retaliation for missile attacks last week that killed a US contractor in northern Iraq.

US sends extra troops

On Tuesday, crowds chanted ""death to America!"", lit fires and smashed surveillance cameras.

They breached an outer perimeter of the embassy but did not enter the main compound.

The huge embassy, built on the banks of the Tigris River in central Baghdad's fortified ""green zone"", used during American occupation following the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, is the biggest US diplomatic mission in the world.



Washington said its diplomats were safe and that it was rushing hundreds of extra troops to the region.

US officials said 750 extra troops would initially be based out of Kuwait and as many as 4,000 troops could be sent to the region in coming days.

The embassy said all public consular operations were suspended and all future appointments cancelled.

During the two-day protests, crowds chanted ""death to America"", setting fires, threw rocks and smashed surveillance cameras. ( Reuters: Thaier al-Sudani )

The anti-American action comes after months of protests in Iraq against the Government and the Iran-backed militias that support it.

Many Iraqis have complained their country has become a battlefield for a proxy war for influence between Washington and Tehran, and that their leaders are too beholden to outside powers.

Iraq's Government has long faced frictions in its close relations with the two foes. Mr Trump spoke to Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi on Tuesday and demanded that Iraq protect the embassy.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday condemned the US attacks.

Iran summoned a Swiss envoy, who represents US interests in Tehran, to complain about what it described as ""warmongering"" words from Washington.

Mr Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the violence.

'Devil's den'

Overnight, demonstrators had pitched tents and camped outside the embassy walls, then brought food, cooking equipment and mattresses during the morning, indicating plans to stay before the withdrawal call.

""Our sit-in is eternal, until this devil's den is closed off forever, but don't give anyone an excuse to make your protest violent. Don't clash with security,"" one protest leader told the crowd.

Young men, some in fatigues, waved militia flags and chanted ""death to America"" as Apache helicopters circled above.

The embassy's outer walls bore scorch marks and graffiti.

Despite decades of enmity between Iran and the US, Iran-backed militias and US forces found themselves on the same side during Iraq's 2014-2017 war against Islamic State fighters, with both powers helping the government recapture territory from militants who had overrun a third of Iraq.

Since then, US troops have yet to leave, while the Iran-backed militias have been incorporated into the security forces.

Mr Adel Abdul-Mahdi, who has announced plans to step down in the face of anti-Government protests in which more than 450 people were killed, is backed by Iran and its allies.

The militia may have decided to pull back from the embassy to avoid making him look weak or to avert clashes with Government forces.

An actress who appeared in “Captain America: The First Avenger” stabbed her mother to death inside a Kansas home, police said.

Mollie Maxine Fitzgerald, who played “Stark Girl” in the 2011 Marvel Studios movie, was arrested Tuesday on a second-degree murder charge by police in Olathe, where her mother, 68-year-old Patricia “Tee” Fitzgerald, was found dead inside a home on Dec. 20, the Kansas City Star reports.

Patricia Fitzgerald, of Montgomery, Texas, was pronounced dead at the residence from an apparent stab wound, police announced Tuesday.

“A 38-year-old white female, known to the victim, was contacted on scene and transported to a local hospital with minor injuries,” police said. “This case remains under investigation by the Olathe Police Department.”

Additional details about the alleged killing were not provided and a police spokesman did not immediately return a message seeking comment Wednesday.

The elder Fitzgerald was in the process of moving back to the Kansas City area after living for several decades outside of Houston, her brother Gary Hunziker told the Kansas City Star. He was unable to provide additional details surrounding his sister’s death.

“We were shocked,” Hunziker said. “It doesn’t matter the circumstances – the loss of a sister is what it’s all about.”

An IMDb profile for Mollie Fitzgerald identifies her as a movie director, producer and actress who also appeared in a 2018 film called “Trouble Is My Business” and “The Lawful Truth” in 2014.

Fitzgerald is set to be arraigned on Thursday, KMBC reports."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

China's central bank is cutting the amount of cash that all banks must hold as reserves, releasing around 800 billion yuan (HK$894 billion) in liquidity to shore up the slowing economy, but analysts are downplaying its impact on boosting the stock markets and economy.

The People's Bank of China announced on its website it will cut banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, effective Monday.

The move will bring the level for big banks down to 12.5 percent. Many had expected such a move as Premier Li Keqiang said authorities were considering measures to lower financing costs for smaller companies in a speech in late last month.

""It came as little surprise,"" said BoCom International Holdings' chief strategist Hong Hao.

Hong told The Standard he expects the Hong Kong stock market to increase slightly after the cut, as it is within expectation and the 800 billion yuan unleashed looks ""meaningless"" compared to the liquidity gap of 3 trillion yuan before the Spring Festival.

""The RRR cuts have limited impact on the GDP growth,"" Hong said.

""The central bank has been cutting RRR but economic growth keeps falling.""

The PBOC has now cut the ratio eight times since early 2018 as growth slows to the weakest pace in nearly 30 years.

China plans to set a lower growth target of around 6 percent this year, relying on increased state infrastructure spending, policy sources said.

""We expect that there will be another two or three [ratio] cuts this year,"" Shao Yu, chief economist of Orient Securities, told The Standard. ""We think the loan prime rates are likely to fall this month.""

Earlier yesterday, the PBOC stressed it will keep monetary policy flexible and work to make credit cheaper for businesses.

While recent data has shown improvement and the trade war has been de-escalating, analysts are unsure if either will prove sustainable and forecast growth will cool further this year.

Freeing up more liquidity now would also reduce the risks of a credit crunch ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays later this month when demand for cash surges. Record debt defaults and problems at some smaller banks have already added to strains on China's financial system.

Of the latest funds released, small and medium banks would receive roughly 120 billion yuan, the central bank said, stressing that it should be used to fund small, local businesses.

AB 5, California’s hastily passed and controversial independent contractor statute, which codifies the use of an “ABC test,” is set to go into effect on January 1, 2020.

Already, the California Trucking Association has filed suit challenging the statute.

As have freelance writers and photographers.

Now, it’s ride-share and delivery companies’ turn to file suit.

Those companies have already commenced the process to create a ballot initiative that would allow voters to decide whether to exempt ride-share and delivery drivers from the “ABC test.”

Now, on December 30, 2019 – just two days before AB 5 goes into effect – two of those companies (and two drivers) have filed suit in Los Angeles in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, seeking to enjoin AB 5 as it pertains to them.

In the complaint, they argue that AB 5 is an “irrational and unconstitutional statute designed to target and stifle workers and companies in the on-demand economy.” They contend that the statute violates various provisions of the California Constitution, including the equal protection clause, the inalienable rights clause, and the due process clause.

The equal protection argument is particularly fascinating as the companies contend that “[t]here is no rhyme or reason to the[] nonsensical exemptions” that were granted at the eleventh hour to some industries and professions.", Bring lawsuit against ,3

Taskforce Takeback has doubled in sized and become the Rapid Action Squad to further scrutinise bikies who have fled the tough new laws. All but two clubhouses have closed on the Coast, but police are under no illusions that the bikies are gone for good.

RAP commander, Superintendent Jim Keogh, said the Black Uhlans and Lone Wolfs had maintained their clubhouses, waiting for a final decision from the High Court on the tough VLAD legislation.

“They are lurking,” Supt Keogh said. “We watch where they go, where they drink and who they talk to. Before the legislation, these guys were 10-foot tall and bulletproof. They were involved in standover in Surfers Paradise and Broadbeach and their tentacles spread to the towing and tattoo industries. We have worked hard to smash those links wherever we can.”

Supt Keogh warned if the legislation was successfully challenged, the gangs would be “back in a heartbeat”. In the meantime, police are making sure the bikies feel the pressure of intense police scrutiny.

Goal: Thank the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy for advocating for endangered species and defeating a damaging logging project in the process.

Over 2,400 acres of land in the Monongahela National Forest have been rescued thanks to one organization’s tireless fight against such destruction and for the protection of endangered species. The Big Rock Project was intended to clear land and increase timber sales. However, the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and the Center for Biological Diversity fought against the project due to its threat against the candy darter. Nearly a decade later, their fight has been won.

They advocated for the fish species to be added to the endangered species list in 2010. However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service failed to respond to their recommendations. The species is only found in the rivers and streams of West Virginia and Virginia. Only 5 of its populations are considered “thriving.” When the species was finally added to the endangered species list, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service protected over 370 miles of stream to ensure the species’ survival.

The Big Rock Project falls into this protected stream area. Thanks to the early action of the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, the land-clearing project has been brought to an end and the candy darter has been protected. Thank the organization for their work.

PETITION LETTER:

Dear President Thomas,

Ten years ago, your organization fought for the protection of the candy darter. Despite a decade of silence, politics, and development projects like the Big Rock Project, you did not give up. Now, the candy darter is listed as an endangered species, over 370 miles of streams are protected, and the Big Rock Project has been cancelled, saving over 2,400 acres of land.

Thank you for your efforts and for not giving up. Your actions have protected not only an endangered species, but the future of a national forest.

Sincerely,

As of Jan. 1, 2020, Washington drivers will no longer take an emissions test to renew their registration.

The emissions program is ending based on a plan passed in the state Legislature in 2005. The Washington Department of Ecology had projected that Washington's air quality would improve enough by 2020 to end the program, which started in 1982.

Five counties currently require emissions testing: Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Spokane Counties.

Last year, approximately 750,000 vehicles required testing. That number is down from 1.2 million a few years prior.

“When we began the emission check program back in 1982, air pollution from carbon monoxide and ozone was a serious concern in many of our biggest cities,” said Kathy Taylor, the manager of the Air Quality program for the Washington Department of Ecology. “Today, new cars are much, much cleaner than in decades past, which means we can continue to improve our state’s air quality without these regular tests.”

Officials stress this verdict will not hinder Washington’s fight against climate change, which focused on carbon monoxide emissions.

Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses that face a greater threat to the environment were not tested.

Vehicles remain the largest source of carbon pollution in Washington. Supporting zero-emission vehicles through Washington’s clean car standards and advocating for public transit are among ways state officials have been addressing the ongoing problem of pollution.

Ending the program will affect about 180 people who work for Applus, the contractor that operates testing stations. About a dozen employees at the Department of Ecology and several independent testing and repair stations will be impacted by the program's end.

Administrators have been working with the employees to prepare for the shutdown and help them find other positions.

The Jonas Brothers started things off with “Cool,” the pop single from their fifth album “Happiness Begins.” “Is it me, or am I havin’ a good year?” they sang. “Lately, I’ve been feeling so cool (cool)/Top to the bottom, just cool (cool).”

Indeed, 2019 was a good year for the trio of 20somethings who spent their teenage years as phenoms on the Disney Channel. After branching off into semi-separate careers—with Nick acting, Joe headlining the dance band DNCE and Kevin starring on the E! reality series “Married to Jonas” with his wife Dani—they reunited in August to tour sold-out arenas with their first album together in six years. And over the summer, Kevin was officially the last Jonas to go off the market, with dual wedding ceremonies in Las Vegas and France to “Game of Thrones” actress Sophie Turner. (Nick wed actress Priyanka Chopra in December 2018, while Kevin tied the knot in 2009.)

Their fandom was strong at the Fontainebleau, which drew thousands of 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds sipping champagne and vodka cocktails in sparkling gowns and tuxedos. A “family section” had those who weren’t old enough to consume alcohol cornered off much farther from the stage. At least they could buy the memorabilia: Jonas pins, sweaters and T-shirts, which sold out in all sizes except for extra-large.

As the clock was about to strike midnight, Nick addressed the crowd: “The perfect way to ring in the New Year, with a couple thousand of Miami’s best,” he said. “Now, if it’s alright with you, we’re going to bring people up who are very meaningful to us.” And with that, their three spouses—Priyanka, Sophie and Dani—all took the stage, for a public New Year’s kiss with their husbands. “I love you,” Priyanka mouthed to Nick, as she waved to the fans, in a plum-colored dress carrying a champagne flute.

And with 2020 officially underway, the Jonas Brothers went back to crooning until almost 1 a.m. Nick rallied the crowd, warning them that two of their next songs—“Sucker” and “Only Human”–would be televised on “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve.” After that, came Nick’s single 2014 single “Jealous,” with Kevin joining him on the lyrics (“’Cause you’re too sexy beautiful/And everybody want a taste, that’s why (that’s why)/I still get jealous”). They closed out the night with another rendition of “Sucker.” Vocally, they sounded as strong as they’ve been, hitting crisp notes. And they seemed to rejoice at the feat that they’re still rocking on into a new decade."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The Assembly member was then charged with making an unsafe turn and driving while intoxicated with a blood-alcohol content level of more than .08 percent, Henderson said.There were no injuries and Henderson described the damage to the vehicle as ""minor.""The DWI charge was filed as a misdemeanor because Kolb had not had any prior drunken driving convictions within the past 10 years, Henderson explained.Kolb was processed at the Ontario County Jail and released, a practice that Henderson said was standard procedure.""The way Mr. Kolb was treated would be like anyone else that was charged with this type of offense,"" Henderson said. ""I take great pride in this office and the deputies that work for me and there was no implications of any improprieties in regards to any favors.

An important decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in August defended the ability of Illinois citizens to protect their biometric data. Meanwhile, a flurry of efforts by technology giants to weaken the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) failed in the state legislature.

Amazon's Ring doorbell appliance is making it easy for police departments across the country to obtain warrantless access to the front-door footage of millions of Americans. (In fact, we’re so upset about Ring that it gets it’s very own 2019 year-in-review post.)

Facebook's follies in mishandling user data continued unabated this year with a number of disturbing dark patterns, and both Facebook and Google had their Apple Enterprise Certificates revoked when they were found to be using these certs to spy on iOS users.

Finally, EFF improved its Privacy Badger extension to protect against more forms of surreptitious tracking.

Patel v. Facebook and the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act

The Illinois Biometric Privacy Act of 2008 (BIPA) is a foundational piece of legislation that provides important privacy safeguards for ordinary people against corporations that want to harvest or monetize their biometric information. Among other guarantees, BIPA requires the informed opt-in consent of users before a service is permitted to gather biometric information. BIPA also requires a company to destroy a person’s biometric information when its purpose for collection is satisfied, or within three years of the company’s last contact with the person, whichever is sooner. Importantly, BIPA provides a strong enforcement tool to protect these requirements: a ""private right of action,"" meaning a person may file their own lawsuit against a company that violates their privacy rights.

In 2015, Illinois residents filed Patel v. Facebook, which is a class-action lawsuit alleging that Facebook violated both of these requirements with it's ""Tag Suggestions"" feature. This feature, introduced in 2010, uses a facial recognition system which suggests a tag for friends who appear in photos you upload. Facebook challenged the suit and over the next few years the case made it all the way up to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, the federal appellate court where Facebook is headquartered. In August the Ninth Circuit held that the Patel plaintiffs had constitutional standing to sue Facebook for violating their statutory privacy rights under BIPA. The court also backed its decision with forceful language explaining the grave privacy threats posed by Facebook’s face surveillance. The Patel ruling marks a watershed victory in privacy law, and we hope will act as a template for stronger biometric privacy protections in the future. EFF has worked against efforts to weaken BIPA in the Illinois Legislature, and has filed amicus briefs in support of robust interpretation of BIPA, including in the Patel case.

Technology Giants Fail to Weaken The California Consumer Privacy Act

In 2018, we worked hard to pass the The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which enshrines basic rights for California consumers to have control over—and be informed about the sale of—their personal data. This year, we fought hard to defend and strengthen it.

In March, we submitted comments to the California Attorney General with suggestions on how to implement the CCPA, including using the ""do not track"" (DNT) header sent by browsers as a mechanism to opt-out of data sharing and using secure verification methods before informing users of the data that's been gathered about them. In April, we supported efforts to advance two bills to strengthen the CCPA, including requiring consumer's opt-in consent to share data, disallowing ""pay-for-privacy"" schemes that put a premium on protection of user data, and allowing individuals to bring their own privacy claims to court. Unfortunately, these efforts were met with significant opposition from technology industry trade association groups and stalled in the legislature.

In contrast, the big technology companies backed a number of bills that each would have weakened the CCPA’s protections, spending nearly $176,000 on the effort. Taken together, they would have effectively neutralized this groundbreaking privacy law. Fortunately, the efforts of our supporters and coalition partners paid off, and after sailing through the Assembly, the bills were stopped in July by the Senate Judiciary Committee. On January 1, 2020, the CCPA will take effect without having been undermined by the very companies it is meant to protect consumers from.

Still, it must be strengthened in order for those protections to be effective. In October, EFF joined a coalition of a dozen organizations in a new set of comments to the California Attorney General. These reiterated the recognition of DNT as an opt-out mechanism and requested a clarification that bans efforts of the adtech industry to evade the opt-out requirement. The California Attorney General is required to adopt regulations by July 2020 to further the law’s purposes, we hope our suggestions in these comments will be adopted.

Facebook's Follies

This year has not been a good one for Facebook, and it has only itself to blame. Facebook’s 2019 has been marked by collecting copious amounts of user data without their consent and mismanaging that data. In the first month of 2019, Facebook was found to have been paying people to give up their privacy by installing an application that spies on them, doing this by having them install a root security certificate on their iOS device. This violation of Apple's Enterprise Developer program prompted Apple to revoke the application and briefly Facebook's Enterprise Certificate, causing some panic within the company.

In February, we demanded that Facebook stop using users phone numbers provided for the purposes of 2FA instead for advertising. In March, they continued their streak of privacy violations by allowing anyone to find your account via your phone number, by default. The company was found in March to essentially be running a phishing attempt to gather the email username and passwords of its own users, ostensibly to verify users' email addresses. In our investigation of the attempt, we found that they were using this information to import and link users to their e-mail contacts without ever asking for user consent.

Also in March, Facebook announced a “pivot to privacy” that would include implementing end-to-end encryption in all three of its messaging properties. We were glad to see the company embracing privacy fundamentals, but we’ll believe it when we see it.

The FTC reached a settlement with the company this year over violations of a 2012 settlement order concerning the company's deceptive statements about user privacy through its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which violated the privacy rights of millions of Facebook users. We found the terms of the settlement completely unsatisfactory in limiting the privacy-invasive behavior of Facebook, and the monetary damages are not sufficient to dissuade them from the same behavior in the future.

Given Facebook's dismal track record this year, we expect more of the same with their newest forays into cryptocurrency and a dating service.

Google's Gaffes

Google's year didn't look much better. It was also found in violation of Apple's Enterprise Developer program under the aegis of ""user research"" with their Google Screenwise application and had their certificates revoked in the same way. And much like Facebook, Google's Screenwise was siphoning off massive amounts of user data in exchange for a monetary payback - this time a $20 gift certificate. It's no understatement to call Screenwise a comprehensive spying app, capable of seeing anything on your screen—your application usage, the websites you visit—and even using an always-on microphone to determine what you're watching.

The New York Times reported earlier this year on a little-known technique using location data collected by Google to let law enforcement know about devices in a specific location at a certain time. If you've allowed Google to store your location, you could be opening yourself up to so-called ""reverse location"" searches used by the FBI and police in at least 7 states across the country.

Lastly, in an August statement Google doubled down on the targeted advertising techniques it is so heavily involved in. As the number one tracker across the web, Google proposed its Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), which essentially furthers the identification and categorization of users into categories useful not to their own browsing, but to advertisers. Introduced as a way to replace traditional tracking methods such as fingerprinting, FLoC replaces it with a formalized system, developed by Google, for tracking users into consumer profiles based on their browsing habits.

EFF’s Technology Projects

We've made strides in protecting users’ privacy through efforts to encrypt DNS requests with DNS over HTTPS. Your ISP can currently see which websites you visit through your DNS requests, which can be read as unsecured packets on the wire. This year we've redoubled our efforts to close this security hole and ensure everyone can use the Internet without fear of prying eyes.

We've also improved our browser extension Privacy Badger to detect and block a new class of evasive, pervasive third-party trackers, including Google Analytics. Install it now.

What's In Store for 2020?

In 2020, we'll be working on legislative efforts to improve consumer privacy protections and ensure that any new federal legislation does not weaken state protections.

We'll also be fighting hard for data portability, the ability to pick up and leave a service you don't like with your data and ""port"" it to another service. And going one step further, we'll also be pushing for adversarial interoperability, which envisions a world where the tools we use to communicate with each other, the data those tools use, and the ways that they are allowed to use them take place in a way that we are able to control.

Safari tourists bragging on social media about rare sightings of endangered animals in the Kruger National Park are unwittingly leading poachers to the rhinos and elephants that are under threat.

A rise in selfies and online boasting has also led to animals being killed on the South African reserve’s roads as visitors speed to grab the best videos and photographs “to gain views and following”, Ike Phaahla, a park spokesman, said.

13362,d7860dcb9060ace4891adf2d6556e2f7,"At 5 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 31, Washington’s vehicle emissions check program will end, marking the close of 38 years of emissions testing on cars and trucks in major metropolitan areas.

When state licensing offices reopen Jan. 2, emissions tests will no longer be required in order to renew vehicle registrations. Car owners who are scheduled to have their emissions tested in 2019 still need to get a final test in order to renew their tabs this month, according to a state Department of Ecology news release.

Testing was required in most of Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish and Spokane counties.

“When we began the emission check program back in 1982, air pollution from carbon monoxide and ozone was a serious concern in many of our biggest cities,” said Kathy Taylor, manager of the Air Quality program for the state Department of Ecology, which oversees the emission check program. “Today, new cars are much, much cleaner than in decades past, which means we can continue to improve our state’s air quality without these regular tests.”

Washington’s Legislature set the wheels in motion to end the testing program back in 2005, when it adopted more stringent emissions standards for new cars and trucks. Those standards took effect in 2008, and vehicles 2009 and newer were exempted from the testing requirement. Vehicles older than 25 years are also exempt, which has meant a shrinking pool of cars are still subject to the requirement – total annual tests have declined from a peak of about 1.3 million to roughly 750,000 in 2018.

Even without a testing requirement, it remains illegal in Washington to drive a vehicle with modified emissions controls, and drivers can be ticketed if their vehicle smokes or poses a threat to public health.

The end of the testing program will have little effect on Washington’s efforts to fight climate change. The testing program was always aimed at toxic forms of air pollution like carbon monoxide, rather than the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are the primary drivers of climate change.

Closing the program will affect about 180 people statewide that work for Applus, a contractor that operates the testing stations for the state, and a dozen employees at Ecology, plus several independent testing stations and certified repair facilities. Applus and Ecology have been working with their staff members to help them prepare for the shutdown, and find other positions when possible.

“We want to thank our staff and our partners for their efforts,” Taylor said, “but most of all, we want to thank Washington drivers for doing their part to maintain their cars and protect the air we all breathe.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

The Wall Street Journal has a look at White House counsel and Ukraine cover-up accessory Pat Cipollone’s efforts to steer Donald Trump through the speediest and rigged-est Senate impeachment trial that can be managed. As usual, the most noteworthy parts are the hints that, no matter what Cipollone wants, he is constrained by what he can get the great orange buffoon to agree to. And the great orange buffoon wants a clown show.

Cipollone’s status as head of the White House impeachment defense seems secure, according to the Journal, but the Oval Office Hate Pumpkin wants lawyers on his team with more “television experience.” “Under consideration are Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers, and Alan Dershowitz,” reports the Journal, while noting that Dershowitz currently is fighting an Epstein-related rape allegation. (Other White Houses would almost certainly avoid such a figure; Trump, accused of rape himself, of course has no such inhibitions.)

Also still being contemplated as part of the Senate impeachment defense team: Trump’s “staunchest defenders” among the House Republicans that humiliated themselves during the House Judiciary and Intelligence committee impeachment hearings. We can take that to mean, no doubt, crime-auctioneer Doug Collins, the ever-coatless Jim Jordan, and whoever else yelled the loudest. It is less likely to include Rep. Devin Nunes, who did not disclose during those impeachment hearings that he had direct involvement in the Ukraine schemes himself, via the now-indicted Lev Parnas. Nunes has been keeping a considerably lower profile since that tidbit was outed, and probably does not want to be anywhere near Senate questioners right now.

So, the short version: clown show. Donald Trump wants a clown show. He wants it to be staffed by people he has seen on his television set, because those are the only people he trusts, and White House counsel Cipollone may or may not have enough clout to talk him out of it. Senate Republicans do not want a clown show, because the longer a trial drags on, the more tenuous their claims of not knowing or understanding the evidence against Trump, including that provided by numerous witnesses, become. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is still unabashedly assuring the public that the fix is in and the trial, if there is one, will be dispensed with in short order; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is still putting a hold on transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate in an effort to pressure McConnell into at least pretending to not be as corkscrew-crooked as he is.

The longer Pelosi holds up the Senate trial, the more irate Trump is likely to get. The more irate Trump gets, the more likely it is he will lose his temper with Cipollone, as he has with seemingly every single other White House official who has ever tried to stop him from doing Stupid Things, and instead put some shouting television idiot in charge.

And that’s assuming no new evidence comes out in the next few weeks that highlights, yet again, how brazenly illegal the White House understood Trump’s Ukraine orders to be. The odds of no such evidence popping up? Near zero.", Sexually assault,3

As of Wednesday, authorities confirmed that seven have died -- six in New South Wales and one in Victoria -- and one person remains missing in south-east Australia as a fire rages its way toward the coastline.

Among the dead were two people found in their separate cars, and a father and son who had stayed within the fire zone to defend their property. A fireman died after his engine was flipped by cyclonic winds.

Mick Robertson, who had been reported as missing on Monday, was confirmed to have been found dead near his home in Buchan Tuesday via family members.

""Very sad day for us to (start) the year but we're a bloody tight family and we will never forget our mate and my beautiful Uncle Mick,"" posted Robertson's niece Leah Parson on Facebook, the BBC reported Wednesday.

Ravi, a daily wage labourer, and B. Surekha, a small-time tailor, especially since doctors warned them of the dangers unless he was put on medication, lifelong.

Lokesh is now 17 and Surekha a widow — Ravi died of a heart attack in February 2017. Since Ravi’s death, it has been more difficult than ever to continue her son’s treatment on her ₹3,000 income, what with two other children — another son and a daughter — to look after. The four live in a government-sanctioned house in Abdullapurmet, Hayatnagar.

She also gets ₹2,000 pension from the government, but even with that, managing daily expenses and Lokesh’s medical care has been nothing short of a struggle.

Worse, she has to repay several outstanding loans. Due to the financial crisis, she had to dig into her lifetime savings and take more loans from relatives.

Despite all of it, she could not continue paying her children’s school fees as a result of which her elder son had to drop out of school.

Lokesh, too, had to discontinue education as teachers asked that he have someone by his side throughout the duration of school hours. Her daughter, however, continues going to a government school.

“Lokesh’s medicines for a month cost around ₹4,000. He needs two rounds of blood transfusion too. We have to spend ₹1,000 to travel between home and the blood bank. I stopped taking loans as people started questioning how I intend to repay it. I request people to donate money for his treatment or buy us the medicines so that my son can live,” says Surekha.

Both Republican presidents of my adulthood, in fact, were elected by minorities. They benefited from a constitutional anachronism and went on to inflict grievous harm to our country. The first lied us into war, allowed his goons to operate a torture regime, let a major American city drown through incompetence and neglect, allowed lobbyists to plunder the federal bureaucracy, then crashed the global economy on a scale not seen since the Great Depression.

The second has been so crass and narcissistic that we’ve retconned the first into a decent human being. (He gave Michelle Obama candy one time. Wasn’t that sweet?)

Since taking office nearly three years ago, Donald Trump has systematically rolled back environmental regulations even as the effects of climate change become undeniable. He’s eviscerated protections for LGBTQ citizens. He’s ripped immigrant children from their mothers and thrown families in cages. He’s put a white supremacist in charge of immigration policy and catered to white nationalists. He’s nurtured petty grievances and publicly attacked teenagers. He’s lied more than fifteen thousand times so far in office, according to The Washington Post. He also became the only president to be impeached during his first term.

And he’s appointed a third of the federal judiciary—a feat made possible by Mitch McConnell’s unprecedented blockade of judicial seats while Barack Obama was president—a legacy that will far outlive any other “accomplishment.” The American Bar Association has rated five of these appointments (and two others whose nominations were withdrawn) “not qualified”—including one who, in October, it deemed “arrogant, lazy, an ideologue, and lacking in knowledge.”

Senate Republicans confirmed him anyway. The Trump administration had already ended the ABA’s formal role in vetting judges. The ABA, the leader of a group that supports Trump’s judges complained, was a “liberal dark-money group.” Its advice—which administrations have sought since Eisenhower—should simply be ignored, a Republican senator said.

And so they did. Reality was inconvenient, so they shrugged it aside and invented their own.

That feels like the story of 2019—the story of Robert Mueller, of Ukraine, of impeachment, of Brexit, of the fake border-wall “emergency,” of the resurgence of white nationalism: It was the year truth lost and bullshit prevailed.

By year’s end, the bullshit didn’t even need a foot grounded in the real world. After the editor of the magazine Christianity Today—a publication founded by the late Billy Graham that writes about things like “end times ecology”—called for Trump’s removal from office on the grounds that he is “grossly immoral,” the president went on a funny-if-it-weren’t-insane Twitter tirade, calling Christianity Today a “far left magazine” that “has been doing poorly” and “knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call.” He then said he “won’t be reading ET [sic] again!” as if the latest issue had a regular home on his nightstand.

On cue, nearly two hundred prominent evangelicals reflexively rallied to Trump’s banner, chastising the magazine for calling out a mendacious, thrice-married, philandering libertine who has been accused of sexual assault by two-dozen women. Questioning Trump, they argued, meant questioning the spiritual integrity of his devotees. (Perhaps that’s why they found the look in the mirror so uncomfortable.)

No one blinked at Trump’s assertion that Christianity Today—a magazine rooted in biblical literalism—is some sort of Marxist publication or that his attempted extortion of Ukraine’s president was “routine.”

Of course, throughout the entire Ukrainian affair, and through the entire saga over the Russia investigation, this has also been the Republican Party line—an almost admirably stubborn see-no-evil, hear-no-evil commitment to the president’s innocence and good intentions that has invented strawmen and conspiracy theories and off-the-rails counter-narratives only to see them debunked time and time again, all the while muddying reality’s waters.

Then again, that was the point all along.

Over Christmas, I got into a conversation with a boomer relative about Ukraine. This isn’t someone who reads random things on the Internet or even has a Facebook account, nor is this an uncurious or unintelligent person. And yet, the disinformation—thanks to Fox News and its even more propagandistic cousin, OANN—had permeated.

The conversation went something like this:

What’s the difference between Joe Biden threatening to withhold money from Ukraine to fire the prosecutor who was investigating his son and what Trump did?

The prosecutor wasn’t investigating his son, I replied. And we forced the prosecutor out because he was corrupt. This was done in the interests of American foreign policy. What Trump did helped Trump.

That’s not what the transcript says.

Have you read the transcript?

No.

OK.

But Trump just wanted to investigate the election hacking.

Ukraine had nothing to do with that. If Trump really believes that, he’s a moron. It’s Russian propaganda.

Says who?

Everyone. The FBI. The CIA. The Mueller report. Also, let me explain how servers—

They’re the ones who spied on Trump’s campaign. It’s in that report.

The inspector general’s report? Did you read it?

No.

That’s not what it said.

In the real world, the evidence of Trump’s malignancy—his unfitness for office, his immoral character, his corruption, his lust for power and erosion of democratic norms—is undeniable. But when bullshit wins—when the torrent of nonsense makes it hard for normal people who don’t obsess over government reports to separate the real from the crazy, when a major political party goes all-in on any invented reality and the mainstream media treats this invented reality like a legitimate alternative to the truth—and we no longer operate from an agreed-upon set of facts, the core of our democracy is in peril.

As an observer and student of American politics, 2019 was a long, hard, nerve-racking slog. I fear 2020 is only going to be worse.

Daryl Orr, a multimedia journalist with Scripps station KMGH in Denver, was driving behind an Amazon Prime delivery truck when it lost control in the gusty conditions and crashed on the median of Interstate 25, near the Colorado-Wyoming border. The truck took out a center guardrail, but the driver kept the trailer from tipping over.

The Colorado Department of Transportation later shut down the northbound lanes of I-25 at Wellington, just north of Fort Collins, due to the high winds and bad weather in Wyoming. The National Weather Service in Boulder issued a high wind warning in the area until 5 p.m. local time Wednesday, with winds up to 50 mph and gusts up to 80 mph.

While the I-25 corridor was dealing with extreme winds and blowing snow, further west, a snowstorm was moving into the northern-central mountains. Steamboat Springs was expected to get about a foot of snow, and more than two feet were expected in some of the mountain areas. Along I-70, Vail was also expected to get 8-12 inches in the storm.

Law provides over $190m to help jurisdictions expedite processing of rape kits

There are more than 100,000 untested rape kits across the United States

President Trump has signed into law a bill to provide funding for the states to reduce the backlog in testing rape kits - a set of forensic evidence collected after an assault is reported.

The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act, 2019 provides funding from the Justice Department to help local governments expedite processing of rape kits and offer quicker resolutions in sexual assault cases.

The Debbie Smith Act, 2004 was named after a victim who was attacked in 1989 and whose evidence was not tested until five years after the assault.

In a statement from Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, the White House said the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act would ensure that more sexual predators are brought to justice: “We know that DNA is much more likely than fingerprints to result in the identification of a criminal, yet thousands of rape kits currently sit untested in labs and on police storage shelves across the Nation,” said Grisham, who went on to say that the President was proud to work with Congress to achieve this bipartisan reauthorization.

ABC reports that there are over 100,000 untested rape kits in communities across the country. The newly reauthorized legislation will provide $151 million to the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, $12.5 million for DNA training and education programs and $30 million for the Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Grant Program.

Since its enactment, The Debbie Smith Act has led to more than 40 percent of DNA matches in rape and sexual assault cases. While funding has traditionally been partisan, the law got caught up in a macro and deeply partisan debate over the Violence Against Women Act earlier this year.

Continued funding will allow victims to more expediently seek justice, particularly in jurisdictions with statutes of limitations on these crimes.", Sexually assault,3

Extinction Rebellion (XR) Cambridge has threatened to bring the city to a halt with a 'week-long roadblock' if their demands for 'climate and social justice' are not met.

This afternoon (January 1), XR Cambridge and XR Youth Cambridge published the ultimatum via social media.

They said if the demands are not met, XR would initiate a week-long roadblock in an undisclosed location in Cambridge from February 16.

The 'institutions of Cambridge' - Cambridge University, Cambridgeshire County Council and Cambridge City Council - are each required to take action.









The demands published by XR are as follows:

The University of Cambridge must cut ties with the fossil fuel industry.

Cambridge City Council must hold a Citizens’ Assembly on Climate Justice.

Cambridgeshire County Council must work with other relevant regional authorities to provide a plan for a just transition away from an inadequate transport system reliant on fossil fuels.



The statement continues: ""The effects of the climate and ecological emergency are falling more heavily on disadvantaged and marginalised communities around the world, including in the UK.

""Any attempt to address the climate crisis must seek to bring justice to these communities.

14267,3b1d4c7a851f44c607e3cc057408e85b,"US Chief Justice John Roberts will be a central figure in the ongoing drama of the Donald Trump presidency in coming months.

He is due to preside over a Senate impeachment trial, while the Supreme Court he leads will rule on a titanic clash over the president's attempts

to keep his financial records secret.

The expected impeachment trial will focus on accusations that Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, who aspires to defeat Trump in a November election.

The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved two articles of impeachment on Dec. 18, paving the way for the trial in the Senate, led by Trump's fellow Republicans.

The normally reserved and mild-mannered Roberts, 64, will have the largely symbolic role of presiding officer, with senators casting the crucial votes.

In his end-of-year message on Tuesday, Roberts hinted at a past disagreement with Trump, saying an independent judiciary was a ""key source of national unity and stability,"" and called on his judicial colleagues to promote public confidence and trust by reflecting on their duty to judge without fear or favor.

Trump has repeatedly criticized federal courts and judges who have blocked his policies, while some Democratic lawmakers have suggested that the Supreme Court's conservative majority is motivated mainly by politics instead of interpreting the law.

In his message Roberts also cautioned against disinformation amplified by the internet and social media - an accusation that Trump has faced when he uses his Twitter account to retweet unfounded rumor.

It is in the marble-lined corridors of the Supreme Court across the street from the Capitol Building, hidden from the TV cameras, where Roberts wields real power.

Known for his cautious approach to major cases, he holds one of just nine votes that will decide by the end of June whether Trump's financial records can be disclosed to Democratic-led congressional committees and a New York prosecutor.

The court's rulings in those cases – on the power of Congress and local prosecutors to investigate a sitting president – will set precedents that may affect not just Trump but also future presidents.

The impeachment trial will be an unusual and potentially uncomfortable period for the low-key Roberts, who prefers to fly under the radar even while he has navigated the conservative-majority court in a rightward direction over the last decade and a half.

""My sense is that the chief doesn't want to make himself the story,"" said Sarah Binder, a scholar at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. Roberts declined to comment.

During a rare public appearance in New York in September, Roberts appeared concerned about the hyperpartisan politics of Washington under Trump.

""When you live in a polarized political environment, people tend to see everything in those terms. That's not how we at the court function,"" he said.

Those who know Roberts, including former law clerks, say that he would take his role seriously. As a history buff, he is likely reading up on the previous impeachment trials of Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, they said.

14287,2cb0806e6765cbce17e36505b50e1aaf,"Real estate interests got a butt-kicking in Albany this year — but state legislators might not be done.

The new legislative session starts next month, and it’s an election year. With some incumbents likely to push pro-tenant bills to ward off liberal or socialist challengers, real estate industry insiders still reeling from June’s rent-law overhaul don’t expect the leftward lurch to stop anytime soon.

“It’s scary,” an executive at a large New York City multifamily owner, who requested anonymity, said of the progressive proposals and the political climate.

Add to that a $6.1 billion budget gap that has lawmakers thinking about raising taxes, almost certainly on the people who buy high-end real estate.

“Do you cut spending or do you raise revenue?” Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie told reporters Tuesday. “For us in the Assembly, we always believe in raising revenue.”

Many industry folks believe New Yorkers already pay too much. “Why would anyone want to live here that has means to live somewhere else?” said a senior executive from a major real estate company. “These taxes are insane.”

The June 23 primary election also means that whatever Albany does will likely happen in the first few months so lawmakers have time to return to their districts to campaign. New York state primaries were previously held in September.

“No one wants to be in Albany in June when they have elections,” said Joe Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association. “Everything is going to be wrapped up before the budget process [which ends April 1]. Then they’ll let people escape.”

Here are five things real estate interests fear might pass in the upcoming session.

Pied-à-terre tax

The real estate industry narrowly escaped a tax on non-primary, high-priced homes earlier this year.

When it appeared likely to pass, developer Will Zeckendorf went to Albany and tapped lobbyist Patrick Jenkins, who has close ties to Speaker Carl Heastie. The two were college roommates and Jenkins later served as Heastie’s chief of staff. As late as 2016 he was still on Heastie’s payroll as a consultant.

Jenkins was the right lobbyist to stop the pied-à-terre levy, which fizzled within two weeks as the industry rallied. Several developers called the sponsor, Manhattan state Sen. Brad Hoylman, to warn of the impact the measure would have on their business. Critics flagged that owner-occupied co-ops would be unfairly taxed by the legislation. And the Citizens Budget Commission — whose trustees include representatives from the Durst Organization, Related, SL Green, Tishman Speyer and Vornado Realty — published a report saying the tax might have counterproductive effects on the market and the economy.

“They basically went to the playbook of how to kill a bill and flipped through every page,” Hoylman said at the time.

Perhaps most importantly, the industry pitched what it considered a more palatable alternative: higher transfer taxes on expensive home purchases. The legislature passed that instead.

But the pied-à-terre tax bill is expected to be reintroduced in 2020 with strengthened language.

“There was some hard lobbying by REBNY against pied-à-terre, and the two different assessment mechanisms in the legislative drafting seemed vulnerable to legal challenge,” said Michael Kink, executive director of the Strong Economy for All Coalition, a labor-community coalition. “We’re going to be making the case that there is still a good reason to impose a New York tax on the international billionaires and multi-billionaires.”

“Flip” tax

Two Brooklyn lawmakers, state Senator Julia Salazar and Assembly member Erik Dilan — whose father she unseated in 2018 — are teaming up to push for a tax on the sale of real estate within 18 months of its purchase.

Real estate investors are pouring into Cypress Hills and East New York to offer homeowners cash buyouts for their single-family homes in the Brooklyn neighborhoods. House-flippers have made quick profits on many Central Brooklyn properties.

Michelle Neugebauer, president of the Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation, said the wave of real estate speculation in that neighborhood has targeted seniors and homeowners in financial distress, encouraging them to cash out or escape debt.

“Usually the home-flippers target people who have been in foreclosure in long-term and senior houses,” Neugebauer said. “Try to get them to sell their property, promising to get them out of trouble or whipping up ‘now the neighborhood has been on the upswing, make a quick buck,’ stuff they’re peddling.”

Neugebauer said she thinks the progressive tilt of Democratic politics will motivate lawmakers to back a bill to limit real estate speculation, regardless of whether their own constituencies are directly affected.

“We want to build on that momentum. We think there’s a real appetite to look at the legislation,” she said. “Some of the co-sponsors don’t even represent homeowners, but they quickly connect the dots that it’s real estate speculation and displacing people.”

Expanded mortgage-recording tax

Manhattan Assemblymember Harvey Epstein is drafting a bill to reshape the state mortgage-recording tax, which is currently 0.5 percent for mortgages of any amount (and 0.8% in the 12 counties serviced by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority).

“A $1 and $100 million mortgage are different animals,” Epstein said, “and they should not be treated in the same way.”

The lawmaker said he expects a more progressive structure to be opposed by luxury developers, but private equity players may benefit.

“Owners of higher-end, larger real estate projects say it’s already hard enough to do business in New York,” Epstein acknowledged. “[The tax] will make it harder to do bank financing. They will have to turn to a separate market, either private equity or a non-traditional lending market.”

According to sources, the bill would also provide a dedicated revenue stream for the New York City Housing Authority. That would help it gain support among many legislators in the city.

“Good cause” eviction

“Good cause” eviction is high on activists’ list for Albany next year after being stripped from the rent-law legislation that landlords otherwise despised. But the measure, which would make evictions much harder to achieve, is expected to face opposition from some upstate lawmakers skeptical of limiting landlords’ options for ousting troublesome tenants.

William Magnarelli, an Assembly member from Syracuse, voiced his opposition to the measure earlier this year. Real estate industry professionals warn that it would have a disastrous effect on their business and deter investment.

Albany state Sen. Neil Breslin, who sponsored the bill to allow municipalities to opt-in to rent stabilization, said his upstate colleagues are more reluctant about the eviction measure.

“I do think ‘good cause’ eviction is a hard sell,” Breslin said. “That’s a ways away here.”

Elimination of property tax breaks

The same coalition of tenant groups that pushed for the changes to the New York rent law in June are also set on eliminating tax exemptions for new development through the state’s Affordable New York program.

The 421a and 485a programs give tax exemptions to developers of residential and mixed-use properties, respectively. The coalition says the programs cost New York billions of dollars and “provide no meaningful affordable housing benefit” because many of the lower-rent units they produce are still too expensive for many New Yorkers.

But an executive at a prominent New York City multifamily firm said the elimination of 421a would have a profound impact on construction.

“They’re saying there’s no benefit from 421a — what about the construction jobs?” the person said. “If all that stops, the city’s done.”

The lesser-known 485a program is used more in Buffalo than in any other city, according to a recent analysis by the Public Accountability Initiative. The group projected the total value of the tax exemption in Buffalo from this year through 2030 at $66.9 million, which could go up in smoke if tenant activists have their way.

14394,5104031a8c8391e5c839e9deb386e759,"NEW DELHI: India will work out its own mechanisms for theatre commands, says the chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat , in the backdrop of the urgent need to build an integrated land-air-sea war-fighting machinery for a greater combat punch despite the ongoing fund crunch for military modernisation.“There are methods of doing ‘theaterisation’. We don’t have to copy from western methods or others. We can have our own systems. We will jointly work out mechanisms…I think it will work,” said Gen Rawat, after taking the tri-service guard of honour at South Block on Wednesday. Though Gen Rawat did not spell out the details, sources said he has been tasked by the government to initiate and spearhead doctrinal and transformational changes as well as prepare a roadmap for the first new theatre command to be set up in four to five years.This, of course, will take some doing because the Army, Navy and IAF zealously guard their turfs. India’s only theatre or geographical command in the strategically-located Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, which places all the assets and manpower of the three services under one operational commander, has largely failed to realise its potential due to inter-service rivalry, general politico-bureaucratic apathy and funding problems since it was set up in 2001.The PMO and defence establishment have discussed the need to have integrated commands over the last few years. There was even a proposal to establish theatre commands in the shape of one or two (one each for west and east of Nepal ) for the “northern borders” with China, a western command for Pakistan , a counter-insurgency operations command and one southern or two peninsular commands for the maritime borders. A strategic air command, in turn, could be handled by the IAF.But the IAF had strongly opposed the move, stressing it would be operationally unwise to divide the country’s “limited air assets” among different theatre commands. The force, after all, has just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed for requisite deterrence against any collusive threat from Pakistan and China.Similar is the case with other critical platforms like AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) and mid-air refuelling aircraft. “The entire country should be treated as one theatre. We have shown through ‘Gagan Shakti’ and other exercises that the IAF can swiftly switch its assets from the western to eastern front, and vice-versa, if the need arises,” said a senior IAF officer.But the dominant opinion in the defence establishment is that the time has come for India — which has as many as 17 single-service commands — to move towards integrated commands to save resources and prepare for wars of the future.Gen Rawat, on his part, said, “The task is cut out for the CDS to integrate the three services and enhance their capabilities through teamwork. We must ensure the 1+1+1 combine of the three services adds up to 5 or 7, and not 3. Synergy is needed. The whole should be more than the sum of the parts.” He added he would strive to achieve jointness in operations, planning, procurements, logistics, transport, training and the like within the three-year deadline set by the government."," Threaten, not specified below",3
14505,08fdebaab6ea141d4481f7ba82cf27ff,"New York — A US jury on Monday cleared a sales representative for a Lebanese shipbuilding company of charges that he helped to defraud US investors in bonds backed by the Mozambican government.

Jean Boustani, 41, was acquitted of the charges by a jury following a trial in federal court in Brooklyn, which shed new light on a corruption scandal that contributed to Mozambique's debt default in 2016.

“Jean never met, spoke to, had a relationship, or lied to any investor,” Randall Jackson, one of Boustani's lawyers, said in a statement after the verdict. “This is a critical fact.”

The case involved three contracts awarded by Mozambique to Boustani's employer, Privinvest, to build a coastal defence system, a tuna fishing fleet and a shipyard.

The projects were financed with nearly $2bn in loans from Credit Suisse and Russian lender VTB.

Prosecutors said Boustani, a Lebanese citizen, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to Mozambican officials and Credit Suisse bankers to secure the contracts and loans.

Credit Suisse sold parts of those loans to investors, including some in the US, who were falsely told that all the money was being used for the legitimate government projects, according to prosecutors.

While Privinvest did deliver ships and equipment to Mozambique, prosecutors said, their value was grossly inflated.

Eventually the loans defaulted and investors lost their money.

Boustani, who testified in his own defence at the trial, never disputed that he paid officials, but said he had no role in packaging the loans for investors.

His lawyers argued that the case did not belong in the US, which Boustani never visited.

Three Credit Suisse bankers previously pleaded guilty in the case. Two of them, Andrew Pearse and Surjan Singh, testified against Boustani at the trial.

Former Mozambique finance minister Manuel Chang was also charged in the case. Prosecutors said Chang, who is fighting extradition in SA, secretly had the country’s government guarantee the loans in exchange for bribes. Chang denies wrongdoing.

When the loan guarantees became public in 2016, foreign donors to cut off support and Mozambique defaulted on its sovereign debt. It remains among the world’s most indebted countries.

BEIJING, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of protesters on Tuesday stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, mourning for the Hashd Shaabi members killed by a U.S. attack in Iraq on Sunday, which has prompted the United States to send additional troops to the Middle East.

""Approximately 750 soldiers will deploy to the region immediately and additional forces from the IRF (the Immediate Response Force) are prepared to deploy over the next several days,"" said Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.

""This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,"" Esper added.

Many of the protesters, wearing Hashd Shaabi military uniforms, rallied outside the embassy chanting slogans condemning U.S. airstrikes. The protest then turned violent as protesters set ablaze a guard tower and the outer gate of the embassy.

Hashd Shaabi, an Iraqi state-sponsored umbrella organization formed by Iraq's Shi'ite-led paramilitary Kata'ib Hezbollah (KH), said on Monday that U.S. drones bombarded its military bases near Iraq's border with Syria, which killed 25 people and wounded 51 others.

The attack came two days after a rocket barrage hit a U.S. military camp, killing a U.S. contractor and wounding others, which the United States blamed on the KH, a militia allegedly backed by Iran, the long-time foe of the United States. Both are the most influential players in the region.

U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday that ""Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack,"" which ""they will be held fully responsible (for).""

Iraq on Monday condemned the U.S. attack, saying it was ""a violation of Iraq's sovereignty"" in a statement by the Iraqi National Security Council, and denied any role in the recent deadly attacks on the U.S. forces.

""This unsubstantiated U.S. claim cannot justify the bombing and killing of people in violation of international regulations,"" Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiee said.

Rabiee said that the U.S. attack was another proof of its ""destructive"" role in the region, particularly in Iraq, and it once again showed that ""as long as the U.S. keeps its uncalled-for presence in Iraq and Syria, peace will be unattainable for all.""", Accuse of aggression,3

But whether you’re just waking up or are already struggling to make it to your local coffee shop, there are things you can do to help yourself recover. Alok Patel, MD, a physician and medical contributor, shared some best practices with Yahoo Lifestyle to help you get through the day. First, he says, it’s important to understand what’s actually happening when you’re hungover.

“When alcohol is being broken down by your liver, your liver will create this byproduct called acetaldehyde. When this builds up in your body, you start to get some of those toxic effects of drinking,” Patel tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “You not only get dehydrated but you lose a lot of electrolytes and that will leave you feeling groggy but also with a huge headache.”

So what can be done to fix this?

Patel cautions against opting for the classic “fixes” like a big, greasy breakfast or huge doses of caffeine. Both of these, he says, could actually cause more dehydration and upset stomach. Instead, Patel says the key to feeling better is hydration. “If you’re hungover, drink water,” he suggests. “It’s also a good thing to take in some electrolytes whether it’s Gatorade or Pedialyte.”

Overall, Patel says that once you’ve nursed a hangover, it might be a good time to think about making different choices. “Get up, get moving, and then try to think about drinking less next time,” he says. “Because truth be told we shouldn’t be preventing hangovers — we should be listening to our bodies and drinking less in general.”

The Britain-based war monitor said several explosions were heard in the city of Jableh, located 25 kilometers (16 miles) south of Latakia, early on Wednesday as militants launched projectiles at the military facility.

None of the projectiles struck the site as Russian systems intercepted and shot them down.

Back on December 23, the Observatory reported several loud booms in the vicinity of Jableh.

Local sources, requesting not to be named, said they were the sounds of Russian air defense systems, which targeted unmanned aerial vehicles as they were flying over the area.

Car bomb kills 3 in Turkish-controlled northern Syrian town

At least three people lost their lives and four others sustained injuries when a car rigged with explosives went off in an area of Syria's northern province of Raqqah, controlled by Turkish military forces and their allied militants ever since they launched a ground offensive against militants from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG).

Syria’s official news agency SANA said the attack took place on Wednesday in the village of Suluk, which is located in the Tal Abyad district of the province.

There was no immediate claim for the act of terror.

A car bomb killed at least eight civilians, including a woman and a child, and wounded 21 others in the same Syrian village on December 23.

On October 9, Turkish military forces and Ankara-backed militants launched a long-threatened cross-border invasion of northeastern Syria in a declared attempt to push YPG militants away from border areas.

Ankara views the US-backed YPG as a terrorist organization tied to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been seeking an autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey since 1984.

On October 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed a memorandum of understanding that asserted YPG militants had to withdraw from the Turkish-controlled ""safe zone"" in northeastern Syria within 150 hours, after which Ankara and Moscow would run joint patrols around the area.

The announcement was made hours before a US-brokered five-day truce between Turkish and Kurdish-led forces was due to expire.", Carry out car bombing,3
14680,353d87fadeb5238260c78b46320adc0f,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared an end to moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and threatened a demonstration of a “new strategic weapon” soon.

Analysts said the announcement, reported by state media yesterday, amounted to Kim putting a missile “to Donald Trump’s head” -- but warned that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Washington was swift to respond, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Kim to “take a different course” and stressing that the US wanted “peace not confrontation” with the North, while Trump played down the development.

Speaking to Fox News and CBS after Kim’s announcement, Pompeo said a resumption of nuclear and missile tests would be “deeply disappointing”.

“We hope that Chairman Kim will take a different course... that he’ll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,” Pompeo said.

Pyongyang has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests, the last of them 16 times more powerful than the Hiroshima blast, according to the highest estimates.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been a centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump, but little tangible progress.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim’s “promise” to him not to carry them out, and has downplayed launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February, and the North set the US an end-of-year deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a “new way”.

“There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,” the official KCNA news agency cited Kim as telling top ruling party officials.

“The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,” he added, referring to the North by its official name.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers’ Party was an indication of a major policy shift.

State television showed veteran newsreader Ri Chun Hee reading out the KCNA dispatch over footage of Kim addressing the officials and general imagery of the country.

The broadcast appeared to stand in place of Kim’s usual New Year speech -- normally a key moment in the North Korean political calendar.

Kim acknowledged the impact of international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programmes, but made clear that the North was willing to pay the price to preserve its nuclear capability.

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it takes more tangible steps towards giving them up.

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carries out a long-range missile test.

“We want peace, not confrontation,” he added, with Seoul’s unification ministry adding that a strategic weapon test “would not help denuclearisation negotiations”.

Trump himself was emollient, saying that he thought Kim was “a man of his word” and that at their Singapore summit “We did sign a contract, talking about denuclearisation”.

An ICBM launch would be likely to frustrate China, the North’s key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own back yard."," Threaten, not specified below",3

As people began to flee the area this morning the roads were clogged with traffic, with Transport Minister Andrew Constance calling it the “largest relocation out of the region ever”.

About 50,000 homes are without power, phone networks are down, fuel is running low, major supermarkets are closed and people are queuing for up to three hours to get food.

“We cannot overstate the potential risk of more damage and more destruction,” RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. “There is a big effort between today and tomorrow to get as many people out of the south coast as we can.”

Kosciuszko National Park has been evacuated with everyone ordered out by 10am tomorrow ahead of Saturday’s predicted firestorm.

“This is an essential measure to protect life,” National Parks and Wildlife has warned.

Bushfires in Victoria also continue to burn, with the number of people missing in the state increasing to 17 and grave fears held for their safety.

Premier Daniel Andrews said the missing 17 were residents, not firefighters.

“They may have been trying to defend their homes,” he said. “That number may grow or indeed people may report to authorities. We do hold very significant fears for the welfare of anybody who is missing at this time.”

With at least 10 people dead since Monday, more missing and hundreds of properties destroyed, authorities in NSW and Victoria have warned the death toll is likely to rise.

More than 45 fires are still burning in East Gippsland and in Victoria’s north-east around Corryong, testing more than 1000 firefighters on the front line.

Three of the East Gippsland blazes have combined to form one massive firefront 150km wide.

And firefighters in WA’s south-east are bracing for catastrophic conditions today with Eyre Highway, the only sealed road linking the State to South Australia, closed for another day.

Authorities on the East Coast are warning that this weekend is looming as another horror period, with temperatures expected to soar back into the 40s accompanied by strong erratic winds in fire-affected areas, posing a grave risk to life and property.

NSW Police opened the Princes Hwy northbound last night as a window opened up for the thousands of holidaymakers who have been stranded from Milton to Batemans Bay to head home.

However, the Kings Hwy across to Canberra remains impassable because of bushfires as service stations either could not open because of lack of power or ran out of fuel.

The Rural Fire Service issued a map last night of where tourists were being asked to leave, highlighting an area 250km long from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border, and 160km wide.

The unprecedented onslaught of fires has laid waste to communities all along the East Coast, such as Lake Conjola where 89 homes were destroyed and there is no mobile reception and little running water.

“It was like a war zone. Or something out of a movie,” local Paul Murphy, 41, said.

The NSW Government is in a race against time to open roads and get thousands of people moving, with Premier Gladys Berejiklian warning that after milder weather, extreme fire conditions will return on Saturday.

“We’re assuming that on Saturday weather conditions will be at least as bad as they were (on Tuesday),” Ms Berejiklian said.

And she said communities needed to prepare for the possibility of more fatalities.

“I do want everyone to brace themselves,” she said, while visiting Batemans Bay where people have been left sleeping in their cars. “Many people who have been here for decades are just completely shocked that the fire reached as far as it did.”

15068,1137d10c7371d1e29b130748718142c9,"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday he would seek parliamentary immunity from prosecution in the three corruption cases he faces, a move that could delay criminal proceedings against him for months.

Netanyahu was indicted in November on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust over allegations that he granted state favours worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media barons in return for gifts and favourable coverage.

He denies any wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a witch-hunt by the media and left to remove a popular right-wing leader.

More:

A trial cannot begin once an immunity request is made, and Netanyahu announced the politically risky move in a speech on live television just four hours before a deadline for an application was to expire.

Netanyahu, who was re-elected leader of the ruling Likud party last week, has often accused judicial and law enforcement officials of trying to drive him from office and said only the voting public can choose who will lead the country.

He said in his address that the charges against him were politically motivated and that he was entitled to Parliament's protection.

His allies have issued stern warnings against what they call an ""activist"" court overstepping its authority.

Normally, a request for immunity would need to be approved by a parliamentary committee and then submitted to a full vote. But the committee charged with handling such matters does not exist because a government was never formed after September's election.

The attorney general cannot file the indictment until the question of immunity is settled, delaying any court proceedings.

Amid deep political deadlock, Parliament seems unlikely to decide the issue before Israel's March 2 election.

Netanyahu will need the support of 61 of its 120 legislators for immunity to be granted, the same majority that eluded him in attempts to form a government after national ballots in April and September."," Threaten, not specified below",3

MUNDELEIN, Ill. -- The sale of marijuana for recreational purposes became legal Wednesday, Jan. 1 in Illinois to the delight of pot fans — many who began lining up hours early at dispensaries. This, as law enforcement in Wisconsin continued to warn Badger State residents going across the border for marijuana that it remains illegal in Wisconsin.

FOX6 News found a growing crowd at Rise Mundelein, with lines reaching around the building on New Year's Day.

""This has been a long time coming and I'm happy to be a part of it,"" said Troy Ealom, customer.

""We're not gonna run out of product,"" said Ben Kovler, CEO of Green Thumb Industries. ""We may run out of one kind of variety or something, but we have plenty of alternatives behind it.""

Some waited five hours under heat lamps for their chance to buy marijuana flowers, edibles, and oils -- some coming from Wisconsin.

""I'm gonna buy a whole zip if they let me buy a whole zip, some edibles, some weed concentrate, wax, dabs,"" said Izzy Miller of Kenosha.

""Just the feeling,"" said Jason Sachs of Three Lakes. ""I don't know. I like being high I guess.""

""The main thing for people from Wisconsin to know is it's still illegal to bring product across state lines, so what's bought in Illinois needs to stay in Illinois and be consumed in Illinois,"" said Kovler.

""I'm staying here tonight for a couple days, so they don't have to worry about me coming back to Wisconsin at all,"" said Sachs.

Inside, staff worked at 11 registers in an effort to get customers in and out of the door.

""Work all day long on my feet,"" said Miller. ""I come home, smoke me a fat (expletive) wood, I'm good.""

Officials said they expected large crowds through the end of the week.

Illinois already allowed medical marijuana, but it is now the 11th state to allow its use and sale for recreational purposes. The law approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker allows people 21 or older to possess of up to 30 grams (1.06 ounces) of cannabis flower and up to 5 grams (0.17 ounces) of cannabis concentrate.

Cannabis sales could generate $250 million for Illinois by 2022, according to estimates by state officials.

Neighboring Michigan made recreational marijuana legal starting Dec. 1. Missouri voters made medical marijuana legal in 2018, but the state is still working on licensing businesses. The sale and use of weed for any reason still are illegal in Indiana and Wisconsin.

Michigan has 23 retailers licensed for adult-use recreational sales. Its single-transaction limit is the same for residents and non-residents.

In Illinois, nearly three dozen dispensaries have been issued licenses to sell recreational marijuana.

A key part of Illinois' law is the expungement of some low-level marijuana convictions. On Tuesday, Pritzker granted more than 11,000 such pardons."," Threaten, not specified below",3
15179,bdd41466d0cf33d1cb647652fd92186d,"Protests at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad

By Ahmed Aboulenein

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups who stormed the U.S. Embassy's perimeter and hurled rocks in two days of protests withdrew on Wednesday after Washington dispatched extra troops and threatened reprisals against Tehran.

The demonstrators, angry at U.S. air strikes against the Tehran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group in which at least 25 people were killed, threw stones at the building while U.S. forces stationed on the rooftops fired tear gas to disperse them.

By mid-afternoon, most appeared to have obeyed a call to withdraw, issued by the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) umbrella group of mainly Shi'ite militia, which said the demonstrators' message had been heard.

Young men used palm tree branches to sweep the street in front of the embassy compound. Others packed up equipment and vans arrived to take people away. Some left to set up a protest camp in front of a nearby hotel.

Iraq's military said all protesters had left by the evening.

The protests marked a new turn in the shadow war between Washington and Tehran playing out across the Middle East.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces a re-election campaign in 2020, accused Iran of orchestrating the violence. He threatened on Tuesday to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want war.

Iran, under severe economic duress from punishing U.S. sanctions put in place by Trump, denied responsibility.

The unrest followed U.S. air raids on Sunday against Kataib Hezbollah bases in retaliation for missile attacks that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq last week.

On Tuesday, crowds chanted: 'Death to America!', lit fires, and smashed surveillance cameras. They breached an outer perimeter of the embassy but did not enter the main compound.





BIGGEST U.S. EMBASSY

The huge embassy, built along the banks of the Tigris River in central Baghdad's fortified ""green zone"" during the American occupation following the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, is the biggest U.S. diplomatic mission in the world.

Washington said its diplomats were safe and it was rushing hundreds of extra troops to the region.

The State Department said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decided to postpone his upcoming trip to Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Cyprus to remain in Washington and monitor the situation in Iraq. [L1N29606E]

Pompeo spoke on Wednesday with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the State Department said.

Pompeo said on Twitter that Abdul Mahdi had agreed that Iraq ""would continue to uphold its responsibility to keep U.S. personnel secure and would move the Iran-backed attackers away from @USEmbBaghdad.""

Pompeo wrote on Twitter he thanked the emir in the call ""for Qatar’s solidarity in the face of Iran’s malign regional influence,"" including the attack on the embassy in Baghdad.

The embassy said all public consular operations were suspended and all future appointments canceled.

The anti-American action came after months of protests in Iraq against the government and the Iran-backed militias that support it. Many Iraqis complain their country has become a battlefield for a proxy war for influence between Washington and Tehran, and that their leaders are too beholden to outside powers.

Iraq's government has long faced frictions in its close relations with the two foes. Trump spoke to Abdul Mahdi on Tuesday and demanded Iraq protect the embassy.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday condemned the U.S. attacks. Iran summoned a Swiss envoy, who represents U.S. interests in Tehran, to complain about what it described as ""warmongering"" words from Washington.

U.S. officials said 750 extra troops would initially be based out of Kuwait and as many as 4,000 troops could be sent to the region in coming days.

More than 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq supporting local forces. The air strikes have galvanized calls inside Iraq to expel them.

Many in the crowd outside the embassy said ending Washington's presence in Iraq was their main goal.





'DEVIL'S DEN'

Despite decades of enmity between Iran and the United States, Iran-backed militias and U.S. forces found themselves on the same side during Iraq's 2014-2017 war against Islamic State fighters, with both powers helping the government recapture territory from militants who had overrun a third of Iraq.

But this summer has been extraordinary - more than five million hectares burned, at least 16 people dead nationally and several missing in Victoria, at least 1300 homes gone, the eastern seaboard choked by smoke and thousands of people trapped on beaches, driven to the ocean by flames.

And it's only early January.

There are months left to run in the fire season, which began early in NSW when the first fires broke out in September. As well as the threat the fires pose to towns and small communities across Australia, they also pose a threat to the Morrison Government. There is deep concern across Australia and internationally about the extremes of weather this summer.

At the risk of adding another feelpinion to an already overcrowded field, it does have the feel of a tipping point, that enough is enough and the government must do something about it.

On Tuesday, Scott Morrison hit the right note when he called in the Australian Defence Force. The decision showed the government understood the scale of the crisis and was prepared to throw everything at it. The sight of a massive Navy ship arriving into Mallacoota on Thursday, and Army and Navy helicopters clattering about over remote towns in Gippsland, will give residents confidence that help is on its way, along with much-needed supplies.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has looked flat-footed and defensive.



But until then, Morrison had looked flat-footed and defensive.

His sudden announcement last Sunday that he'd be providing one-off payments to compensate volunteer firefighters up to $6000 for the weeks and they'd spent on the fire front looked rushed and a bit panicked, despite his claims they'd been working on it for some time. And the deal was done initially with only the (Liberal) Berejiklian government in NSW, making it look like a hasty deal cobbled together with a friendly government to get the PM out a political jam.

South Australia has since signed up and while the Labor states of Queensland and Victoria were playing silly buggers over the offer, it would be a brave government that stops its volunteer firefighters from getting $6000 in free money from Canberra when their fellow volunteers across the border can have it. Indeed Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk has now signed up.

Then there was the ill-timed holiday Morrison took overseas with his wife and daughters.

He works hard and should be entitled to a week off. Comparisons with former Victorian police commissioner Christine Nixon leaving her post on Black Saturday were hysterical and unfair. But the optics were bad, as Sydney-siders continued to breathe in toxic smoke and two volunteer firefighters died. He lost a lot of political capital over it.

Anyway, all of this is reactive. The elephant is the room is climate change and the government's response to it.

No political party in Australia had been able to deliver a sustainable, acceptable policy on climate change.

Morrison acknowledges human intervention is contributing to climate change. Yet formulating an energy and climate policy has been eluding political parties and leaders for years, with Rudd, Gillard, Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison (so far) all unable to legislate a long-term policy.

Since the Coalition party room killed off the National Energy Agreement, the market is in flux, unsure where to invest. The governmental response seems piecemeal, such as underwriting a new gas plant in Dandenong.

It's almost impossible to have a sensible debate here on climate change. Thanks to the shouty types on social media, it's become heresy to point out that Australia directly produces just 1.3 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, so can't unilaterally shift the dial in any meaningful way.

Equally, Australia, as a wealthy, developed democracy, should be showing leadership and sitting near the head of the global pack in emission reduction strategies.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack has complained about ""woke capital city greenies'' agitating about climate change when fires were burning.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack.

But look at some of those who have identified climate change as an issue - the Reserve Bank, the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Department of Home Affairs. Not a dreadlock or home-knit jumper to be seen.

In an opinion piece published on these pages yesterday, Prime Minister Morrison said: ""Australians have never been fussed about trying to impress people overseas.''

But surely he'd prefer that the international media was not devoting thousands of words to Australia' bushfire crisis, with photos of Sydney Harbour bathed in toxic orange smoke, our wildlife burning to death and scared people crammed on to eerie orange beaches escaping the flames.

Before Christmas the French daily Liberation took out its entire front page with a high-impact photograph of a firefighter and a burning tree and a headline which translated as ""Australia an incendiary climate''.

""Three million hectares burned, Sydney plunges into an orange mist, the out of control fires ravaging a country in the middle of a drought sound like a new alert on climate change,'' it screamed.

Across pages two, three and four, there were more confronting photos and a picture of Morrison under a headline which read, ""Prime Minister in flagrant denial''.

Coverage such as that in the centre-left Liberation won't move a vote in Australia, so Morrison won't lose sleep over it. But he should be up in the wee hours thinking about how to better protect Australia from such disasters in the first place.

15237,a00bc4318f3e58c70b03bd055a0e2d89,"HONG KONG - Hong Kong's celebratory mood on the first day of 2020 was marred by tear gas and water cannons deployed by police on a largely peaceful crowd, and the arrest of some 400 people at a march attended by hundreds of thousands in what has been a months-long anti-government movement.

Senior Superintendent Ng Lok Chun told reporters late Wednesday that police arrested about 400 people during the New Year's Day march on charges including illegal assembly and the possession of offensive weapons. He said police fired tear gas after being surrounded by protesters who were throwing objects at them. He blamed radical protesters for ""hijacking"" and disrupting the march.

The Asian financial hub has been roiled by civil unrest for seven months, and protesters say they will not back down in their demands for universal suffrage and an independent probe into police brutality against the movement that saw nearly 6,500 people arrested. The anti-government movement was sparked by a controversial extradition law that allowed individuals to be sent to China for trial.

Police detain protesters in Hong Kong, Jan. 1, 2020.

Hong Kong's New Year's Eve fireworks display had been canceled for the first time in its 10-year history by officials who cited public safety concerns, but revelers converged nonetheless on the streets of Hong Kong on Tuesday night.

Police deployed a water cannon vehicle to disperse protesters, while armored vehicles cleared roadblocks set up earlier by protesters.

Shortly after midnight, as shouts of ""Happy New Year!"" rang across the city, police in the bustling downtown district of Mongkok fired tear gas at a crowd that set off fireworks and burned roadblocks.

On Wednesday afternoon, hundreds of thousands of people attended an organized demonstration pre-approved by police. The mood at the march, attended by individuals, families and the elderly, was peaceful at the outset. Many chanted slogans, including ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our era!""

Protesters set up barricades with debris and umbrellas in Hong Kong, Jan. 1, 2020.

The atmosphere turned tense shortly after 5 p.m. local time, when police arrested several people for allegedly vandalizing an HSBC bank in Wanchai district, and angry protesters threw objects and began shouting. Riot police then fired rounds of tear gas, and some protesters retaliated by throwing firebombs.

The organizer of the march, Civil Human Rights Front, called off the demonstration at the request of police, but many protesters remained. Police threatened them with warnings, accusing them of taking part in an illegal assembly. The group later said an estimated 1 million people had taken part in the march.

Later that night, police used water cannons on crowds in Wanchai and the financial hub of Central. Protesters had laid bricks across the main road in Central in an attempt to block police from entering the area. A police statement said protesters blocked roads with barricades, dug up bricks from the pavement, and set fire to banks and ATMs.

A protester feeds a flame near an ATM machine during an anti-government demonstration on New Year's Day to call for better governance and democratic reforms in Hong Kong, China, Jan. 1, 2020.

The Civil Human Rights Front condemned police for using ""absurd excuses"" to terminate the march and accused them of failing to listen to the people's voices and infringing upon their right of assembly.

""Hong Kongers shall not back down and peace shall not resume with the ongoing police brutality,"" Civil Human Rights Front said in a statement.

Although many Hong Kongers say they remain determined in their fight for democracy under Chinese rule, some are voicing doubts about the effectiveness of the violent confrontations. Others are calling on fellow Hong Kongers to put pressure on the government by boycotting pro-Beijing businesses and joining labor unions for more effective collective actions, such as strikes.

""I don't want to back down, I feel antagonized by the authorities but I am also hoping for a new direction in the movement,"" said an office administrator who joined the march. ""I hope people can also use other means to put pressure on the government.""

15399,4a25cfe0542503f0bed866e039b3d36b,"OTTAWA - The Trudeau government has long characterized it as a dispassionate policy exercise drawing on expert evidence.

But the political drumbeats are growing louder — at home and abroad — as the federal Liberals come closer to deciding whether to let a Chinese telecom firm help build Canada's next-generation mobile networks.

The development of 5G, or fifth-generation, networks will give people speedier connections and provide vast data capacity to meet the ceaseless demand for emerging applications, like virtual reality and autonomous driving, as more and more things link to the internet.

In Canada, China-based Huawei Technologies, Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are among the leading candidates to help telecommunication firms such as BCE and Telus build their 5G networks.

The opposition Conservatives are pressing the Liberals to deny Huawei a role in assembling the country's 5G infrastructure, alleging it will allow Beijing to spy on Canadians more easily.

Some security experts say Huawei's participation could give it access to an array of digital data gleaned from how, when and where Canadian customers use their electronic devices. In turn, the theory goes, Chinese security agencies could pressure the company into handing over the personal information.

Such fears stem from the fact China’s National Intelligence Law plainly states that Chinese organizations and citizens shall support, assist and co-operate with state intelligence work.

At a forum in Halifax last November, Donald Trump's national security adviser urged Ottawa to bar Huawei from 5G efforts because the technology would be used as a ""Trojan horse"" to undermine Canada.

The warning came a day after China's ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, dismissed the notion Huawei could compromise users' security by installing ""back-door"" channels in equipment, calling it a ""groundless accusation.""

Huawei emphasizes it is not a state-controlled enterprise and that it would never do the bidding of spymasters from China or any other country.

Benjamin Howes, a Huawei Canada vice-president for international media affairs, notes the company's involvement in Canada's existing 4G networks has never led to any such security incident.

He points to Huawei's $650-million investment in research and development in Canada since 2009, with major labs in Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, Ont., Montreal and Vancouver, as well as plans for one in Quebec City.

""In every country where we have a business presence, we're committed to complying with the applicable laws and regulations, and Canada is no different,"" Howes said. ""So we will continue to be compliant, as we have been over the decade that we've been here, with Canadian laws and regulations.""

Ottawa is carrying out a comprehensive review of Huawei’s potential role in 5G that includes a broader, strategic look at how the technology can foster economic growth.

Given the scope of the review, several agencies — namely Public Safety Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Communications Security Establishment, Global Affairs, and Innovation, Science and Economic Development — are taking part.

""We will ensure that our networks are kept secure and will take the appropriate decisions in due course,"" said Scott Bardsley, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.

The government has been tight-lipped about the exercise, but the results are expected relatively soon.

""We respect the process, and we just hope that it's going to be based on technology and security, not politics,"" Howes said.

However, the public debate has already been tinged by political developments.

Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei executive, in December 2018 at the request of the United States, where she is wanted over allegations of violating sanctions on Iran. Her extradition case is before a Canadian court.

The move angered Beijing, and two Canadians working in China were arrested soon after on vague allegations of endangering national security — a move widely seen as retaliation against Ottawa.

The U.S. and Australia, key intelligence allies of Canada, have already taken steps to curb Huawei's participation in 5G networks.

In the House of Commons, the Conservatives have persistently needled the Trudeau government over the issue.

""When will the Liberals ban Huawei?"" Conservative MP Steven Blaney asked Blair during a recent question period.

""Would they rather see Canadians' personal information in the hands of the Chinese?""

Blair's answer underscored the fact the government has long had a security-review program in place to manage cybersecurity risks that might stem from new equipment and services.

""We will continue to work with telecommunication service providers and the vendors through this collaborative program to mitigate the security concerns,"" Blair said. ""We will examine all security, economic and global considerations when making this determination.""

Canada will be watching closely for Britain's coming decision on Huawei's participation in its 5G projects. If Boris Johnson's new government adopts the Australian and U.S. line, it could be more politically challenging for Canada to embrace Huawei.

Ottawa's examination of 5G technology and the associated security and economic dimensions will include ""the careful consideration of our allies' advice,"" Bardsley said.

For its part, Huawei insists it will remain committed to Canada, no matter how the 5G microchips fall.

""Regardless of the decision, our position is we will continue to serve our customers in Canada with our products and networks,"" Howes said. ""And we will continue to enhance our investments in R and D.""

15594,a54fed93b555fb7924a8eab0a899730e,"ORLANDO, Fla. — The state of Florida is urging people to educate themselves about the security risks of at-home DNA tests, following a memo reportedly issued by the Defense Department to military personnel warning them not to use the kits.

""With 20 military bases in our state, it’s significant that the Pentagon recently issued a memo warning about the risks associated with taking at-home DNA tests for members of our military,"" state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said in a news release issued earlier this week. ""In the age of digital hacks, you must do everything you can to protect your information from falling into the wrong hands. As DNA testing becomes more popular, we must ensure consumers — and our military servicemembers — are protected.""

News about the Defense Department's internal memo to service members was first reported by Yahoo! News , followed by an article by The New York Times .

Patronis said that Floridians who may have received a home DNA kit as a holiday gift need to understand that in the wrong hands, the personal information on your ancestral origins, nationality, and health can put your privacy at risk.

The popularity of direct-to-consumer DNA testing kits from private companies such as 23andMe and Ancestry has exploded in recent years, fueled by a stream of stories about adoptees who have found birth parents , families who have reconnected after a long separation, or people who have learned of health histories. Also, through public genealogy databases, cold-case killings — some decades old — are getting a new look.

But the home kits have also raised recent scrutiny over what degree law enforcement investigations should have access to private citizens' information, whether DNA information can be sold, and what the ramifications and legal avenues are if genetic information is hacked.

The DOD is the latest entity to raise concerns about the kits. In its December 20, 2019 memo, it says ""these [direct-to-consumer] genetic tests are largely unregulated and could expose personal and genetic information, and potentially create unintended security consequences and increased risk to the joint force and mission,"" Yahoo! News reported.

The memo also says that some DNA kit companies have targeted military personnel with discounts.

Patronis's office recommends three tips to Floridians who are considering using a personal DNA kit.

Beware of ""free"" DNA tests. Always be suspicious of a kit that's offering free genetic testing, especially in exchange for some personal information. It could be a scam .

. Thoroughly read the fine print. Always read the privacy policies so you know what the company issuing the kit is going to do with your personal and genetic information — including whether you are giving them permission to sell your data to a third party. You may be able to opt out.

Learn how to delete your DNA data . Genetic information can reveal personal information about you and your relatives, in addition to your health status. Try not to leave it on the cloud, where it can fall into the wrong hands.

""It’s vital that consumers understand the privacy risks of genetic testing products,"" Patronis said."," Threaten, not specified below",3

16169,ba7d813b831ad5612c70ad431af98764,"OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) – Tribes across the state are taking a stand on the first day of the new year, keeping casinos up and running despite a warning from the governor that in January, the gambling would be illegal.

The 15-year gaming contract was scheduled to expire, and for months now, Governor Stitt told tribal leaders statewide that it’s time to renegotiate the deal. The tribes disagree, contending the compact automatically renews.

The governor warned that if they didn’t negotiate a new deal, Class 3 gaming would no longer be allowed.

Former attorney general Drew Edmondson said many people he knows of agree with the tribes in their reading of the contract. He said he didn’t know what the recourse would be if it turns out the casinos are operating illegally.

“Of they’re not legal, is the state would have trouble accepting the revenue from them, so it’s really in the state’s interest to have those operations continue in effect.”

“It’s all relatively new territory,” said Edmondson, “but it’s a course that needs to be explored and done carefully with a recognition that the state is sovereign, but so are the tribes. They are sovereign, and when there is a disagreement between the two, federal courts become the arbiters.”

That will be the case now that the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations filed a federal lawsuit against Stitt earlier this week.

One thing Edmondson said he believes will come up in litigation is Stitt’s intention to audit the casinos.

“There are items in the compact that give the state the authority to examine the machines, to review the audits that have been done. The question is whether that can be extrapolated into the authority to audit themselves, and that’s where the tribes are saying, no it doesn’t go that far,” Edmondson said.

The expiration of the compact came up during the 2018 election for Oklahoma governor when both Stitt and Edmondson were running against each other.

“We both talked about the compacts coming up and renegotiating the terms and doing things to benefit both the state and the tribes, so we both would have been headed that direction,” Edmondson said. “I think it’s unfortunate that all of this came up in governor Stitt’s first year in office. I think if he’d had a couple of years under his belt and dealt with the tribes a little bit more that it might have been done more gracefully.”

The call — between Stephen Biegun, the U.S. envoy, and Lee Do-hoon, the South Korean envoy — was first reported by South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency, citing an unnamed South Korean official.

According to Yonhap, the call took place to discuss North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s announcement on January 1 that his country may be reconsidering its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons tests, despite the onslaught of punishing sanctions that would likely come as a result.

Kim’s announcement, reported in the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) early Wednesday morning in Pyongyang, followed a rare multi-day meeting — often referred to as a plenum — of North Korea’s senior Workers’ Party leadership.

“The two sides exchanged their assessments of Kim’s remarks made during a four-day meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party Central Committee, and discussed ways of cooperation to denuclearize and bring lasting peace to the Korean Peninsula,” the unnamed official told Yonhap, referring to Biegun and Lee.

Biegun was confirmed late last year as Deputy Secretary of State.

The phone call was held just hours after DPRK state media published its lengthy report on Kim Jong Un’s announcements to the plenum.

According to KCNA, Kim Jong Un said that North Korean citizens going forward will have to “tighten our belts” and independently solve economic problems, because the country should not expect sanctions relief from the Americans anytime soon.

Kim also warned that more weapons may be on their way: he “confirmed that the world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,” KCNA said.

Amid the heated rhetoric, Biegun’s call with Lee Do-hoon is one sign that the Trump administration has not abandoned diplomacy with the North — at least not yet.

Hours earlier, on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump told reporters that he has a “very good relationship” with Kim Jong Un.

Trump added that Kim had signed a “contract” with him about giving up nuclear weapons — a reference to the vague denuclearization commitment both leaders signed when they met for the first time, in Singapore.

Kim “did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement, talking about denuclearization,” Trump said. “And that was signed, number one sentence: denuclearization. That was done in Singapore.”

“And I think he’s a man of his word, so we’re gonna find out,” Trump continued. “But I think he’s a man of his word.”

Kim Jong Un refrained from directly naming or criticizing Trump in his report.

He did, however, include many harsh words for the U.S. as a whole — including a reference to former President George W. Bush’s “Axis of Evil” comment 18 years ago — and it remains to be seen if the supposedly strong personal relationship between the two heads of state will survive the current, growing impasse.

According to KCNA, Kim Jong Un told the party plenum that North Korea would “never trade our state’s security and dignity, or the security of the future for anything.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3
16298,4c0a25afeb2ece16fefec22e7fd1ca2e,"MARSHFIELD — A Marshfield man charged in a high-speed crash that killed a 13-year-old girl and seriously injured two other people has a lengthy history of driving violations, including three license suspensions.

Gregory Goodsell, 31, was arrested Sunday after he crashed his pickup truck into an SUV at Church and Union streets in Pembroke just before 7 a.m., according to a police report filed in Plymouth District Court. Witnesses told police that Goodsell was speeding and ran a red light when he hit the SUV, which had two 13-year-old girls and a 50-year-old woman inside.

All three were initially taken to South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, and the two girls were then taken to Children’s Hospital in Boston, where one of them died.

Authorities have not publicly named the victims, but family friends have said Claire Zisserson died as a result of the crash and Kendall Zemotel suffered serious injuries. Claire Zisserson’s mother, Elizabeth Zisserson, 50, was seriously injured in the crash.

Officers said Goodsell told them that he drank beer and whisky and used cocaine at a company Christmas party before getting behind the wheel of the truck, which had a decal for the company that Goodsell allegedly worked for, Hi-Way Safety Systems, which is headquartered in Rockland. Police said they found a half-empty bottle of whisky and an empty beer can in the truck.

Goodsell was arraigned Monday in Plymouth District Court on charges that included manslaughter, drunken driving and two counts of causing serious injury while recklessly and drunkenly driving. He is being held without bail pending a dangerousness hearing Friday to determine whether he poses a threat to the public.

The state Registry of Motor Vehicles on Monday deemed Goodsell an immediate threat and suspended his driver's license indefinitely.

Goodsell's driving record, provided Tuesday by the agency, shows 13 prior violations and two surchargeable accidents where he was considered at fault dating back to 2006. Violations on Goodsell's record include speeding, failing to stop for police, failing to keep to the right of the road in areas with an obstructed view and a federal motor carrier safety violation.

Goodsell was considered to be at fault in two crashes, in January 2007 and November 2008.

Goodsell also has a dozen sanctions on his driving record, including three license suspensions. His license was suspended from February 2010 to February 2011 for having seven surchargeable events on his record and failing to make payments to the registry. His license was also suspended from January to March 2009 and July to September 2007.

In 2007, Goodsell was required to take a National Safety Council course, which the Registry of Motor Vehicles requires for drivers who have three or more surchargeable events in two years."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
16372,f968233d2f90012066f923699bb5a1bc,"HONG KONG - Hong Kong's celebratory mood on the first day of 2020 was marred by tear gas and water cannons deployed by police on a largely peaceful crowd, and the arrest of some 400 people at a march attended by hundreds of thousands in what has been a months-long anti-government movement.

Senior Superintendent Ng Lok Chun told reporters late Wednesday that police arrested about 400 people during the New Year's Day march on charges including illegal assembly and the possession of offensive weapons. He said police fired tear gas after being surrounded by protesters who were throwing objects at them. He blamed radical protesters for ""hijacking"" and disrupting the march.

The Asian financial hub has been roiled by civil unrest for seven months, and protesters say they will not back down in their demands for universal suffrage and an independent probe into police brutality against the movement that saw nearly 6,500 people arrested. The anti-government movement was sparked by a controversial extradition law that allowed individuals to be sent to China for trial.

Hong Kong's New Year's Eve fireworks display had been canceled for the first time in its 10-year history by officials who cited public safety concerns, but revelers converged nonetheless on the streets of Hong Kong on Tuesday night.

Police deployed a water cannon vehicle to disperse protesters, while armored vehicles cleared roadblocks set up earlier by protesters.

Shortly after midnight, as shouts of ""Happy New Year!"" rang across the city, police in the bustling downtown district of Mongkok fired tear gas at a crowd that set off fireworks and burned roadblocks.

On Wednesday afternoon, hundreds of thousands of people attended an organized demonstration pre-approved by police. The mood at the march, attended by individuals, families and the elderly, was peaceful at the outset. Many chanted slogans, including ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our era!""

The atmosphere turned tense shortly after 5 p.m. local time, when police arrested several people for allegedly vandalizing an HSBC bank in Wanchai district, and angry protesters threw objects and began shouting. Riot police then fired rounds of tear gas, and some protesters retaliated by throwing firebombs.

The organizer of the march, Civil Human Rights Front, called off the demonstration at the request of police, but many protesters remained. Police threatened them with warnings, accusing them of taking part in an illegal assembly. The group later said an estimated 1 million people had taken part in the march.

Later that night, police used water cannons on crowds in Wanchai and the financial hub of Central. Protesters had laid bricks across the main road in Central in an attempt to block police from entering the area. A police statement said protesters blocked roads with barricades, dug up bricks from the pavement, and set fire to banks and ATMs.

The Civil Human Rights Front condemned police for using ""absurd excuses"" to terminate the march and accused them of failing to listen to the people's voices and infringing upon their right of assembly.

""Hong Kongers shall not back down and peace shall not resume with the ongoing police brutality,"" Civil Human Rights Front said in a statement.

Although many Hong Kongers say they remain determined in their fight for democracy under Chinese rule, some are voicing doubts about the effectiveness of the violent confrontations. Others are calling on fellow Hong Kongers to put pressure on the government by boycotting pro-Beijing businesses and joining labor unions for more effective collective actions, such as strikes.

""I don't want to back down, I feel antagonized by the authorities but I am also hoping for a new direction in the movement,"" said an office administrator who joined the march. ""I hope people can also use other means to put pressure on the government."""," Threaten, not specified below",3
16382,7a5c9e840b982811040c840534d3b441,"Radon claims 21,000 lives every year and can be found in the air and water. Radon is a radioactive gas borne from the breakdown of naturally occurring uranium found in rock and soil.

Jan Fisher, national sales manager at Radon Supplies in Flemington, and vice president of Citizens for Radioactive Radon Reduction, said radon is known as the ""silent killer."" It is odorless, tasteless and colorless and can only be detected by specialized tests.

Radon has been classified as a Class A carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency and can affect both humans and animals. Radon is known to cause lung cancer.

Fisher said because radon is a radioactive soil and ground gas, it can enter homes, businesses, schools, daycares and stay trapped inside.

Fisher said someone can breathe in the radon gas and its radon decay products that becomes trapped in a home. Radon can cause DNA damage in a person's lungs, thus causing radon-induced lung cancer. According to the EPA, radon is the top cause of lung cancer among non-smokers and the second leading cause of all forms of lung cancer.

New Jersey daycare centers must test in order to receive their state license and a fact sheet called the ""Interpretation of Radon Testing Results"" must be posted to enable parents to interpret the results.

Radon map from NJDEP

She warned that no home, school or structure is exempt from radon unless it does not touch the ground. Radon is all over the state of New Jersey in three tiers. The state DEP has a 2015 New Jersey Radon Potential Map which can be found at nj.gov/dep/rpp/radon/radonin.htm.

Potential symptoms of radon poisoning may vary and there may not be any symptoms at all, according to radon-induced lung cancer survivors. Gloria Linnertz, founder and director of Citizens for Radioactive Radon Reduction, who lost her husband to the disease, says sometimes symptoms may be hoarseness that doesn't disappear, a nagging cough that lingers, a feeling of fatigue all the time and in rare cases coughing up blood.

Both the U.S. surgeon general and the state Department of Environmental Protection says every home and school in New Jersey should be tested for radon every two years, even if there's an active system in place.

Fisher said it's simple to test for radon yourself. The current ""action level"" is set at 4 picoCuries per liter. The state DEP and the EPA recommend that people take action to mitigate their homes if test results indicate radon levels at 4 pCi/L or higher.

Self-testing for radon is easy. There is a charcoal test canister kit that many New Jersey townships offer for free through a state DEP grant process. The Radon Division has a $1,000 grant on a first-come first-serve basis. This short-term test takes two to six days to complete. Mail the test to a local lab and a person will receive those results within a week.

Another self-test method is an Alpha Track Detector, which monitors radon levels from eight days to one year. This is considered a long-term test.

There are battery powered or electronic monitors that can be used to monitor homes 24/7 but the charcoal test is the most popular and the most affordable.

SEOUL — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared an end to moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon.

Analysts said the announcement, reported by state media on Wednesday, amounted to Kim putting a missile ""to Donald Trump's head"" -- but warned that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Washington was swift to respond, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Kim to ""take a different course"" and stressing that the US wanted ""peace not confrontation"" with the North, while Trump played down the development.

Pyongyang has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out 6 nuclear tests, the last of them 16 times more powerful than the Hiroshima blast, according to the highest estimates.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been a centerpiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and the US president, but little tangible progress.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's ""promise"" to him not to carry them out, and has downplayed launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February. The North set the US an end-of-2019 deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a ""new way"".

""There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,"" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim as telling top ruling party officials.

""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" he added, referring to the North by its official name.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party was an indication of a major policy shift.

State television showed veteran newsreader Ri Chun Hee reading out the KCNA dispatch over footage of Kim addressing the officials and general imagery of the country.

The broadcast appeared to stand in place of Kim's usual New Year speech -- normally a key moment in the North Korean political calendar.

Kim acknowledged the impact of international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programs, but made clear that the North was willing to pay the price to preserve its nuclear capability.

""The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,"" KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had ""conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop"" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said.

'GEOPOLITCAL CHICKEN'

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, while Washington has insisted it take more tangible steps towards giving them up.

""North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump's head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,"" said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

""Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,"" he added.

The strategy was risky, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with ""more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account"".

Kim's moratorium comments were ""ominous"", said Leif-Eric Easley of Ewha University in Seoul, but added that he could be looking to ""elicit concessions by approaching Trump's red line without crossing it"".

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carries out a long-range missile test.

Speaking to Fox News and CBS after Kim's announcement, Pompeo said a resumption of nuclear and missile tests would be ""deeply disappointing"".

""We hope that Chairman Kim will take a different course... that he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,"" Pompeo said.

""We want peace, not confrontation,"" he added, with Seoul's unification ministry adding that a strategic weapon test ""would not help denuclearization negotiations"".

Trump himself was emollient, saying that he thought Kim was ""a man of his word"" and that at their Singapore summit, ""we did sign a contract, talking about denuclearization"".

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern over North Korea's announcement and ""very much hopes that the tests will not resume,"" his spokesman said.

""Non-proliferation remains a fundamental pillar of global nuclear security,"" he added.

An ICBM launch would be likely to frustrate China, the North's key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own back yard.

LAKEWOOD, Colo. — The woman who was stabbed to death on New Year's Day suffered more than a dozen stab and cut wounds, according to an arrest affidavit for her boyfriend from the Lakewood Police Department (LPD).

The victim, identified as 49-year-old Keli Jackson, also had swelling and bruising around both of her eyes, the document says.

Her boyfriend, 52-year-old Stephen DeRossett, was arrested and is being held without bond at the Jefferson County Jail on charges of first-degree murder and domestic violence.

LPD said officers were called to the 2500 block of South Cody Way just before 11:30 a.m. on Jan. 1.

When they arrived, they found Jackson suffering from multiple stab wounds, police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

DeRossett was the one who called LPD to the home. He initially said a woman had come at him with a knife but that he was able to take it away and restrain her, the arrest affidavit says.

He identified the woman as Jackson, and said she was ""highly intoxicated"" and had ""started acting weird after taking shots,"" according to the affidavit.

DeRossett said Jackson, whom he'd been dating for about seven months, ""began swinging"" at him and he ""defended himself."" He said Jackson then grabbed the knife.

Officers noticed a scrape on his knee, scratches on his face and a cut on his right hand near his pinky finger, according to the affidavit.

He said, according to the affidavit, that Jackson hit him ""multiple times in the head and face area"" and that he was ""just defending himself"" and that he ""did not know what happened next.""

Civil servants have been warned that they are “woefully unprepared” for the sweeping reforms of Whitehall being prepared by the prime minister and his special adviser, Dominic Cummings.

Officials could be made to take regular exams to prove that they are up to their Whitehall jobs under “seismic” changes being planned by No 10, Rachel Wolf, who helped draw up Boris Johnson’s election-winning manifesto, has said.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Wolf said reported plans for merging, creating or abolishing departments were just a “tiny fraction” of the changes set to be implemented.

Wolf said the changes, set to begin in the spring, after the UK’s due date for leaving the EU, would end the “merry-go-round” of officials changing jobs every 18 months. But she dismissed suggestions that the civil service would be “politicised” under the reforms that Cummings is likely to have a big influence over.

Wolf said Johnson wanted to run “the most dynamic state in the world”. She added that one of the biggest changes was likely to be in the area of Whitehall recruitment and training.

Wolf stated that anyone staying in the same job for longer than 18 months is currently seen to have “stalled” in a culture that ensures “everyone rises to their position of incompetence”. She also predicts that civil servants will be “reoriented to the public” rather than “stakeholders”.

In an interview with the Daily Express, he claimed that organizations that are studying the use of autonomous weapons systems in conflicts say that using AI in these circumstances is a bad idea. “The positives of doing it are so small compared to the huge stack of negatives, so really we shouldn’t be doing this”, Walker cited the organizations as saying.

Alex Jones calls out President Trump for not protecting his vocal support base, effectively helping Dems gain ground in the 2020 election.

He said that the international community should treat this technology the same way it treats other dangerous technologies that people resort to in desperate situations. “We don’t allow people to use chemical weapons in war, we don’t allow people to use biological weapons and the use of land mines and cluster mines is heavily regulated or controlled”, Walker explained.

He confessed that he is against the American model of testing weapons, which he described as “let us see what goes wrong and what we can do about this”. “Overall with AI and warfare, we can see some of the things that could go wrong so let us stop them from ever happening if we can”, Walker said.

In September, Microsoft President Brad Smith said that the world needs a global convention on the use of autonomous weapons systems and stressed that robots should “not be allowed to decide on their own to engage in combat and who to kill”.

16676,67866ea31781fa6ef761943167d45baf,"Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen speaks during a graduation ceremony for Investigation Bureau agents in New Taipei City, Dec. 26, 2019.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday that the democratic island would only deal with China on an equal footing, and would continue to insist on its freedom, democracy and sovereignty in the face of a growing threat from Beijing.

In her 2020 New Year's Address on Jan. 1, Tsai called on China to recognize the existence of the Republic of China, founded by the Kuomintang (KMT) nationalist party after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 and relocated to Taiwan after Chiang Kai-shek lost the civil war to Mao Zedong's communists in 1949.

She said China has used diplomatic offensives, military threats, interference and infiltration to try to force the island to compromise its sovereignty.

But Tsai said Taiwan would never agree to becoming part of the People's Republic of China in its current, authoritarian state.

""Democracy and authoritarianism cannot coexist within the same country,"" Tsai said.

""Hong Kong's people have shown us that 'one country, two systems' is absolutely not viable,"" she said, in a reference to the separate legal framework and maintenance of traditional freedoms promised to Hong Kong ahead of the 1997 handover, a distinction that has been gradually eroding in the face of political pressure from Beijing.

""China must face the reality of the Republic of China's existence, ... respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy, and handle cross-strait differences peacefully, on a basis of equality,"" she said.

""We must be aware that China is infiltrating all facets of Taiwanese society to sow division,"" Tsai warned. ""We must establish democratic defense mechanisms to prevent infiltration.""

She said the Anti-Infiltration Law passed by Taiwan's Legislative Yuan on Tuesday was aimed at protecting its freedom and democracy, not hampering genuine economic and cultural exchange across the Taiwan Strait.

""Taiwan's democracy and freedom cannot be undermined,"" Tsai said.

China stepping up 'United Front' work

The Anti-Infiltration Law was passed following repeated warnings from Taiwan's national security agencies that China is pouring in backdoor resources and stepping up ""United Front"" propaganda work to boost support for the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), or nationalist party ahead of the Jan. 11 general election.

The new law forbids any organizations or individuals sponsored by foreign powers from providing political contributions, campaigning, lobbying, or disseminating fake news meant to interfere in elections.

Lawmakers in the U.S. and Australia have enacted similar legislation to prevent foreign interference and to monitor foreign influence.

The bill, which passed by 67 votes to zero despite opposition criticism, was fast-tracked by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after the KMT nominated at-large candidates for the legislature with close ties to China's Communist Party, including retired Taiwan generals.

Professor Tung Li-wen of the Asia-Pacific Elite Interchange Association said Tsai's tougher line on Beijing had come after Chinese President Xi Jinping's Jan. 2, 2019 speech insisting that Taiwan ""unify"" with China under ""one country, two systems,"" and refusing to rule out the use of force to annex the country.

""I think Tsai Ing-wen is very disappointed in Beijing and in Xi Jinping,"" Tung said. ""Back in the 2016 election, Tsai was talking about preserving the status quo in cross-straits relations, and was hoping for dialogue with Beijing.""

He said her hand had been forced by the uncompromising tone of Xi's Jan. 2 ""Letter to our Taiwan Compatriots"" speech.

""This made Tsai Ing-wen feel that there was no way to back down, and that she had to state Taiwan's bottom line very clearly,"" Tung said.

""[Her speech] comes against this background.""

Tsai looks set to win a second term when the country goes to the polls on Jan. 11.

Media control

Prosecutors in December detained 10 people, including a former KMT staffer, on suspicion of falsifying documents to bring thousands of mainland Chinese to Taiwan, possibly including some who were collecting intelligence.

Concerns have also been raised about Beijing's influence over Taiwanese media groups, many of which are owned by corporations with ties to China.

Support for the KMT, the party that fled to Taiwan after losing control of China in 1949 and still wants it to be part of a ""unified""

China some day, is at a new low ahead of next month's election.

The Global Views Research annual public opinion survey said the violent suppression of Hong Kong's anti-government protests had sparked growing fears for Taiwan's national security and democracy, although an internal power struggle in the party had contributed.

Currently, only 4.5 percent of Taiwanese support the idea of ""unification"" with China.

Tsai has been a vocal supporter of Hong Kong protesters' aspirations for full democracy, and against the use of police violence and political prosecutions to target protesters, and told a recent presidential election debate that China is the biggest threat to Taiwan's way of life.

Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was handed back to the 1911 Republic of China under the KMT as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal.

It has never been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, nor formed part of the People's Republic of China.

Taiwan began a transition to democracy following the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.

On December 10, 2019, Breitbart News reported that Northam changed his position from supporting an across-the-board ban on possession of such weapons to supporting a ban only in a situation where a person refuses to register the firearm with the government. The Virginia Mercury quoted Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky saying, “The governor’s assault weapons ban will include a grandfather clause for individuals who already own assault weapons, with the requirement they register their weapons before the end of a designated grace period.”

But gun owners in Virginia had better not buy Northam’s new, softer rhetoric. It means the same thing in the end.

Don’t take my word for it, though. Economist Walter Williams writes,

I’d urge Virginians not to fall for the registration trick. Knowing who owns what weapons is the first step to confiscation.

Williams continues,

James Madison, in Federalist Paper No. 46 wrote that the Constitution preserves “the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation … (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.” Thomas Jefferson wrote: “What country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms.” Too many Americans believe the Second Amendment grants Americans the right to own firearms only to go hunting and for self-protection. The framers of our Constitution had no such intent in mind.

Williams, like the founding fathers before us, has it right. Virginians had better be ready to defend their gun rights because an unarmed populace is a populace ripe for more abuse and control by the government."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Over the last 18 months, Donald Trump has picked a fight with Iran that he won’t end and can’t win. That fight has had horrifying consequences for the Iranian people, led Tehran to restart its nuclear program, and now left parts of the American embassy compound in Baghdad in flames. In the days and weeks to come, Trump’s policy will likely lead either to war or additional American humiliation, or both.

The fight began in May 2018 when the Trump administration left the Iran nuclear deal, and intensified last spring, when the United States designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization and moved to shut off Iran’s ability to export oil. Numerous observers warned that Iran would meet America’s escalation with escalation of its own. The Revolutionary Guard Corps designation, The New York Times reported last April, “was opposed by some top Trump administration national security officials who said it could incite retaliation by Tehran against American troops and intelligence officers.” The following month, the Times added that “[i]n private meetings, military officials have warned the White House that its maximum-pressure campaign against Iran is motivating…threats to United States troops and American interests in the Middle East.” In The Atlantic that same month, Mike Giglio noted, “The militia groups that act as Iranian proxies in Iraq…would be an effective tool for further [Iranian] escalation” against the US.

These predictions have proven correct. In May, the United States accused Iran of attacking oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. Then, in June, Iran shot down an American drone.

Iran’s escalation left the Trump administration in a quandary. The president likes grand diplomatic gestures. But his administration’s withdrawal from the Iran deal—combined with its absurdly maximalist demand that, as a condition for any future nuclear agreement, Iran entirely capitulate to Saudi Arabia in the two countries’ contest for regional influence—has made a diplomatic solution to the crisis virtually impossible. In June, Trump’s then-national security adviser, John Bolton, argued for meeting Iran’s provocations with force. But Trump, convinced that his supporters want no more Middle Eastern wars, called off an attack aimed at punishing Iran for the drone strike. The attack on the drone didn’t kill any Americans, Trump explained. If it had, that would have made “a big, big difference.”

In backing down, he thus established a red line. And last week, Iran’s proxies crossed it. An Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, Kataib Hezbollah, fired on an Iraqi military base, wounding four American servicemen and killing an American contractor. This time, the Trump administration did respond with force: On Sunday, it launched airstrikes against the militia’s forces in Iraq and Syria, killing 24 people and wounding 50.

Watch: Trump Threatens Iran Over US Embassy In Iraq (GeoBeats)

But if Trump’s non-response made America look weak in June, his military response on Sunday set off a chain of events that has made America look even weaker. On Tuesday, following funeral services for the dead militiamen, thousands of supporters of Kataib Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian militias stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, shouting “death to America.” Outraged by the U.S. attacks, many of Iraq’s top clerics and politicians are now demanding the withdrawal of all American troops. On Tuesday, Abbas Kadhim, director of the Iraq initiative at the Atlantic Council tweeted that, “I expect the days of the large American diplomatic & business presence in Iraq to be numbered.” Liz Sly, The Washington Post’s bureau chief in Beirut, predicted an endgame reminiscent of Saigon in 1975. “After today,” she tweeted, “how do the Americans trapped inside the embassy leave except by helicopter?”

Trump, as is his wont, has responded with bluster: “Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,” he tweeted on Tuesday, “They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.” The Pentagon announced plans to send in reinforcements. But with each escalation, Trump’s predicament worsens. His confidantes insist he can’t afford a war—which would likely boost oil prices and damage the economy—especially in an election year. Yet he also can’t pursue real diplomacy, at least not without provoking a confrontation with the GOP’s hawkish foreign policy elite. He’s caught between his desire to avoid being like George W. Bush and his desire to avoid being like Barack Obama.

So, absent a revolution that replaces the Islamic Republic with a more pliant regime, he’s at Iran’s mercy. Given the crushing sanctions America continues to impose, Iran has every incentive to make America bleed. Its proxy armies offer it numerous opportunities to do so. And every time it does, it offers Trump the unenviable choice of launching a potentially catastrophic third Middle Eastern war or being exposed as a paper tiger.

When it comes to Iran, Trump has shifted Republican foreign policy away from war without shifting it towards diplomacy—the only stable alternative to war. So he’s caught in a kind of purgatory. The American embassy compound in Baghdad, now covered in pro-Iranian graffiti and strewn with broken glass, is the latest symbol of that purgatory. It probably won’t be the last.

16929,c704a3975044e1eb5575a1050f567a66,"HEALTH MINISTER Simon Harris was warned that women feel like ‘second class citizens’ over the way they have been treated while living with endometriosis.

Women reported feeling suicidal, having their motives questioned when they reported symptoms to a doctor, and a failure to receive adequate treatment at a huge risk to their fertility, according to correspondence sent to the Fine Gael TD over the past year.

Around 155,000 women and girls of all ages are suffering with endometriosis in Ireland.

The chronic condition affects one in 10 women, but women say a lack of awareness in the area among medical professionals, and a lack of interest at political levels, has seen women wait upwards of nine years for diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

Endometriosis involves cells beginning to grow outside of the uterus, with an immune response that causes swelling and severe abdominal pain.

Women report being repeatedly misdiagnosed with other bowel and gastrointestinal conditions by GPs, and in many cases report having their symptoms dismissed as “period pain” or “women’s problems”.

Documents obtained by TheJournal.ie under Freedom of Information legislation show more than a dozen women have pleaded with Harris for better treatment and awareness of the debilitating disease which can affect women and girls from as young as 10 or 11 years old.

One woman, who contacted Harris directly in February, said she felt like a second class citizen and said she attempted suicide as a result of the debilitating mental and physical toll the disease has taken on her.

She described the “immense pain” she experiences daily and the ineffectiveness of the painkillers she has been taking to reduce the pain.

In a previous interview with TheJournal.ie, 27-year-old Aimee Brown also spoke candidly of “the suicidal crisis” she faced while dealing with the mental and physical toll that endometriosis takes.

She described waiting for 10 years for a diagnosis, being forced to travel for treatment, and being dismissed by medical professionals in Ireland.

Inhumane

In another email to Harris, one woman gave an account of how doctors told her “that this is something girls during puberty have to deal with” when she first described the symptoms she was experiencing.

She told Harris how “she couldn’t stand with the pain” and that medication prescribed to her didn’t work.

Her GP questioned whether she was “possibly seeking attention, looking to miss school”.

Following surgeries, doctors repeatedly said they found no evidence of endometriosis.

“I remember breaking down in the hospital bed to my mam because I couldn’t understand where the pain was coming from.

“The pain I felt was very real and yet every medical professional, the ones we’re supposed to trust, was telling me there was no reason for my pain. My pain was apparently all in my head.”

Following an emergency surgery to investigate her symptoms at a later stage, a doctor asked her “things like ‘how are things at home?’” and “‘are you having trouble in your relationship?’”, questions she felt were irrelevant to her symptoms.

In October, a woman gave an account of the “horrendous pain and muscular cramping” she lives with on “a daily basis”.

“We want to pose to you the question regarding the lack of care and treatment towards women’s health care in Ireland, compared to other EU countries. It is shocking and quite frankly, inhumane,” she said.

Speaking of her friend’s experience of the disease, she said: “We, as humans, deserve to live a happy, healthy life” but the “lack of education, care interest and awareness surrounding endometriosis in Ireland has left us both [with] a potential infertile adulthood”.

Correspondence released to TheJournal.ie was heavily redacted, with all personal information, including names, address and identifying details removed in line with the Freedom of Information guidelines.

Messes with your head

Shauna Conroy, from Dublin, who spoke to TheJournal.ie about her experience seeking help and support for endometriosis, said it was frustrating being misdiagnosed while endometriosis was given little consideration by medical professionals.

“There was a nurse… and she said to the doctor do you think it might be endometriosis and she said that word, and I remember saying ‘oh, I actually have that in my family’.

“My aunties have it, my cousins have it. I knew my aunties could never have children and I said there is a family history but after that they never went that route and it was all gastro,” the 27-year-old said.

She moved from one GP to another and saw several different consultant doctors for a variety of conditions over a two-year period.

“They thought appendicitis, Crohn’s, they said there could be something on my colon when they were going down the cancer route. They throw these phrases out willy-nilly and then you’re not seeing another doctor for months so you’re left with this in your head,” she said.

I genuinely thought that I was going to need a kidney donation because they were saying now we see something on your kidneys, and psychologically that messes with your head.

“And physically you’re just wrecked from all the tests and scopes, and prodding and poking,” she added.

During this time, and despite going through a process of elimination to rule out other diseases, Shauna repeatedly told doctors she thought it might be endometriosis as other family members had it but she felt she wasn’t taken seriously.

“I was rushed to A&E with severe bleeding and was in overnight. And then they said to me, we think it’s your appendix, again. I literally said to them ‘do you not have my file?’. Chapter two of it will tell you we ruled out the appendix.

“After about 12 hours of telling them everything, they said ‘oh, it probably is endometriosis’ and said you have to wait for surgery, and they sent me home with a box of laxatives.”

“And I get that they’re not going to say there and then, ‘here’s a magic pill’ but you just feel like you’re cattle and I mean, you’re severely bleeding and you think something is damaged.

“You think what if it happens again, and you sit at home telling yourself it’s fine. That happened one of my aunties, she started hemorrhaging and they rushed her in and did an emergency hysterectomy, so that’s what you have in the background.”

Campaigners have been calling for a dedicated centre of excellence to be set up in Ireland with teams of specialist consultants put in place to improve the shortcomings in treatment of the condition.

They also want better education and training of medical professionals in this area.

Asked what the Health Minister is doing to support the 155,000 women with the condition, a spokesperson said the Women’s Task Force will consider endometriosis and how it is treated, and recommendations from that task force will be taken into account.

“It is important to state, the Minister is guided by the advice from the HSE’s National Women & Infants Health Programme. Its advice is that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services,” they said.

In December, advocates and patients living with the condition appeared before TDs and senators in Leinster House to appeal for better investment and awareness in the disease."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Ms Barber, whose own son died of a heroin overdose years ago, had apparently been trying to help Micah with his drug problem since 2014.

He is thought to have been prescribed 'two different benzodiazepines' to treat a heroin addiction, which Ms Barber did not believe was the right course of action.

'There has to be a better way to cope with anxiety and depression for those addicted to heroin,' she said. 'Micah will never be forgotten and deeply missed. Prayers for his family.'

Micah and Milly had cut ties after filming Bride and Prejudice. Following their break-up, Micah moved back to California, where his family lives.

The pair went on Bride and Prejudice to repair their troubled relationship, but they split before walking down the aisle.

Milly called off her wedding during an episode that aired in November, after revealing she was worried his use of alcohol and marijuana would be a bad influence on their son, Julian.

'And I thought he had. I'm so sad because I don't want Julian to grow up to be like that. He just doesn't need a role model like that.'

Footage also resurfaced this week of the haunting moment on Bride and Prejudice when Milly's mother, Catherine Johnson, warned her daughter that Micah was on a path of self-destruction.

Yet soon after our Whistleblower story aired, Bonnie Burch received good news that a car she never thought she'd get back was found by one of our viewers.

“It was a possibility it was my car, she wasn't 100 percent sure,” Burch said.

Burch said her daughter received a Facebook message that her car was parked outside an apartment building in West Fargo. Details of how the car ended up there are still murky.

“I was excited, scared because I didn't know the condition that it was in. I was in a hurry to get there to see,” Burch said.

She has an anti-lock device around her steering wheel now and she's not taking any chances.

“I'm trying to secure it where they can't get it or steal it again,” Burch said.

Her 2013 dark grey Toyota Corolla was originally parked in the garage at her apartment building located along 42nd St S.

West Fargo police recovered the vehicle for her and Fargo police officers seized evidence found inside the car. She’s thankful for the officers.

“It was hard when they stole it because I didn't have a way to get around, but now I do, and I'm glad to have it back,” Burch said.

The car didn't have any damages besides the front license plate being taken off and the gas was at the same level as how she remembers she left it.

The manager of her apartment building told her between eight to nine garages were burglarized at the time her vehicle was stolen.

“I want to thank the person who found it and suspected it was mine,” Burch said.

Although Burch got her car back, she still wants the perpetrators to be punished for the theft."," Threaten, not specified below",3

For those who aren’t familiar with the concept, eminent domain is a process that allows the government to seize property for public use. In effect, the government takes the property but also pays the owner fair market value for the land. The reasonable use of eminent domain can make sense for projects that serve the public good like building a new road, or constructing a new school. However, we have also seen eminent domain abused for projects that benefit a private company, or simply don’t provide the level of public good that can justify the taking of land from our citizens.

This project would allow an out-of-state private company to utilize eminent domain to seize land in eight counties across Missouri, including Buchanan County, in order to build a power line that would transmit energy to parts of our state, but primarily to customers outside our borders. The bottom line is the project would cause Missouri citizens to lose their land so a private company could increase its profits. As someone who cares deeply about your property rights, I gave my full support to legislation that would prevent the use of eminent domain for this project.

For the 2020 session I have already filed HB 1412 to give property owners the help they need to fight back against those who seek to take their property. It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that it can be incredibly costly for a private landowner to try to fight back against an effort to condemn their property or take it by eminent domain. My bill would ensure the authority trying to condemn or seize the property has to reimburse the property owner for his or her attorney’s fees. With this we can give the little guy a fighting chance against the big company or government that wants to take away his property.

When talking about Grain Belt Express, or any eminent domain project, the thing that cannot and should not be lost in this discussion is the impact decisions like these can have on the lives of Missourians. What sounds like a worthwhile project to one person can result in the loss of a family home for another. For anyone who has worked hard to buy a home or a piece of land, it’s terrifying to think all of that work can be undone by the decisions of government bureaucrats.

This is why I will not rest in my fight to protect the rights of property owners. Eminent domain is an incredibly powerful tool that should be used rarely and only in circumstances where the public good will be served. All Missourians should understand that even the threat of eminent domain is powerful enough to get land owners to sell their land or at a price lower than they deserve.

New legislation temporarily prevents the US Air Force from using LRIP F-35A aircraft as aggressor aircraft

The service wants to use them to accurately replicate fifth-generation threats that it will see from Chinese and Russian fighters

The US has temporarily halted the US Air Force's (USAF) plan to use Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) conventional variant low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft for aggressor squad training until the service provides further details to Congress.

The fiscal year 2020 (FY 2020) National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law on 20 December, said the service cannot use these aircraft for aggressor squad training until the chief of staff, currently General David Goldfein, submits to lawmakers a comprehensive plan and report on the strategy for modernising its organic aggressor fleet.

This plan must include: potential locations for F-35A aggressor aircraft, including analysis of installations that have the size and availability of airspace necessary to meet flying operations requirements. It must also analyse installations that have sufficient capacity and availability of range space, are capable of hosting advanced threat training exercises, and meet or require minimal addition to the environmental requirements associated with the basing action.

The report must also examine the potential cost and benefits of expanding aggressor squadrons currently operating 18 primary assigned aircraft (PAA) to a level of 24 aircraft. Congress also wants an analysis of the cost and timelines associated with modernising the current USAF aggressor squadrons to include upgrading aircraft radar, infrared search and track (IRST) systems, radar warning receiver, tactical datalink, threat-representative jamming pods, and other upgrades necessary to provide a realistic advanced adversary threat.

Congress supports the USAF having access to an advanced adversary force prior to foreign powers such as China and Russia fielding a fifth-generation operational capability.

17264,b748b52ce08b7c8310ff860a5634a9e3,"Want To Ban New Gas & Diesel Cars? Look To Sweden To See How It’s Done





January 1st, 2020 by Carolyn Fortuna

What would it take for a country to ban new gasoline and diesel cars? Look no farther than the government of Sweden, which is in the midst of a study to offer proposals on just such a topic.

The inquiry is to:

Analyze the conditions for introducing a national ban on sales of new gasoline and diesel cars

Determine how to exempt vehicles that run on renewable fuels and electric hybrid vehicles from such a ban

Deconstruct how to bring about an EU-wide ban on sales of new gasoline and diesel cars and the phasing out of fossil fuels in the EU

Make the necessary legislative proposals, albeit not in the area of taxation, where the inquiry may only analyse measures and conduct impact analyses

Propose a year by which fossil fuels should be phased out in Sweden, and the measures needed for this to happen in the most cost-effective manner possible

“Sweden will be the world’s first fossil-free welfare nation. The transport sector is responsible for a third of Sweden’s emissions of greenhouse gases, and thus has a significant role to play in the climate transition,” says Per Bolund, minister for financial markets and housing.

In December, 2019, the Swedish government presented a climate policy action plan to the Riksdag. The goal was to have climate as an integrated element of all relevant policy areas. The government bill, with its 132 measures, takes a holistic approach to how emissions will be reduced throughout Swedish society. Environmental policy in Sweden concerns the creation of:

A society free of emissions and hazardous toxins, with consideration for people, animals and nature

A sustainable society that is adapted to climate change











Isabella Lövin, minister for environment and climate, explained:

“The climate emergency is a serious threat to global prosperity and security if we do not end our dependence on fossil fuels and build environmentally sustainable societies. Ignoring scientists’ repeated warnings would be completely irresponsible. Sweden can lead the way and show that a fossil-free world is not only possible but can also promote our prosperity and our companies. In a unique move, Sweden is moving forward with an action plan and the fundamental approach that consideration of the climate must be incorporated into everything we do in society.”

The inquiry’s terms of reference are grounded in the “January Agreement,” which is the policy agreement between the Swedish Social Democratic Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal Party, and the Green Party. There are 73 total points to the January Agreement, which contains a large number of concessions by the government on socioeconomic issues.

The Swedish government is attempting to exert greater efforts to integrate climate policy into all relevant policy areas, so that Sweden will have net zero atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 at the latest. That will take serious consideration, as it will require reviewing all relevant legislation to ensure that the climate policy framework has an intended impact.

Because Sweden’s national philosophy looks to many environmental issues and their global nature, a large part of its climate policy action planning takes place in collaboration with other countries.

The final report is to be presented by 01 February 2021.

Hundreds of people stood in line for more than six hours Wednesday, awaiting the opening of Sunnyside Lakeview Dispensary in Chicago.

Several shelled out more than $100--cash only--for all sorts of products. Most customers bought items you can smoke or eat.

Illinois residents can go to their houses and consume, but people who live in Wisconsin aren't allowed to bring it home. Marijuana is still considered illegal in Wisconsin.

Some people in line said they planned ahead to follow the law in both states.

""Nobody's driving,"" said Mitchell Russ from Racine. ""We took the train, and we're going to take the train back tomorrow,"" Russ said.

People from out of state can buy half of what an Illinois resident can. That's up to 15 grams of marijuana per day or 250 milligrams of the active ingredient in edibles.

Workers behind the counter are willing to educate people on what they are buying.

""I'm excited,"" said Nancy O'Brien of Chicago. ""My son's been wanting me to try it but I refused. So now I'm starting the new year off right,"" she said.

USUALLY reserved for Easter time, hot cross buns are now a year-round favourite.

And the Old Fernvale Bakery has already jumped on the trend before the big retailers, according to owner Bill Rose.

""We did a survey within our business about two months ago … a high percentage of people wanted hot cross buns,"" he said.

""I know we're going to be off-side with some and that's unfortunate but we're trying to survive in a town of 2800 with 40 staff working for me.""

Mr Rose said times were tougher than ever, especially for country folk.

Costco, Coles and Woolworths also have their part to play, Mr Rose said.

""We can't sit back and watch Costco in its honeymoon period - Coles, Woolworths, they're all selling hot cross buns,"" he said.

To compete, the bakery is offering a smorgasbord of flavours - at least 25 varieties - not including their usual gourmet offerings.

Varieties will include pina colada, Turkish delight, jam doughnut, mocha, jaffa, toffee apple, musk, Nutella, Golden Gaytime, cookies and cream, with more to come.

Hot cross buns are available now and the bakery will take special orders for gourmet buns at Easter time.

AT THE Old Fernvale Bakery there's more than 100 years of baking experience.

But no star shines brighter than Tyler Casanovis, who was the winner of Excellence in Baking, Patisserie in Queensland earlier this year.

His boss, Bill Rose, said he was beaten in the national titles in Melbourne by only one point.

""We've got Bradley (in the bakery too), between the boys they won 37 medals in national and state competitions this year,"" he said.

Among those titles, the bakery took out the Best Gourmet Pie in the Great Aussie Pie competition at the Fine Foods Festival in Sydney, earlier this year.

Mr Rose said the secret to the bakery's success comes in quality ingredients despite rising costs in the industry and the mass commercialisation of the industry.

""A lot of prices are going up, some companies can import (ingredients) for cheaper,"" Mr Rose said.

17412,23b8237c82e619c3a544482167e65d44,"Stand up and be counted. In Minnesota, that looks like a daunting challenge for the 2020 census. In many other states, a fair tally seems more like a dare than a promise.

The Census Bureau requires some 8,000 temporary workers to pull off the decennial head count across Minnesota. To get there, officials had expected to sift through 38,000 applications by the end of January.

So far, only about a third of that number have applied, despite pay of up to $27.50 an hour in Hennepin County. The culprit: The strongest job market in years for people looking elsewhere for permanent full-time jobs.

“At some point the census can’t … progress if we don’t have people to do this work. So to me it’s really serious,” state demographer Susan Brower told the Star Tribune. “Any barriers that are brought about because of a lack of people to do this work is going to have a serious impact on the census overall.”

Even before the hiring problem emerged, the Urban Institute warned that Minnesota — a state with a projected population of more than 5.7 million — could miss as many as 29,500 people in the decennial count.

If so, an undercount here would be happenstance. In other parts of the country, overlooking residents appears to be more by design.

In states largely led by Democrats, governments are spending extra money to give the census a better chance of counting every last soul living within their borders. California and 25 other states have earmarked an unprecedented sum — almost a third of a billion — to supplement census count efforts with everything from door-to-door pamphleteering to sophisticated advertising and market campaigns.

Thanks to Democratic prodding, some $1.4 billion in census funds cut by the Trump White House were restored to the federal budget in a December agreement.

Encouraging an accurate count means big money. The federal government apportions about $675 billion for schools, roads, hospitals and other public works with the aid of census numbers. How many seats a state can claim in the U.S. House, as well as Electoral College votes, relies on the same figures, and Brower said this week that she’s “less confident” Minnesota can hang on to its eight seats based on new projections, although it’s not “impossible.”

“Red states,” nevertheless, are largely shunning any effort to encourage a complete census head count, the New York Times reported. “The political divide is stark: Seventeen of those 24 are led by Republican governors and legislatures, including population heavyweights like Texas, Florida and Ohio. But of the 26 states that are spending money, only four are Republican-controlled.”

Republicans appear fearful which hard-to-reach residents might be found by the census — immigrants, legal or illegal, minorities and millions of poor people who live on the fringes of society.

It may sound unfair to charge Republicans with discouraging a census count that would give states with big cities a greater voice in Congress — and in state legislatures. But consider other hurdles Trump and his allies have placed before the 2020 census. White House attempts to pare the census budget. The census director’s job unfilled for more than a year in the run-up to the count. A failed attempt to add a “citizenship question” to the census, which likely would have discouraged cooperation from Latinos and other immigrants.

Boosting the census count in Minnesota should be a duty, even if politicians in other states ignore that call."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The decision comes a day after the announcement that more than 30 correctional academy trainees were fired over giving a Nazi salute in a class photo.

The regional Anti-Defamation League chapter will draft the training materials and coursework, The Associated Press reported Tuesday, citing a spokesman for the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety.

The photo of dozens of participants in the basic training class making the Nazi salute reads “Hail Byrd!” at the top, a reference to their correctional academy instructor, Karrie Byrd.

According to a report by state investigators, the trainees regularly gave the Nazi salute “as a sign of respect” for their instructor in the weeks prior to the release of the photo.

Byrd told investigators that she was unaware of the “historical or racial implications of the gesture” and said it was “simply a greeting,” according to the report, NBC News reported . Other sources for the report contradicted her statements.

“The investigation disclosed that she encouraged it, reveled in it, and at times reciprocated the gesture,” the report said.

Two correctional academy trainers and a cadet from the class shown in the picture were fired when the photo came to light in early December.

17742,9ff2088e25f2386a28f1f11deb02532f,"OTTAWA - The Trudeau government has long characterized it as a dispassionate policy exercise drawing on expert evidence.

But the political drumbeats are growing louder — at home and abroad — as the federal Liberals come closer to deciding whether to let a Chinese telecom firm help build Canada's next-generation mobile networks.

The development of 5G, or fifth-generation, networks will give people speedier connections and provide vast data capacity to meet the ceaseless demand for emerging applications, like virtual reality and autonomous driving, as more and more things link to the internet.

In Canada, China-based Huawei Technologies, Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are among the leading candidates to help telecommunication firms such as BCE and Telus build their 5G networks.

The opposition Conservatives are pressing the Liberals to deny Huawei a role in assembling the country's 5G infrastructure, alleging it will allow Beijing to spy on Canadians more easily.

Some security experts say Huawei's participation could give it access to an array of digital data gleaned from how, when and where Canadian customers use their electronic devices. In turn, the theory goes, Chinese security agencies could pressure the company into handing over the personal information.

Such fears stem from the fact China’s National Intelligence Law plainly states that Chinese organizations and citizens shall support, assist and co-operate with state intelligence work.

At a forum in Halifax last November, Donald Trump's national security adviser urged Ottawa to bar Huawei from 5G efforts because the technology would be used as a ""Trojan horse"" to undermine Canada.

The warning came a day after China's ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, dismissed the notion Huawei could compromise users' security by installing ""back-door"" channels in equipment, calling it a ""groundless accusation.""

Huawei emphasizes it is not a state-controlled enterprise and that it would never do the bidding of spymasters from China or any other country.

Benjamin Howes, a Huawei Canada vice-president for international media affairs, notes the company's involvement in Canada's existing 4G networks has never led to any such security incident.

He points to Huawei's $650-million investment in research and development in Canada since 2009, with major labs in Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, Ont., Montreal and Vancouver, as well as plans for one in Quebec City.

""In every country where we have a business presence, we're committed to complying with the applicable laws and regulations, and Canada is no different,"" Howes said. ""So we will continue to be compliant, as we have been over the decade that we've been here, with Canadian laws and regulations.""

Ottawa is carrying out a comprehensive review of Huawei’s potential role in 5G that includes a broader, strategic look at how the technology can foster economic growth.

Given the scope of the review, several agencies — namely Public Safety Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Communications Security Establishment, Global Affairs, and Innovation, Science and Economic Development — are taking part.

""We will ensure that our networks are kept secure and will take the appropriate decisions in due course,"" said Scott Bardsley, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.

The government has been tight-lipped about the exercise, but the results are expected relatively soon.

""We respect the process, and we just hope that it's going to be based on technology and security, not politics,"" Howes said.

However, the public debate has already been tinged by political developments.

Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei executive, in December 2018 at the request of the United States, where she is wanted over allegations of violating sanctions on Iran. Her extradition case is before a Canadian court.

The move angered Beijing, and two Canadians working in China were arrested soon after on vague allegations of endangering national security — a move widely seen as retaliation against Ottawa.

The U.S. and Australia, key intelligence allies of Canada, have already taken steps to curb Huawei's participation in 5G networks.

In the House of Commons, the Conservatives have persistently needled the Trudeau government over the issue.

""When will the Liberals ban Huawei?"" Conservative MP Steven Blaney asked Blair during a recent question period.

""Would they rather see Canadians' personal information in the hands of the Chinese?""

Blair's answer underscored the fact the government has long had a security-review program in place to manage cybersecurity risks that might stem from new equipment and services.

""We will continue to work with telecommunication service providers and the vendors through this collaborative program to mitigate the security concerns,"" Blair said. ""We will examine all security, economic and global considerations when making this determination.""

Canada will be watching closely for Britain's coming decision on Huawei's participation in its 5G projects. If Boris Johnson's new government adopts the Australian and U.S. line, it could be more politically challenging for Canada to embrace Huawei.

Ottawa's examination of 5G technology and the associated security and economic dimensions will include ""the careful consideration of our allies' advice,"" Bardsley said.

For its part, Huawei insists it will remain committed to Canada, no matter how the 5G microchips fall.

""Regardless of the decision, our position is we will continue to serve our customers in Canada with our products and networks,"" Howes said. ""And we will continue to enhance our investments in R and D.""

A precious life was lost on Christmas Eve. Yang Wen, a female doctor in Beijing's Civil Aviation General Hospital, was stabbed in the neck by a man named Sun Wenbin, exposing the vulnerability of doctors who dedicate their lives to saving others.

Sun, 55, is the son of a 95-year-old female patient who has been suffering a stroke for years and lately in coma. Four days after the brutal attack, China passed a new law aimed at preventing violence against medical practitioners.

That such brutal attacks should be strongly condemned and the perpetrator brought to justice goes without saying. But the public also needs to think about some deep-rooted social challenges caused by fast aging reflected in the bloody attack.

The elderly woman had been in the emergency ward for nearly 20 days because she couldn't be moved to a normal ward for want of a bed. Which meant the healthcare insurance system may not cover a large part of her medical bill. Sun's family said that was one of the reasons Sun and his family got into conflicts with the hospital. And unfortunately, the doctor became a victim of that conflict.

For years people have been complaining about how difficult it is to get a bed allotted in a hospital, especially in a major hospital. And the growing aging population is increasing the burden on the healthcare insurance system by consuming an increasing part of medical resources.

By the end of 2018, the number of people aged above 60 had reached 249 million, more than 17 percent of the total population. The figure is expected to increase to 255 million in 2020. Since a country with more than 10 percent of its population above 60 is termed an aging society, the seriousness of China's problem should be lost on no one.

The World Health Organization has issued an alert on the dramatically rising pace of aging population across the world. France had almost 150 years to adapt to the rise in aging population from 10 percent to 20 percent of the total, whereas China has to adapt to the change in slightly more than 20 years.

Some official statistics will help gauge the magnitude of China's aging population problem. In 2018, only 9.7 percent of the total working population needed hospitalization compared with 42.1 percent of the retirees. In 2018, the total income of the national medical insurance fund was about 2.13 trillion yuan ($305.90 billion) while the total expenditure was 1.78 trillion yuan. To strike a balance between the income and expenditure of the medical insurance fund, hospitals are assigned different medical insurance quotas. The hospitals are also evaluated on the basis of how frequently they assign a bed to a new patient.

Maybe that's why many hospitals are reluctant to allot a bed to a time - and fund-consuming patient who has a slim hope of recovery, because by allotting a bed to such a patient for a long duration, especially toward the end of the year, hospitals could lose part of their allotted medical insurance quota.

If Sun had been conscientious, he should have been grateful to the hospital and doctors for keeping his mother in the emergency ward instead of venting his anger on the innocent doctor.

Take the case of an 89-year-old woman in Guangzhou. She was forced to shift from one hospital to another in December after suffering a stroke and had to spend her last 44 days in four hospitals. The case indicates how urgently the authorities need to improve the healthcare system to deal with the rising aging population problem.

The aged women in Beijing and Guangzhou are just two of the 44 million aged people who are disabled or partly disabled after suffering a stroke or heart attack, or due to other medical conditions. In fact, Beijing Normal University's sociology department has said that the number of such partly disabled aged people will be between 68.52 million and 75.9 million in 2020, while that of totally disabled aged people will be between 5.99 million and 6.74 million.

The healthcare system and other elderly-care mechanisms are far from prepared to deal with looming aging population challenge.

According to the China National Committee on Aging, in 2020 China will have 29 million people aged above 80. And the WHO has forecast that by 2050 China will have about 125 million people aged above 80. Also, in 2050 at least 100 million of the 480 million people aged above 60 will be partly or totally disabled due to various health conditions.

So apart from increasing investment in quality hospitals, the authorities should also build more public nursing facilities to ease the pressure on hospitals, provide more community services to support aged residents, and use technology to lower the cost of medical and elderly care.

The year 2019 ended on a bloody note for the healthcare and eldercare systems because of the stabbing incident, which showed that not only do our doctors and nurses need protection, but also that the eldercare system needs improvement. So let us take a solemn pledge that from 2020 we will respect and better protect medical practitioners, and do more to improve our care for the elderly.

The United States-China trade war entered its second year in 2019, increasingly weighing on both economies amid worsening business sentiment globally.

Here are six charts that look at how the world's top two economies and their financial markets have performed in the year.

Economic growth slows

Growth in gross domestic product — the broadest measure of an economy — slowed down in both the U.S. and China last year.

© Provided by CNBC

Several economists predicted that growth rates in both countries could moderate even more in 2020, due to their continued trade friction and respective domestic challenges. That would add pressure to an already fragile global economy.

Trade volume declines

Overall exports and imports fell in both countries in the first ten months of 2019, compared to a year ago. That came amid slower trading activity worldwide — a trend some experts said started even before the U.S.-China trade war.

© Provided by CNBC

The overall U.S. trade deficit, mostly contributed by a bilateral imbalance with China, hasn't changed much in the year. That's despite the U.S.-China trade imbalance falling from $344.5 billion in the January-to-October 2018 period to $294.5 billion a year later, according to data by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Manufacturing downturn

The manufacturing sectors of the U.S. and China have felt the pinch of a slowing global economy, which was made worse by the trade war between the two countries.

© Provided by CNBC

China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index — a widely watched indicator of the sector's health — has stayed in contraction territory for most of the year. That means the index came in below the 50-point level. In the U.S., the manufacturing PMI compiled by the Institute for Supply Management showed factory activity contracting since August.

Retail sales steady

Consumer spending in the U.S. and China were among the bright spots of their respective economies in 2019, supported by a steady labor market in both economies.

But there are risks the optimism may not sustain.

Some analysts warned that additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods could dampen spending among American consumers. In China, rising pork prices may cut consumer spending in other areas, said Francis Tan, investment strategist at Singapore's UOB Private Bank.

Currency movements

A relatively strong U.S. economy and investors' preference for safe-haven assets increased demand for the greenback, lifting the currency's value for 2019.

In contrast, Chinese authorities allowed the yuan to depreciate for most of the year. That move attracted accusations of currency manipulation from U.S. President Donald Trump, but the International Monetary Fund said the value of the yuan was in line with China's economic fundamentals.

Stock market rally

In financial markets, rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and receding trade war tensions during certain periods in the year supported investor sentiment and sent stocks on Wall Street to multiple new highs this year despite weak corporate earnings.

18083,b795a17f4c40067144871ab3e285f4b3,"US IMPERIALISM launched an unprovoked wave of airstrikes against targets in both Syria and Iraq on Sunday, targeting bases controlled by Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), killing at least 25 of its fighters.

The PMF is an Iranian-backed Shia militia which has formal links to the official Iraqi army and has played a decisive role in the war against the Islamist terror group ISIS in both Iraq and Syria.

PMF forces led the fight against ISIS, spawned out of the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq by the US and its imperialist allies in 2003 and then transported into Syria as a mercenary force to overthrow the Syrian government.

Having launched a surprise attack on PMF forces without informing the Iraqi government of their murderous intentions, the Trump administration must have known this would provoke a response.

On Tuesday, they got it when hundreds of angry demonstrators in PMF uniforms converged on the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad which contains the US Embassy.

Shouting ‘Down, Down USA’, the demonstrators entered the Green Zone, forcing the US ambassador to flee and the rest of the embassy staff to take shelter in a ‘safe room’.

With US personnel holed up in the embassy, Trump immediately issued a warning to both Iran and Iraq, saying that ‘Iran has orchestrated the attack on the US embassy in Baghdad’ and warning that the US would ‘hold Iran responsible’ for this event and that Iran ‘will pay a very big price’.

US secretary of state Mike Pompeo warned that the US ‘will protect and defend its people, who are there to support a sovereign and independent Iraq’.

The hypocrisy of US imperialism is breathtaking. They bomb and kill with impunity and then claim they are protecting the sovereignty and independence of Iraq, a country they devastated in 2003 with war and occupations.

The US immediately announced that 750 extra US troops would be sent to the region in addition to the 14,000 already deployed in the Gulf since last May.

It was also reported that 4,000 more US troops might also be deployed.

This escalation of the war drive has been fuelled by recent joint naval drills held by Iran with Russia and China – a four-day naval exercise in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman and dubbed ‘Marine Security Belt’.

The commander of Iran’s navy, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, told reporters that these joint manoeuvres were a signal to US forces in the Gulf region, saying, ‘Today, the era of American free action in the region is over,’ adding, ‘They must leave the region gradually.’

The response of US imperialism to this threat against its dominance in the region was the provocative attack on Iran-supported PMF to coincide with these joint manoeuvres. Control of the narrow Gulf straits through which one fifth of all oil supplies must pass is strategically vital to US imperialism and it is prepared to go to war to protect its oil supplies.

Despite all claims that the US is gradually withdrawing from the region, there has been a continuous build-up of US troops to ‘protect’ their interests.

In Syria, troops and tanks were deployed to the north east of the country to take control of the region’s oil fields and facilitate the theft of the country’s oil reserves by the US. The US has no intention of leaving the region, gradually or not – it will have to be driven out.

US imperialism is preparing to go all-out in a war with Iran, drive back the Iranian revolution and impose its complete military control over the Middle East and the Gulf. Such a war will not only set the entire region ablaze but will drag in both Russia and China and pose the immediate threat of world war.

Workers across the world must take action against this threat of imperialism’s war of conquest by disarming the imperialist powers with socialist revolutions in the UK and the USA.

Only socialist revolution can put an end to imperialist war against the working class at home and the people of the world."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Governor Northam wants to allocation millions to take away our guns and we need to ask legislators face-to-face if they are going to support that budget item. There are four hearings tomorrow, January 2: NoVA, Blacksburg, Hampton Roads, and Richmond.

To get this out quickly, I am using an alert that GOA put together – VCDL thanks them:

Please Make Plans to Attend a Meeting and Show Your Support for 2A-Protected Rights!

The state's Democratic legislature will be holding hearings on Gov. “Blackface” Northam's anti-gun budget in four locations around the state tomorrow (on Thursday).

We understand that this is short notice. But it would have a significant impact if many of our members could show up and make a 3-minute statement and ask questions of the legislators in attendance

We have to speak out, because your rights are under attack by the Governor of Virginia. Consider:

Governor “Blackface” is supporting SB 16, which would ban commonly-owned firearms in more than one million Virginia households — a ban that would even outlaw sporting weapons such as the Mossberg 930 Snow Goose.

The Governor has requested $4 million and 18 law-enforcement positions to enforce his gun ban — a request that could be the preparatory steps for confiscating the guns which would be banned by SB 16.

Moreover, the Governor is requesting another $3.5 million to enforce gun control that has NOT been passed by the legislature and is NOT even current law in Virginia: universal background checks, one gun a month limitations, so-called “red flag” gun confiscation orders, and more.

We need to get as many pro-gun Virginians as possible to attend these meetings and demand to know if the Delegates and Senators plan to allocate money — as delineated in the budget — to confiscate common, household firearms from Virginia citizens.

You can have up to three minutes to speak to the Delegates and Senators who will be in attendance. And because they sit on the appropriations committee, you might want to consider the following types of questions for them to consider:

1) The Governor is requesting $7.5 million to enforce a gun ban, Universal Background Checks, a one-gun a month limitation, “red flag” gun confiscation orders and more. Do you support this appropriation of money even though NONE of these provisions are currently the law in Virginia?

2) Given that NONE of these gun control restrictions are currently the law in Virginia, would you support a budget amendment preventing the governor from using any funds to implement these anti-rights restrictions via executive order?

3) Would you support a budget amendment that would prohibit any funds from being used to implement the provisions of any new Northam gun laws until a final judgment is received from the Supreme Court that they are constitutional?

4) Would you support or oppose a budget amendment prohibiting the governor from using the National Guard or police to implement any confiscation or registration of firearms pursuant to legislation passed by the General Assembly?

5) Would you support or oppose a budget amendment prohibiting a locality from using any funds made available to such locality to implement any confiscation or registration of firearms pursuant to legislation passed by the General Assembly?

6) Would you support or oppose any budget amendment attempting to penalize Second Amendment localities by reducing funds otherwise available to those localities because of their Second Amendment Sanctuary status?

7) Would you support legislation to immediately outlaw and confiscate guns, without compensation, when the gun can currently be legally owned in Virginia and all 49 other states? Moreover, if that provision was challenged and overturned, would it be okay with you if the costs of such a lawsuit were placed on those legislators who voted for it?

These are just a sampling of the types of questions that could be asked of legislators on Thursday.

You will notice that all the questions above have a money slant to them. Again, that’s important because these meetings are being run by the Delegates and Senators who sit on the appropriations committee.

The official announcement from the General Assembly states that the purpose of these four meetings is to “receive comments on the Governor's proposed 2020-22 biennial state budget.” If you wish to speak, you may “register at each hearing site no earlier than one hour prior to the start of the hearing [and] speakers are asked to limit their comments to three minutes or less.”

18257,b36febec294e2e0422f49176e0d519c3,"Australians are used to hot summers. Drought, bushfires and days above 40 degrees. But this summer has been extraordinary - more than five million hectares burned, at least 16 people dead nationally and several missing in Victoria, at least 1300 homes gone, the eastern seaboard choked by smoke and thousands of people trapped on beaches, driven to the ocean by flames.

And it's only early January.

There are months left to run in the fire season, which began early in NSW when the first fires broke out in September. As well as the threat the fires pose to towns and small communities across Australia, they also pose a threat to the Morrison Government. There is deep concern across Australia and internationally about the extremes of weather this summer.

At the risk of adding another feelpinion to an already overcrowded field, it does have the feel of a tipping point, that enough is enough and the government must do something about it.

On Tuesday, Scott Morrison hit the right note when he called in the Australian Defence Force. The decision showed the government understood the scale of the crisis and was prepared to throw everything at it. The sight of a massive Navy ship arriving into Mallacoota on Thursday, and Army and Navy helicopters clattering about over remote towns in Gippsland, will give residents confidence that help is on its way, along with much-needed supplies.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has looked flat-footed and defensive.



But until then, Morrison had looked flat-footed and defensive.

His sudden announcement last Sunday that he'd be providing one-off payments to compensate volunteer firefighters up to $6000 for the weeks and they'd spent on the fire front looked rushed and a bit panicked, despite his claims they'd been working on it for some time. And the deal was done initially with only the (Liberal) Berejiklian government in NSW, making it look like a hasty deal cobbled together with a friendly government to get the PM out a political jam.

South Australia has since signed up and while the Labor states of Queensland and Victoria were playing silly buggers over the offer, it would be a brave government that stops its volunteer firefighters from getting $6000 in free money from Canberra when their fellow volunteers across the border can have it. Indeed Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk has now signed up.

Then there was the ill-timed holiday Morrison took overseas with his wife and daughters.

He works hard and should be entitled to a week off. Comparisons with former Victorian police commissioner Christine Nixon leaving her post on Black Saturday were hysterical and unfair. But the optics were bad, as Sydney-siders continued to breathe in toxic smoke and two volunteer firefighters died. He lost a lot of political capital over it.

Anyway, all of this is reactive. The elephant is the room is climate change and the government's response to it.

No political party in Australia had been able to deliver a sustainable, acceptable policy on climate change.

Morrison acknowledges human intervention is contributing to climate change. Yet formulating an energy and climate policy has been eluding political parties and leaders for years, with Rudd, Gillard, Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison (so far) all unable to legislate a long-term policy.

Since the Coalition party room killed off the National Energy Agreement, the market is in flux, unsure where to invest. The governmental response seems piecemeal, such as underwriting a new gas plant in Dandenong.

It's almost impossible to have a sensible debate here on climate change. Thanks to the shouty types on social media, it's become heresy to point out that Australia directly produces just 1.3 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, so can't unilaterally shift the dial in any meaningful way.

Equally, Australia, as a wealthy, developed democracy, should be showing leadership and sitting near the head of the global pack in emission reduction strategies.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack has complained about ""woke capital city greenies'' agitating about climate change when fires were burning.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack.

But look at some of those who have identified climate change as an issue - the Reserve Bank, the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Department of Home Affairs. Not a dreadlock or home-knit jumper to be seen.

In an opinion piece published on these pages yesterday, Prime Minister Morrison said: ""Australians have never been fussed about trying to impress people overseas.''

But surely he'd prefer that the international media was not devoting thousands of words to Australia' bushfire crisis, with photos of Sydney Harbour bathed in toxic orange smoke, our wildlife burning to death and scared people crammed on to eerie orange beaches escaping the flames.

Before Christmas the French daily Liberation took out its entire front page with a high-impact photograph of a firefighter and a burning tree and a headline which translated as ""Australia an incendiary climate''.

""Three million hectares burned, Sydney plunges into an orange mist, the out of control fires ravaging a country in the middle of a drought sound like a new alert on climate change,'' it screamed.

Across pages two, three and four, there were more confronting photos and a picture of Morrison under a headline which read, ""Prime Minister in flagrant denial''.

Coverage such as that in the centre-left Liberation won't move a vote in Australia, so Morrison won't lose sleep over it. But he should be up in the wee hours thinking about how to better protect Australia from such disasters in the first place.

A statement issued by the embassy on Wednesday said that ""due to militia attacks at the US embassy compound, all public consular operations are suspended until further notice"", reports Xinhua news agency.

""All future appointments are cancelled. US citizens are advised to not approach the embassy.""

The US Consulate General in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan, ""is open for visa and American citizen services appointments"", it added.

The statement came hours after the supporters of the Kataib Hezbollah (KH) militia group, a faction of Hashd Shaabi or the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), who stormed the embassy withdrew from the perimeter of the embassy.

The protest started on Tuesday when hundreds of mourners, wearing Hashd Shaabi's military uniforms, rallied outside the embassy, chanting slogans against the December 29 US attack on KH bases in Iraq and Syria.

The protest then turned violent as the protesters managed to break into an outer yard of the embassy, but were repelled by the security forces who deployed tear gas against them.

Local media footage showed Qais al-Khazali, head of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq militia, and top Hashd Shaabi leader Hadi Al Amri and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis participating in the protest.

On December 29, the US forces bombarded headquarters of Hashd Shaabi's 45th and 46th Brigades, leaving 25 killed and 51 injured.

""The government has given suggestion to the Central government, which is in a process to frame the rules for the Citizenship Amendment Act to incorporate state government`s view so that interest of indigenous people remains protected,"" Sonowal told media.

The Assam CM remarked that he is also ""son of this soil and will not compromise with the interest of indigenous people"" at any cost. Sonowal urged the people of Assam to trust him and not get misled by rumours spread by oppoistion parties on the CAA.

Sonowal blamed the 'destructive elements' for causing violence and arson in Assam after the passage of Citizenship Amendment Bill. ""A section has misguided the people by claiming that the CAA will make 1.5 crore Hindus of Bangladesh eligible for citizenship.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau heads into 2020 promising to chart a path to Canada's most ambitious greenhouse gas emissions target yet -- getting to the point where Canada is adding no emissions that will stay in the atmosphere within 30 years. Prime Minister Trudeau speaks with The Canadian Press during a year end interview in West Block on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2019. Image Credit: THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld

January 01, 2020 - 6:00 PM

OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau heads into 2020 promising to chart a path to Canada's most ambitious greenhouse-gas emissions target yet: getting to a point within 30 years where Canada is adding no emissions that will stay in the atmosphere.

But one of the first things his government has to decide in the new year is whether to give cabinet approval to a major new oilsands project that environment advocates say is absolutely incompatible with reaching the ""net-zero"" target.

Environment groups say the decision will send a signal about how serious Trudeau is about ramping up Canada's plans to cut emissions and do its part to slow global warming.

If his government rejects the project, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has warned, that will send a signal that Canada's oil-and-gas sector has no future.

Rock, meet political hard place.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Trudeau said he has ""been unabashed that we have to get ahead of the fight against climate change and be really thoughtful about how we are moving forward.""

Moments earlier, in the same interview, he acknowledged he is not ruling out approving the Teck Frontier mine north of Fort McMurray, Alta.

""We have a process that is ongoing and I am not going to speculate on those outcomes,"" he said.

A joint federal-provincial review panel gave conditional approval to the $20.6-billion Frontier mine in July, finding it was in the national interest. It's expected to create $12 billion in tax revenues for Ottawa and $55 billion in tax and royalty revenues for Alberta over its 41-year life. About 7,000 jobs will be created in building the mine and 2,500 workers will be needed to operate it.

The panel also found the mine would cause ""significant adverse environmental effects"" to local wetlands and old-growth forests, and have some irreversible impacts on biodiversity.

It will, the panel noted, be a significant producer of greenhouse gases and likely make it harder for Canada to meet both its 2030 targets under the Paris climate-change agreement and its loftier 2050 goals. That fact was irrelevant to the panel's decision because the review was done under now-obsolete rules, under which climate change was not within the purview of the review panel.

Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said during a visit to Calgary the week before Christmas that the Frontier mine's approval will be contingent on determining how it fits into the ""net zero by 2050"" goal. Net zero, a phrase Canadians will be hearing a lot in 2020, means that whatever carbon dioxide or related substances are sent into the atmosphere can be absorbed by natural ""sinks"" like forests and wetlands, or engineered ones that capture carbon either to be used another way or stored.

The Frontier mine would be expected to produce 260,000 barrels of oil a day, and produce about four million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year, for more than 40 years. Every time Canada adds more emissions to the mix, it pushes the goals further and further out of reach.

Catherine Abreu, executive director of the Climate Action Network Canada, said the mine review is ""the first test"" of the Liberals' insistence that climate is at the heart of their policy-making.

""If they are serious about net-zero by 2050 they cannot in good faith approve the largest oilsands mine proposed in Canadian history, that is scheduled to operate until 2067,"" Abreu said. ""A project of that scale, of emissions of that concentration, just blows all of those targets and all of those good intentions out of the water.""

Wilkinson said there is no question, based on the results of the federal election in October, that Canadians want more ambitious action to slow climate change.

But he said it is also clear ""the vast majority of Canadians also are pragmatic"" and want climate action to come with a prosperous economy. For him, clean technology is the way out of the quagmire.

""In the short term it is about (getting) resources to market,"" he said. ""In the long term it will evolve towards clean technology, technology that will enable us to reduce the footprint we have and do so in a manner that will create economic opportunity.""

Wilkinson's 2020 to-do list, he said, starts with figuring out how to close the 77-million-tonne gap between the policies Canada has in place and the existing 2030 climate target to reduce emissions to 30 per cent below where they were in 2005.

That figure, updated just a week ago, comes from projections of Canada's emissions based on existing policies and those that are fairly firmly set to be implemented in the coming years, such as standards to make gasoline burn with fewer emissions and to curb methane released from oil and gas production, and plans to plant two billion new trees.

At the end of 2018, Ottawa expected to be 79 million tonnes shy of the 2030 goal.

When new policies like the carbon tax offset by increases in emissions from the oil and gas sector, and revisions to how much carbon dioxide trees are expected to absorb, the progress towards Canada's 2030 goal in the last year was just two million tonnes.

The Paris target requires Canada to cut greenhouse gases produced from 730 million tonnes in 2005 to 511 million tonnes in 2030. The combination of existing and planned policies is projected to get Canada to 588 million tonnes by 2030.

But the government is now not just promising to hit the Paris targets. Trudeau promised during the election to exceed them, and get to net zero by 2050. Canada is also supposed to take a more ambitious plan to cut emissions to the next United Nations climate meeting, planned for Scotland in November.

Wilkinson warns that despite the pressure to act quickly, the needed changes are not going to get done overnight.

""What we're talking about is changing the way we transport goods and people,"" he said. ""We're talking about (changing) the way we generate energy, how we deal with waste, how we actually build our buildings, how we retrofit existing buildings. All of those are doable but people have to be realistic about how long that takes.""

Canadians can expect legislation in 2020 to set five-year goals on the way to both 2030 and 2050 emissions targets. Tim Gray, the executive director of Environmental Defence, said the details of that legislation are critical, including how it will be enforced. He is hopeful that the government will create an independent agency to file progress reports.

Abreu said she wants some very specific goals within those five-year increments, such as how many people will be using public transit by a certain year.

Canada has already set a goal for 10 per cent of all vehicle purchased to be electric by 2025, and 30 per cent by 2030. Between two and three per cent of new vehicles are electric now.

Besides the Teck mine decision, Ottawa has another call to make early in the new year — whether to allow British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta to use their own proposed regulations to cut methane emissions, or be forced to use Ottawa's version.

Alberta's Premier Kenney put approving his province's methane regulations on his list of demands from Trudeau when he visited Ottawa earlier in December. The first stage of the new federal regulations go into effect Jan. 1. Ottawa is allowing Alberta to use its own for now but is still negotiating a final agreement because federal officials don't think Alberta's version will reduce as much methane as Ottawa's would. Alberta officials disagree.

Albertans are already set to start paying the federal carbon tax on Jan. 1, although Ottawa did recently give Alberta the green light to use its own pricing system for pollution coming from big industry like oilsands, power plants and mines.

Also coming up in 2020 is a review of carbon taxes for their impact on competitiveness, which could shine some light on whether the federal carbon tax is harming the economy.

The national carbon price on fuel purchases will rise to $30 a tonne on April 1, adding about another 2.5 cents to the cost of a litre of gas.

Doctors said that the virus breaks down the lining of the lungs, which then breaks off into the air pipe and clogs it.

Babies will cough, choke, and can vomit from coughing so much, and even will work so hard to breathe that their lungs get tired.

This year, doctors have seen a rise in the number of patients that have RSV.

“We are seeing a much larger volume of inpatients this year with RSV then we have in the previous several years so I do advise moms of newborn babies, parents of new borns to really keep them protected from this virus,” Lauren Mcgover, Clinical Director of Pediatrics at PRMC, said. “We have children that do go intro respiratory failure for this and babies can die from RSV, it’s rare but it can happen so we want everybody to take the symptoms very seriously.”

© Craig F. Walker/Globe Staff Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights, said he suspects Boston police are withholding information to avoid public criticism.

Facing outrage from civil rights advocates, police officials said they would institute new antibias policies, require officers to document why they initiated a stop, and provide annual statistics on street investigations.

“We want to be as transparent as we possibly can,” then-commissioner William Evans said at the time.

But police officials stopped delivering on the promise. The department has not released data on street investigations, known as Field Interrogations and Observations, since the end of 2016 and is not currently compiling the information for the public, a department spokesman said. That has left the community — and the department itself — with no way to know whether the racial disparities in street investigations have persisted.

“The last time FIO data was released was in 2017 and only included 2016 data, which showed that communities of color made up a disproportionate share of police stops and interactions,” City Council President Andrea Campbell said. “In order to have meaningful policy conversation and eliminate these disparities, it’s essential that BPD annually release this data, which should indeed be considered public information.”

Officers continue to file individual reports on street encounters and use the information in investigations, Sergeant Detective John Boyle said. But they are no longer compiling the data or making it public.

“We would love to see the data to see if the city has made progress — because if the city has made progress, we should recognize that,” said Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Boston-based Lawyers for Civil Rights. “But without that data, we are left to wonder if the racial disparities that have plagued the city continue.”

Boyle said the department did not make a deliberate decision to stop publishing the data. But the department, he said, had not received any requests for updated statistics until a recent Globe inquiry, and that assembling the database is time-consuming. An employee who had compiled and analyzed the data moved to a different job in another unit within the department, Boyle said.

Boyle subsequently said that the department may compile the information for public release in January.

“Our goal is to post information online that is frequently requested by members of the public as part of our efforts to build a more transparent and open government,” a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J. Walsh said.

In the 2015 study, conducted at the request of police and the ACLU of Massachusetts, researchers examined nearly 205,000 FIOs from 2007 to 2010. About 40 percent led to a frisk or search, while 24 percent were observational, meaning the subjects may not have been aware they were being watched.

Police have said the racial disparity is misleading because a small number of people are frequent targets of police observation, skewing the overall numbers. In 2015, Evans said 5 percent of people who were the subject of investigations accounted for 40 percent of stops.

The vast majority of violent crime in Boston occurs in sections of Dorchester, Roxbury, and Mattapan, which have large black and Latino populations.

In response to the racial disparity, police officials instituted a new policy that forbids policing based on characteristics such as race and gender, and states that discipline may occur if an officer “engages in biased policing.”

They pledged to report FIO data annually and that officers who conducted the most FIOs would be retrained.

In 2016, Boston police released information about nearly 150,000 FIOs conducted from 2011 to April 2015, showing a reduced investigative focus on black residents.

During that period, 58.5 percent of all FIO subjects were black, 22.8 percent white, and 13.1 percent Hispanic. Just over 74 percent of FIO subjects had “prior records reported by the officers.”

But the following year, a Globe analysis found that the numbers had shifted again, with nearly 70 percent of street investigations in 2016 involving black people. The analysis also found that the number of recorded interactions had declined dramatically — from a high of 55,684 in 2008 to 14,995 in 2016.

Espinoza-Madrigal said he suspects the department is withholding the information to avoid public criticism.

“By taking away the collection of this important data that rightfully belongs in the public domain, the department is shielding itself from public scrutiny and transparency,” he said. “It’s almost as if the department anticipates that the data will continue to reveal racial disparities and it’s trying to cover that up to avoid embarrassment.”

18610,cc1fabc7da97059f457bc1dc4858828f,"“We want to be as transparent as we possibly can,” then-commissioner William Evans said at the time.

Facing outrage from civil rights advocates, police officials said they would institute new antibias policies, require officers to document why they initiated a stop, and provide annual statistics on street investigations.

Four years ago, a report found that Boston police officers were stopping, searching, and recording observations of black Bostonians at a disproportionate rate.

But police officials stopped delivering on the promise. The department has not released data on street investigations, known as Field Interrogations and Observations, since the end of 2016 and is not currently compiling the information for the public, a department spokesman said. That has left the community — and the department itself — with no way to know whether the racial disparities in street investigations have persisted.

“The last time FIO data was released was in 2017 and only included 2016 data, which showed that communities of color made up a disproportionate share of police stops and interactions,” City Council President Andrea Campbell said. “In order to have meaningful policy conversation and eliminate these disparities, it’s essential that BPD annually release this data, which should indeed be considered public information.”

Officers continue to file individual reports on street encounters and use the information in investigations, Sergeant Detective John Boyle said. But they are no longer compiling the data or making it public.

“We would love to see the data to see if the city has made progress — because if the city has made progress, we should recognize that,” said Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Boston-based Lawyers for Civil Rights. “But without that data, we are left to wonder if the racial disparities that have plagued the city continue.”

Boyle said the department did not make a deliberate decision to stop publishing the data. But the department, he said, had not received any requests for updated statistics until a recent Globe inquiry, and that assembling the database is time-consuming. An employee who had compiled and analyzed the data moved to a different job in another unit within the department, Boyle said.

Boyle subsequently said that the department may compile the information for public release in January.

18616,2c06ff0bf4953bddca0261db188d620a,"PRIME Minister Scott Morrison has called for Australians to be patient during the bushfires gripping the country.

“My simple request is to be patient, to have confidence in the state agencies,” Mr Morrison told media in Sydney on Thursday.

“I understand the anxiety and I understand the fear that is there for many and I understand the frustration, but this is a natural disaster.”

Mr Morrison pointed to the federal government’s existing efforts, including disaster relief payments and deploying defence personnel, as the action it was taking to help during the fires.

“What you cannot have in these situations is governments stepping over the top of each other in responding to a natural disaster like this,” he said.

“What we are saying is we cannot control the natural disaster but what we can do is control our response.”

Mr Morrison also said more needed to be done to reduce fuel loads and to address issues surrounding hazard reduction burns.

He said the National Security Committee would meet on Monday to discuss the bushfire.

The prime minister also called on Australians in bushfire areas to be patient and calm to help those fighting the blazes.

He said the NSW government had not asked for help in the South Coast region as the roads had been reopened.

Mr Morrison also defended the federal government’s climate change policies and said many factors contributed to the bushfires.

“The drought has created a tinder box around the country and that has, through various forms of ignition, has seen these fires run for long periods of time.”

He said no single climate policy would insure against bushfires and the government was working on beating its carbon emissions targets.

Federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese said that was only because of an accounting trick by using “carry-over credits” and Australia needed to show global leadership.

“Australia has an interest in being strong advocates for greater global action, not being a handbrake,” Mr Albanese said.

When it came to the bushfires, Mr Albanese said the prime minister had taken a business-as-usual approach.

“This is certainly not business-as-usual,” Mr Albanese said.

“People can now smell it, see it, feel it.”

Highlights PM spoke with leaders of Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal

Pakistan didn't figure in PM Modi's New Year call list on Wednesday

PM shared ""vision of shared peace, security, prosperity and progress""

Pakistan did not figure in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's New Year call list as he dialled the leaders of the neighbouring countries and highlighted India's commitment to the ""Neighbourhood First"" policy. In his conversation with the leaders of Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Bangladesh and Nepal, PM Modi focused on the ""vision of shared peace, security, prosperity and progress for all of India's friends and partners in the region"", the government said in a statement.

Less than a year ago, on February 14, a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 paramilitary soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama. Days later, the Air Force carried out the strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot, to which Pakistan retaliated, but failed to harm any Indian installations.

In the months that followed, Pakistan alternated between calls for resumption of dialogue and raising Kashmir in every international forum, including the United Nations General Assembly. India reiterated its stance that talks and terror cannot go hand in hand.

India also briefed other nations regrading the scrapping of Article 370 - which was the other big grouse of Pakistan. The matter, New Delhi said, was internal and the step was taken to give the people of Jammu and Kashmir the rights and facilities enjoyed by the rest of the country.

Yesterday, General MM Naravane, the new Army chief, took a tough line on Pakistan and the terror it sponsors, saying in such situations, ""We reserve the right to pre-emptively strike at sources of terror"".

This is PM Modi's first New Year after he won a second term with a massive victory in the national election held in April-May last year.

The government said in his conversation with Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Prime Minister agreed to further enhance ties this year. He also congratulated his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina on her re-election as the chief of the Awami League for three years.", Carry out suicide bombing,3

We are approaching a reckoning. This is the point, as the poet W. B. Yeats warned, when things fall apart and anarchy is loosed upon the world.” John W. Whitehead “Monsters with Human Faces: The Tyranny of the Police State Disguised as Law-and-Order.” Information Clearing House: 7/25/2019 January 01, 2020 "" Information Clearing House "" - In a synoptic view, global leaders professing to be wise and smart for being elected, turned out to be naïve, unthinkable and egoistically foolish. Once elected under the so-called democracy, they focus their minds on how to get reelected and how to continue a tragic normality of abnormality against the masses that elected them. Agreeably, in the 21st century knowledge-based political affairs require true and effective leadership having a comprehensive sense of human rights, dignity, kindness towards fellow human beings and versatile understanding of navigational change when facts of political life warrant a change. Most contemporary leaders of the world appear to rejoice self-centered evil-mongering, not wisdom and truth of people-oriented political systems of governance. Ideas and ideals that defy reasoning and truth are gushingly operative in aerial bombing of the innocents in Syria, killings of protesters in Iraq, India, Egypt, Chile, Venezuela, Bolivia, Kashmir, Yemen, Libya and not to mention of the large scale civilian displacements of refugees sheltered in Western European nations, Turkey and Lebanon out of bloodbath in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and forcibly evicted Rohinga Muslims from Mynamar (Burma). The end picture of the 2019 is not peace, harmony and global unity on these critical issues. These trends represent sadistic tendencies in democratic norms and a system of politics without any accountability and remedial action. Fear of the masses and hatred appears to be ingrained in the mental microscope of many political leaders. All authoritarian political leaders lack the imagination of moral and intellectual traits that should have been at the core of effective leadership. Be it the UN-the chief organ of global peace and security or the US, Russia and other EU nations, the sense of reality is missing in policies and practices. Millions and millions are bombed, charcoaled by chemical attacks, civilian unprotected by the Geneva Conventions, and the noble intents of the UN Charter, The US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights- all sound like insult to the “Common Sense” and to human intellect and political observations. Are You Tired Of The Lies And Non-Stop Propaganda? Get Your FREE Daily Newsletter When phony leaders fail to live up to the standards of morality and civilizations, they sink into vindictiveness of insanity, irrational behaviors and create political chaos and problems to keep the masses occupied in naive politics. Jesus is quoted in the Bible saying: “If the world hates you, you know it hated me before it hated you…if they persecuted me, they will also persecute you…John 15:18-25” How do We, the People of Human Conscience make these ugly and disingenuous politicians to learn from the history and change the course of events into peace and harmony with the masses all over the globe? Is the UN Meant to Protect the Mankind from the “scourge of wars”? Despite the UN and the global institutions of peace and security, We the People, We, the Humanity are strangled by well-planned warfare against our existence and survival on this planet. The perversion goes on unchallenged for long in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Kashmir. To discard the indifference and insanity of the global leadership toward human protection and survivability, all concerned global citizens must think to avert the ultimate impending cataclysmic destruction of mankind and Planet Earth. In all wars, mankind is the net victim of cruel acts of few warmongers. The news media plays pivotal role in manufacturing and transforming unspoken myths into thinkable notions in situations of unusual emergencies and societal conflicts. Despite knowledge and advanced intelligence networks, the industrialized nations fail to find workable protective measures from societal upheavals and extremism. Everywhere mankind is victimized by the unknown consequences of the few sadistic egoistic leaders, be it in Syria, Iraq, Bolivia, Kashmir, Chile, Palestine, India, Venezuela, Egypt and elsewhere. Did the UN or the international community realize the immediacy of the critical humanitarian crisis and daily bloodbath going-on in Syria, Iraq, South America, Yemen and elsewhere? Was that reality transformed into a living consciousness transcending momentarily the self-actualization for the collective goodness of global humanity? Living with fear and hatred drains out all rational human thinking for life and whatever values and concepts it claims for human rights, civility and the future. The long shadows of deaths and destruction of human habitats daily converge on the tv screen showing several thousand displaced refugees moving from nowhere to nowhere. The UN, its Security Council and the global humanity (if there is such a living entity) were supposed to prevent the forcible massacre of the innocent civilians and extend some sense of concerned humanity to the victims. They do not! So, it becomes a routine of aerial bombardments, deaths and displacement of people. Are We, the People, We the Humanity that ignorant, that blindfolded not to realize what is happening in our surroundings? Was it not the same historic reality that led to the Two World Wars by the few against many? Ignorance and Arrogance are Destroying Humankind We, humankind live on One Planet, whether you believe it or not, We are One Humanity. Looking critically at the 21st century global geopolitical affairs, it appears as if humanity and all the working notions of thinking and actions are at crossroads in search of peace, harmony, security and sustainable future. To imagine a common mathematical orderly manifestation, it is incumbent to have sustainable co-existence and harmonious collaboration between all the converging factors to emulate the end purpose for the good of all humankind. Few days ago, President Trump announced to set-up a “Space Force” – a galactic force to ensure the American security in space. Have these leaders solved any humanitarian problems on Earth? What rational criterion is implied to move the fear and hatred from the Earth to the Space? From Planet Earth to the outer Space, people are wired with unknown secretive and sophisticated weapons – the ticking time bombs of scientists and space experts. Man and ignorance continue to intervene and change the Nature of THINGS operative within the living Universe – why is it that humans cannot co-exist with humans on Earth – the Living Earth? The UN and the World Order – the Lost Reality of Humankind Since its inception, the UN is viewed by the global community as an institution to “protect the mankind from the scourge of war” by evolving and implementing a systematic approach to crisis analysis, conflict prevention and to ensure the security of the global governance and peaceful future for the humanity. Its major organ –The Security Council is seen as body of systematic mechanisms to deal with global issues of peace, security and prevention of war while facilitating the necessary framework through diplomacy, laws, procedures and directives based on the UNO Charter. Often the members of the Council fail to define their own role and responsibilities toward global humanity. Most often, they disagree with their own perceptions, statements and values during the deliberations. The survival of deprived humanity, the United Nations, international peace and harmony are everybody’s concern and priorities. Throughout the world, the educated and responsible intellectuals must address the question: how to develop a New Global Institution of functional relevance and credibility? As members of One Global Humanity, we must think how to construct a New World Organization accountable to humanity, and not to nation states? How could the UN be freed from the clutches of so-called superpowers? How can voices of reason and honesty be heard at the forums of international organizations? How 21st century’s challenges be met with innovation, responsible and timely governance and concrete responses to crises across the globe? How can human rights, human dignity, peace and security be assured to concerned humankind? How can humankind – the global community be represented in all of the participatory deliberations of new global institutions? Could We, the People and We Humanity be optimistic for the coming of 2020? Unless the elite and corrupt systems of so-called democracy change, there is no hope of any formidable political change for the next year. Learning from the unpleasant facts and making changes in perceptions, policies and strategic direction is a rational choice to intelligent leadership. We do need men of new ideas and creative strategies to safeguard the future of mankind from ignorance and arrogance of fellow men. One could propose a workable solution to the bewildered global leadership’s mindset if the leaders could be sent on a space voyage to see Planet Earth as is from the above and try to understand its operational existence – who is governing the universe – what Majestic Power facilitates all that is essential for life and growth; how the earth rotates against the sun, how the water, seas, mountains stand in obedience to their Creator – the Lord of the World- the Creator of life and death; how the universe and human species are connected together and the imperatives of living in co-existence with the rest of mankind. Perhaps, such an exploratory visit to space will help to melt down some of their inborn arrogance, indifference and cruelty to the fellow human beings. The outcome could produce human optimism and pave the conducive opportunities and means for peacemaking and co-existence. Indeed, leadership adaptability to change in democracy is a mark of intelligence and responsibility. Dr. Mahboob A.

""I want to tell the Maharashtra Chief Minister that the Karnataka government will not tolerate any trouble to Kannadigas in Maharashtra,"" he told reporters.

His statement comes in the backdrop of Shiv Sena workers reportedly hitting the streets in Kolhapur on Sunday and burning effigies of Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and stopping screening of Kannada films there. The activists had also blackened billboards, having Kannada text, of some shopkeepers in Gandhinagar area.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had in December last year appointed ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as co-coordinators to oversee his government's efforts to expedite the case relating to the boundary dispute with Karnataka.

The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, which has been fighting for the merger of 800-odd villages with Maharashtra, had recently submitted a memorandum of their demands to Uddhav Thackeray.

Maharashtra claims the border district of Belagavi was part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, but is currently a district of Karnataka, on linguistic grounds. Savadi, who hails from Belagavi, said the Maharashtra Chief Minister would do well to recall what his cousin Raj Thackeray had said in the past on the matter.

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray had said in October 2014 in Mumbai politicians from the state have never been serious about finding a solution to the dispute and the issue has always been used for politics.

The MNS chief had recalled that when MEK members had met him a few years ago, he had said he was prepared, if required, to meet the then Karnataka chief minister to discuss the issue and demand that there should not be injustice on Marathi speaking people living in Belgaum and nearby areas.

On 30 December, Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa had accused Uddhav Thackeray of raking up the Belagavi issue again for political gains and declared that 'not even an inch of land' would be given away.

The drop was 0.5% from November 2018.While loans to micro and small businesses shrank 3.4% since the beginning of FY20 against a contraction of 2.7% in the same timeframe last year, advances to medium-sized firms contracted 3.6% as against growth of 1.4% during March-November 2018.Between November 2018 and 2019, gross loans to micro and small industries fell 0.1% and medium-sized units contracted 2.4%, compared with growth of 1.1% and 11%, respectively, a year earlier.“In an environment of slowdown, where the overall credit growth of the industry is waning, most banks increase scrutiny standards while giving loans, especially to the corporate sector,” said a banker requesting anonymity. “There have been several instances of promoters of these smaller companies trying to leverage more than what was on the block to get quick access to working capital. Banks are now becoming more prudent while lending to them.”The shrinking credit pie comes even after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made revival of MSMEs a priority in recent policies. The sector’s contribution to GDP is estimated to be 30% and these small businesses are instrumental in generating employment.Throughout last year, the government instructed banks to disburse working capital loans to these businesses through new schemes and channels such as festive season loan melas, the PSB59 loan portal and older ones including Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana and TREDS-based bill discounting platforms.“Banks lend with the concept of risk returns. If a particular credit is not commercially viable, then banks won’t disburse it despite the broader directions they may have been given,” said Prakash Agarwal, head of banking and financial ratings at India Ratings.“With risk aversion being the new guiding principle of the Indian banking industry, banks have started to reduce working capital limits, increase risk premium — thereby charging effective interest of over 16% — and insist on additional security when these SMEs are not even generating positive Ebitda,” said Sridhar Ramachandran, CIO of IndiaNivesh Renaissance Fund. “Even large public-sector banks, once the backbone of economic development and now rightly concerned about non-performing assets, are avoiding lending to companies that are less than investment grade.”The Reserve Bank of India has warned banks about mounting defaults in accounts structured under the government’s MUDRA scheme, signifying risks associated with such loans.“The MUDRA is a case in point… while such a massive push would have lifted many beneficiaries out of poverty, there has been some concern at the growing level of non-performing assets among these borrowers,” RBI deputy governor MK Jain said at a recent industry event. “Banks need to focus on repayment capacity at the appraisal stage and monitor the loans through the lifecycle much more closely.”The Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency Ltd (MUDRA) was set up by the government to develop and refinance micro-enterprises by supporting finance institutions that lend to such businesses engaged in manufacturing, trading and service activities."," Threaten, not specified below",3
18972,f51e47a0d37bbbec2e4acb4349cfd4da,"Trump warns Iran after Iraqi protesters storm US embassy in Baghdad



By Ahmad al-Rubaye with Paul Handley in Washington



Baghdad (AFP) Dec 31, 2019



The US flew a rapid response team of Marines into Baghdad to reinforce its embassy on Tuesday after a mob of pro-Iranian demonstrators stormed the compound, setting fires and chanting ""Death to America!""

Angered by US air strikes that killed two dozen fighters, hundreds of protesters spilled through checkpoints in the high-security Green Zone, demanding the ouster of US troops from Iraq and voicing loyalty to a powerful Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.

US President Donald Trump blamed Tehran and warned that it would face punishment if Americans are killed.

""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,"" Trump said on Twitter late Tuesday.

""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,"" wrote Trump, adding ""Happy New Year!""

- Surprise, fury -

The message came at the end of a day in which Washington officials appeared surprised and furious over the ease at which the protestors entered the Green Zone, reaching the US embassy compound for the first time in years.

They carried flags of the hardline Kataeb Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades), a component of the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network.

As live broadcasts showed the protestors battering down the high-security doors of the embassy reception building, smashing windows and burning a sentry box, the State Department and Pentagon demanded Iraq's leaders provide security to the compound -- which was already heavily fortified.

In phone calls with both Iraqi caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and President Barham Saleh, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ""made clear the United States will protect and defend its people, who are there to support a sovereign and independent Iraq,"" the State Department said.

Hours later a contingent of US Marines flew in from Kuwait, by which time some of the demonstrators had receded and others settled in for a sustained protest, preparing food for the evening.

Trump directly blamed Iran for ""orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq.""

""They will be held fully responsible,"" he said.

Tehran countered that the United States is itself to blame for air strikes that killed about two dozen Kataeb Hezbollah fighters on Sunday.

""The surprising audacity of American officials is so much that after killing at least 25... and violating the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, that now... they attribute the Iraqi people's protest against their cruel acts to the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi.

- 'Strategic patience' -

The mob attack put a focus on the strains in the US-Iraqi relationship. Allies of Iran, which enjoys significant support in parts of the Iraqi government, increasingly challenge Washington's influence in the country.

US jet fighters on Sunday struck five Kateab Hezbollah outposts in Iraq and Syria after a series of rocket attacks on US-occupied facilities in Iraq over the past two months that are blamed on the group and its alleged Iranian sponsors.

One of those attacks, in Kirkuk on Friday, left an American civilian contractor dead and exhausted what US officials called Trump's ""strategic patience"" with Tehran.

""The president has shown a lot of restraint,"" Brian Hook, the State Department's Special Representative for Iran, told reporters Monday.

""We very much hoped that Iran would not miscalculate and confuse our restraint for weakness. But after so many attacks, it was important for the president to direct our armed forces to respond in a way that the Iranian regime will understand.""

- 'First lesson' to US -

But it added to the growing calls by some political factions in Iraq to push US troops out of the country nearly 17 years after they entered and overthrew Saddam Hussein's regime.

Dozens of Iraqi lawmakers have called for a review of the agreement allowing about 5,200 US troops in Iraq, saying the airstrikes over the weekend violated the country's sovereignty.

An Iraqi government statement said the attacks ""force Iraq to review its relations and its security, political and legal framework to protect its sovereignty"".

The protesters who besieged the US embassy on Tuesday carried posters reading: ""Parliament should oust US troops, or else we will!""

Late Tuesday Kataeb Hezbollah hailed the protest outside as a ""first lesson"" to Washington, ""so that Trump knows he did something extremely stupid"".

""This may well be the low point of US policy in Iraq,"" said Iraq expert Fanar Haddad of Singapore University's Middle East Institute.

- No evacuation plans -

But US officials said there were no plans to evacuate the mission, and no US personnel were reported injured. Ambassador Matthew Tueller, who had been on holiday leave, was on his way back to the embassy.

During the day Trump also called Abdel Madi to emphasise the need to protect US personnel and facilities in Iraq, the White House said.

He later tweeted his thanks to Abdel Mahdi and Saleh for ""their rapid response upon request"" to the embassy attack.

The United States said Tuesday it is sending hundreds more troops to the Middle East after a mob of pro-Iranian demonstrators stormed its embassy compound in Iraq, setting fires and chanting ""Death to America!""

Angered by US air strikes that killed two dozen paramilitary fighters on Sunday, hundreds of protesters spilled through checkpoints in the high-security Green Zone Tuesday, demanding the ouster of American troops from Iraq and voicing loyalty to a powerful Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attack was ""orchestrated by terrorists,"" one of whom he named as Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Muhandis has been identified as second-in-command of the Tehran-backed Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary group which includes Kataeb Hezbollah, the group that was targeted in the US air strikes.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a statement that around 750 troops from a rapid response unit of the 82nd Airborne Division are prepared to deploy over the next several days to the region.

""This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,"" he said.

The US had already flown a rapid response team of Marines into Baghdad to reinforce its embassy after the attack Tuesday, which left smoke and flames rising from the embassy entrance and further heightened tension between Tehran and Washington.

Esper's announcement is the latest move by Washington to step up its defenses in the region since US President Donald Trump in May 2018 pulled out of a multinational nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed crippling economic sanctions.

Trump blamed Tehran for the embassy attack and warned that it would face punishment if Americans are killed.

""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,"" Trump said on Twitter.

""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,"" wrote Trump, adding ""Happy New Year!""

Just prior to Esper's announcement a US official had told AFP that Washington had already deployed hundreds of American troops to Kuwait in response to the unrest, and they would likely to be sent on to Iraq.

""At least 500 members of the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division have left Fort Bragg in the US, and up to 4,000 may ultimately be deployed,"" the official said.

- Surprise, fury -

Trump's message came at the end of a day in which Washington officials appeared surprised and furious over the ease at which the protestors entered the Green Zone, reaching the US embassy compound for the first time in years.

They carried flags of the hardline Kataeb Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades), a component of the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network.

Live broadcasts showed the protesters battering down the high-security doors of the embassy reception building, smashing windows and burning a sentry box.

The State Department and Pentagon demanded Iraq's leaders provide security to the compound -- which was already heavily fortified.

By the time a contingent of US Marine reinforcements flew in, some of the demonstrators had receded and others settled in for a sustained protest, preparing food for the evening.

Tehran said the United States is itself to blame for air strikes that killed about two dozen Kataeb Hezbollah fighters on Sunday.

""The surprising audacity of American officials is so much that after killing at least 25... and violating the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, that now... they attribute the Iraqi people's protest against their cruel acts to the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi.

- 'Strategic patience' -

The mob attack put a focus on the strains in the US-Iraqi relationship. Allies of Iran, which enjoys significant support in parts of the Iraqi government, increasingly challenge Washington's influence in the country.

US jet fighters on Sunday struck five Kateab Hezbollah outposts in Iraq and Syria after a series of rocket attacks on US-occupied facilities in Iraq over the past two months that are blamed on the group and its alleged Iranian sponsors.

One of those attacks, in Kirkuk on Friday, left an American civilian contractor dead and exhausted what US officials called Trump's ""strategic patience"" with Tehran.

- 'First lesson' to US -

It also added to the growing calls by some political factions in Iraq to push US troops out of the country nearly 17 years after they entered and overthrew Saddam Hussein's regime.

The protesters who besieged the US embassy on Tuesday carried posters reading: ""Parliament should oust US troops, or else we will!""

Late Tuesday Kataeb Hezbollah hailed the attack as a ""first lesson"" to Washington, ""so that Trump knows he did something extremely stupid"".

US officials said there were no plans to evacuate the mission, and no US personnel were reported injured. Ambassador Matthew Tueller, who had been on holiday leave, was on his way back to the embassy.

19156,5ed05c63864e41e2583c1835f9cac879,"Seoul: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared an end to moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon.

Analysts said the announcement, reported by state media on Wednesday, amounted to Kim putting a missile ""to Donald Trump's head"" -- but warned that escalation by Pyongyang would probably backfire.

Washington was swift to respond, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Kim to ""take a different course"" and stressing that the US wanted ""peace not confrontation"" with the North, while Trump played down the development.

Pyongyang has previously fired missiles capable of reaching the entire US mainland, and has carried out six nuclear tests, the last of them 16 times more powerful than the Hiroshima blast, according to the highest estimates.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been a centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and the US president, but little tangible progress.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's ""promise"" to him not to carry them out, and has downplayed launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February. The North set the US an end-of-2019 deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a ""new way"".

""There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,"" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim as telling top ruling party officials.

""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" he added, referring to the North by its official name.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party was an indication of a major policy shift.

State television showed veteran newsreader Ri Chun Hee reading out the KCNA dispatch over footage of Kim addressing the officials and general imagery of the country.

The broadcast appeared to stand in place of Kim's usual New Year speech -- normally a key moment in the North Korean political calendar.

Kim acknowledged the impact of international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programmes, but made clear that the North was willing to pay the price to preserve its nuclear capability.

""The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,"" KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had ""conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop"" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said.

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it take more tangible steps towards giving them up.

""North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump's head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,"" said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

""Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,"" he added.

The strategy was risky, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with ""more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account"".

Kim's moratorium comments were ""ominous"", said Leif-Eric Easley of Ewha University in Seoul, but added that he could be looking to ""elicit concessions by approaching Trump's red line without crossing it"".

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carries out a long-range missile test.

Speaking to Fox News and CBS after Kim's announcement, Pompeo said a resumption of nuclear and missile tests would be ""deeply disappointing"".

""We hope that Chairman Kim will take a different course... that he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,"" Pompeo said.

""We want peace, not confrontation,"" he added, with Seoul's unification ministry adding that a strategic weapon test ""would not help denuclearisation negotiations"".

Trump himself was emollient, saying that he thought Kim was ""a man of his word"" and that at their Singapore summit, ""we did sign a contract, talking about denuclearisation"".

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern over North Korea's announcement and ""very much hopes that the tests will not resume,"" his spokesman said.

""Non-proliferation remains a fundamental pillar of global nuclear security,"" he added.

An ICBM launch would be likely to frustrate China, the North's key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own back yard. (AFP)"," Threaten, not specified below",3

A pledge to plant a tree in Nepal and Indonesia for every vote submitted has resulted in a substantial commitment to help tackle climate change in projects around the world.

The campaign will result in the planting of 10 million trees, including mangroves and tropical rainforests to promote food security, protect biodiversity and safeguard communities most vulnerable to climate change.

Votes were cast on three logos displayed on the UAE Nation Brand's official website designed by 49 Emirati artists.

The logos are titled: 'Emirates in Calligraphy', 'The Palm' and '7 Lines’.

“The unique call to global audiences reinforces the humanitarian and global aspect that distinguishes the UAE and reflect its deeply-rooted values of openness, coexistence and tolerance,” a statement published on state news agency Wam said.

The UAE will focus on planting millions of trees in Numfoor Island, one of the most disadvantaged areas of Indonesia where subsistence farmers and fishers make up approximately 75 per cent of the population.

West Papua, Indonesia, situated in the Coral Triangle, is an area recognised as the global centre of marine biodiversity and a global priority for conservation because of the broad range of species it supports, including at least 500 species of reef-building corals.

In Nepal, the UAE will plant millions of mangroves at the Amaltaari planting site in Nawalparasi, home to endangered species including leopards and the elusive Bengal tiger.

The tree plantations are expected to empower thousands of local people, mostly farmers, and improve their lives.

UAE residents were able to submit their votes at shopping malls across the country, including Yas Mall in Abu Dhabi, Global Village and City Walk in Dubai, City Centre Sharjah and Matajer Sharjah, City Centre Ajman, City Centre Ras Al Khaimah and City Centre Fujairah.

The campaign was announced by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai, and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, in November.

Iran Press TV

Wednesday, 01 January 2020 2:03 PM

The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says Russian surface-to-air missile systems have managed to foil an attack by foreign-sponsored Takfiri militants against the strategic Hmeimim airbase in Syria's western coastal province of Latakia.

The Britain-based war monitor said several explosions were heard in the city of Jableh, located 25 kilometers (16 miles) south of Latakia, early on Wednesday as militants launched projectiles at the military facility.

None of the projectiles struck the site as Russian systems intercepted and shot them down.

Back on December 23, the Observatory reported several loud booms in the vicinity of Jableh.

Local sources, requesting not to be named, said they were the sounds of Russian air defense systems, which targeted unmanned aerial vehicles as they were flying over the area.

Car bomb kills 3 in Turkish-controlled northern Syrian town

At least three people lost their lives and four others sustained injuries when a car rigged with explosives went off in an area of Syria's northern province of Raqqah, controlled by Turkish military forces and their allied militants ever since they launched a ground offensive against militants from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG).

Syria's official news agency SANA said the attack took place on Wednesday in the village of Suluk, which is located in the Tal Abyad district of the province.

There was no immediate claim for the act of terror.

A car bomb killed at least eight civilians, including a woman and a child, and wounded 21 others in the same Syrian village on December 23.

On October 9, Turkish military forces and Ankara-backed militants launched a long-threatened cross-border invasion of northeastern Syria in a declared attempt to push YPG militants away from border areas.

Ankara views the US-backed YPG as a terrorist organization tied to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been seeking an autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey since 1984.

On October 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed a memorandum of understanding that asserted YPG militants had to withdraw from the Turkish-controlled ""safe zone"" in northeastern Syria within 150 hours, after which Ankara and Moscow would run joint patrols around the area.

The announcement was made hours before a US-brokered five-day truce between Turkish and Kurdish-led forces was due to expire.

Iran Press TV

Wednesday, 01 January 2020 5:54 AM

US Army soldiers have been banned from using the hugely popular short video app TikTok over a security threat, according to an Army spokeswoman.

The decision to ban the Chinese-owned app was made following the lead of the Navy and guidance from the Defense Department, the spokeswoman said on Tuesday.

""There was a Cyber Awareness Message sent out on 16 December identifies TikTok as having potential security risks associated with its use,"" Army spokesperson Lt. Col Robin L. Ochoa told CNN.

""The message directs appropriate action for employees to take in order to safeguard their personal information. The guidance is to be wary of applications you download, monitor your phones for unusual and unsolicited texts etc., and delete them immediately and uninstall TikTok to circumvent any exposure of personal information.""

""It is considered a cyber threat,"" Ochoa told Military.com. ""We do not allow it on government phones.""

Last month, the Navy banned the app, owned by the China-based tech company ByteDance, from government-issued mobile devices, saying it represented a ""cybersecurity threat.""

In October, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a member of the Armed Services and Intelligence committees, sent a letter to acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire, asking him to assess TikTok and other China-based companies for potential security risks.

The lawmakers argued that because ByteDance is based in China, TikTok could be forced ""to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.""

TikTok responded with a statement, saying, ""Our data centers are located entirely outside of China, and none of our data is subject to Chinese law.""

""Further, we have a dedicated technical team focused on adhering to robust cybersecurity policies, and data privacy and security practices.""

The US military had been using the app as a tool to recruit and a way to reach young people, but it started to discourage personnel from using it in mid-December, according to Military.com.

Military personnel are allowed to use the app on their personal devices, but the Pentagon has warned that those using the app in their private lives to be cautious.

KABUL (Sputnik) - Taliban militants have attacked a police checkpoint in the northern Afghan province of Balkh, leaving eight people dead and three others injured, Balkh Police Chief Ajmal Fayez said on Wednesday.

Fayez stated that a group of Taliban insurgents had attacked and seized control of a police checkpoint on the Mazari Sharif – Sheberghan highway for a short period of time overnight Tuesday and were soon repelled from the area.

According to Afghan media, citing local officials, the Taliban had a mole among the checkpoint's 14 officers who helped carry out the attack. The movement, however, has not yet addressed the incident.

Tensions in the country continue to escalate despite talks between the Taliban and American officials, relaunched after a 3-month break. The previous year-long series of negotiations had seemingly reached a point where it looked like an agreement would be signed, but the talks were halted after the death of a US soldier in a Taliban attack.

At the moment, the movement is ready to conclude a ceasefire accord to work on a peace deal that envisages the withdrawal of the US-led coalition forces after an 18-year campaign in exchange for security guarantees from the Taliban.

LUANDA, Angola, Jan 2 – An Angolan court, acting in a graft investigation, has frozen bank accounts held by Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of former president Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the public prosecutor said.

Dos Santos – who has been nicknamed Africa’s wealthiest woman – is being investigated with her husband Sindika Dokolo in a corruption affair involving more than a billion dollars (euros), it said in a statement issued late Monday.

The probe is looking at alleged irregularities involving state companies, including the oil giant Sonangol which Isabel dos Santos used to run, and a diamond-marketing firm, Sodiam.

A tribunal in the capital Luanda, in a decision issued on December 23, ordered bank accounts held by the couple to be frozen.

Their holdings in several Angolan companies, including the telecoms firm Unitel and cement company Cimangola, have also been frozen, the statement said.

The court’s decision also applies to a Portuguese businessman, Mario da Silva.

In a tweet, Isabel dos Santos, 46, said she sent “a message of tranquility and confidence to my teams.”

“We will continue, every day, in every business, doing our best and fighting for what I believe in for Angola. The road is long, the truth will prevail. United we stand strong,” she said.

She was appointed head of Sonangol in 2016 but was forced out the following year, in one of the first major acts undertaken by her father’s successor, Joao Lourenco.

She has since left Angola – like most members of the Dos Santos family – because she claims she has faced death threats.

Jose Eduardo dos Santos ruled Angola for 38 years – a time widely associated with corruption and nepotism.

His family accuses Lourenco’s government of persecution.

The former president’s son, Jose Filomeno dos Santos, 41, who is Isabel dos Santos’s half-brother, went on trial in early December for alleged corruption.

He is accused of embezzling as much as $1.5 billion from Angola’s sovereign wealth fund during his 2013-2018 stewardship.

Despite extensive oil, gas and mineral reserves, the majority of Angolans live in poverty and continue to rely on subsistence agriculture."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Although Mr Johnson has a strong mandate for his Brexit deal, Northern Ireland chamber of commerce president John Healy said it does not represent the “end” of the matter, rather it was “only the beginning of a process”.

Mr Healy, who is also vice-president and managing director of tech giant Allstate Northern Ireland, which employs 2,300, said businesses urgently require “clear, detailed information” to be best prepared for the changes which lie ahead.

“The incoming government must still act to avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the European Union,” Mr Healy warned.

‘Stagnant economy’

He fears the combination of ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the lack of an executive at Stormont will result in a further deterioration in the local economy in the coming months.

“Businesses need to see immediate, substantial action to reinvigorate our stagnant economy, build new infrastructure, boost skills and lower the cost of doing business in 2020.

“We need an end to vague pronouncements, and a renewed focus on the details that matter,” Mr Healy urged.

By RFE/RL January 01, 2020

The U.S. and German ambassadors to Poland have taken to social media to defend Warsaw in its spat with Russia over who was to blame for starting World War II.

German envoy Rolf Nikel and U.S. Ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher both said on December 30 that Germany and the Soviet Union colluded to start the war in 1939 that led to the death of tens of millions of people on continental Europe.

""Dear President [Vladimir] Putin,"" Mosbacher said, Adolf Hitler of Germany and Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union ""colluded to start WWII.""

She said, ""that is a fact"" and that ""Poland was a victim of this horrible conflict.""

Nikel said his government's position was clear: ""the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact served to prepare the criminal invasion of Nazi Germany against Poland. The USSR together with Germany participated in this brutal division of Poland.""

Their statements on social-media came after Putin blamed Poland for provoking the start of the war in which 6 million Poles were killed, or 17 percent of the country's pre-war population.

The Soviet Union suffered an estimated 20 million war deaths, half of whom were civilians, representing some 11 percent of its population.

The verbal brawl over the competing historical narratives reignited on December 19 when Putin at a news conference denied that the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union was sealed in preparation for war.

EU Resolution

Earlier, in September, he denounced a European Parliament resolution that concluded the Soviet Union bore partial responsibility for WWII, alongside Germany.

The EU resolution said the pact set out to divide Europe ""between the two totalitarian regimes"" of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

Putin dismissed the resolution as ""sheer nonsense.""

Instead the Russian president said Poland was culpable for the outbreak of World War II, words that Russia's Foreign Ministry also repeated in December.

In response, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki issued a four-page statement accusing Putin of ""deliberately"" lying about the start of WWII in an effort to deflect international pressure over Moscow's actions, both domestic and foreign.

""President Putin has lied about Poland on numerous occasions, and he has always done it deliberately,"" Morawiecki said. ""It usually happens in a situation when the authorities in Moscow feel international pressure caused by its actions. And this pressure is not on the historical stage but on the modern geopolitical scene.""

This year in May, Russia will celebrate the 75th anniversary of victory in WWII in events that are expected to feature much fanfare with heads of state and other dignitaries in attendance.

The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, which has been fighting for the merger of 800 odd villages with Maharashtra, had recently submitted a memorandum of their demands to Uddhav Thackeray.

Maharashtra claims the border district of Belagavi was part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, but is currently a district of Karnataka, on linguistic grounds.

Savadi, who hails from Belagavi, said the Maharashtra Chief Minister would do well to recall what his cousin Raj Thackeray had said in the past on the matter.

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray had said in October 2014 in Mumbai politicians from the state have never been serious about finding a solution to the dispute and the issue has always been used for politics.

The MNS chief had recalled that when MEK members had met him a few years ago, he had said he was prepared, if required, to meet the then Karnataka chief minister to discuss the issue and demand that there should not be injustice on Marathi speaking people living in Belgaum and nearby areas.

In response to the massive protests in Iraq following the latest U.S. aerial assault that killed scores of Iraqis, Donald Trump has ordered 750 more U.S. troops to the Middle East and potentially 3,000 more. This is in addition to the 5,200 U.S. troops already stationed in Iraq. Every U.S. president over the last 28 years has ordered the bombing of Iraq. The decision by Donald Trump and the Pentagon to launch new air assaults against Iraqis in the past week ignited nationwide resistance by Iraqis who want to reclaim their full sovereignty and do not want Iraq to be used in a U.S. war on Iran.

More than a million Iraqis have died during the past 28 years as a consequence of U.S. occupation, bombings and sanctions. Tens of thousands of U.S. troops have either been killed or suffered life-changing wounds. The U.S. government has spent more than $3 trillion dollars in the on-going occupation and bombing of this oil-rich country. Instead of taking the United States out of this endless war, Trump is building up U.S. forces in the region and threatening a war with Iran.

Initiators for this call include the ANSWER Coalition, CODEPINK, Popular Resistance, Veterans For Peace, World Beyond War, Voices for Creative Nonviolence, and many other anti-war and peace organizations.

Five New York City firefighters were injured fighting a blaze early Wednesday inside a Manhattan high-rise. Officials say one of the firefighters received serious injuries while the others received minor injuries. A civilian was also wounded in the fire. The fire was reported after 12:30 a.m. on the 14th floor of an apartment building on East 79th Street. More than 100 firefighters responded to the Upper East Side residence. The blaze was under control by 2:30 a.m. Officials say the cause of the fire remains under investigation."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
20022,25a57af06b42c095493be8d4d5c30d68,"Francis apologised Wednesday for the flash of anger — or self-defense — that he exhibited while greeting the faithful around the Vatican’s giant Nativity scene after a New Year’s Eve liturgy the evening before.

“Many times we lose our patience,” he said. “I do, too, and I’m sorry for yesterday’s bad example.”

In an incident captured on video and spread across the internet, Francis can be seen reaching into the crowd and seeking the hands of children. As he turns away, a woman in the crowd grabs his right hand with both of her hands and yanks the 83-year-old pope back, causing him to momentarily lose his balance. Francis, visibly upset, slaps twice at the woman’s hands to free himself, rebuking her, and then angrily turns away.

In his traditional Wednesday remarks, the pontiff ruminated on patience and how it conquers “iniquity and power.”

This is not the first time the world has focused on papal handshakes gone awry. In March, Francis repeatedly withdrew his hand from worshippers as they sought to kiss his ring. Video of that receiving line also circulated widely, and it became material for jokes on late-night talk shows. It was also a source of consternation for conservatives, many of whom dislike Francis and called the video disturbing evidence of the pope’s breaking with tradition and ritual.

The Vatican said at the time that the pope’s motivation for yanking his hand back was itself viral. “It was a simple question of hygiene,” said Alessandro Gisotti, who was then the Vatican’s chief spokesman.

On the papal plane later that month, a reporter jokingly withdrew his hand as Francis sought to shake it, prompting a good-humoured explanation from Francis that he had simply been looking out for people’s health."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The customer was working on his computer Tuesday morning when a suspect snatched the device and ran. The suspect then drove off in a nearby vehicle, authorities said.

It was unclear whether there was a driver waiting in the vehicle, authorities said.

Before the car drove off, witnesses said the customer grabbed a door handle, causing him to slam his head into a parked car when the vehicle accelerated away. Authorities did not immediately confirm the witness accounts.

“He was bleeding only from the head. His face was purple and blue,” said Maria Chan, a florist shop owner across the street.

from SAAD MUSE in Mogadishu, Somalia

MOGADISHU, (CAJ News) – SOME victims of the recent terror attack in Somali have been flown overseas for treatment. This highlights the gravity of the bomb blast that left over 90 people dead.

Local doctors are facing an influx of the injured seeking treatment for severe injuries.

More than 140 people, among them children and university students, were injured in the bomb blast in Mogadishu last weekend.

The International Committee of the Red Cross disclosed it had done 52 surgeries since Saturday and was hoping most of the patients pulled through.

“Four of the patients have been referred to Turkey for further treatment,” said Dr Mohamed Yusuf Hassan, director of Medina Hospital, which the ICRC supports year-round.

Noor Abdikarim Ali, team leader of the Somali Red Crescent Society’s First Aid Action team, relived the horror of this past weekend’s attack.

“I saw women and children dead and body parts strewn all over the street. We transported almost 70 dead bodies,” Ali said.

The attack claimed by the Islamist Al-Shabaab group is one of the deadliest in recent years.

It evoked the horror of the twin blasts that killed nearly 580 people in central Mogadishu in October 2017.

The terror group has an estimated troops strength of between 7 000 and 9 000. It has been active in Somalia since 2006.

20214,15af37cda5d3fbb3919bbeb6c896254a,"‘Pioneer’, ‘trailblazer’, ‘dynamic’, ‘tenacious’, ‘a beautiful friend and mentor’…..these are just some of the words used to describe journalist, editor and publisher Barbara Campbell since the news of her passing was announced on social media on the evening of December 29.

Since the announcement of the tragic news, friends, former colleagues and others who knew her have flocked to pay tribute to a woman who played such an important role in shining a positive media spotlight on stories affecting the black community during a time when they were virtually ignored by the mainstream media.

Campbell has also been praised for work in mentoring and supporting many young journalists who have gone on to successful careers in the media.

After joining The Voice in 1994 and becoming editor of the publication’s sister paper, The Weekly Journal (later called The Journal) Campbell achieved prominence when she went on to launch the bi monthly magazine Live Listings in 1999, described as a multicultural version of Time Out through her company Barbwire Enterprises.

In 2003 she achieved another publishing first with the launch of Britain’s first Black History Month magazine, Black Heritage Today.

Campbell also developed International Black Women’s Month Magazine, an official guide which helped to consolidate the month in the UK.

‘SHE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT HER WORK AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY‘

Former colleague Denise Dixon Roberts who worked with her on Black Out magazine, which was launched before Live Listings, spoke of the qualities that made Campbell a successful editor, publisher and passionate campaigner for the black community.

PASSIONATE: Barbara Campbell as a a young reporter with The Voice in the early 90s

She told The Voice: “She played a significant role in our industry and was passionate about her work and the black community, of course, helping to provide opportunities for those coming behind her. She was certainly significant in my career. I worked with her on Black Out. Later I also wrote content for Black Heritage Today. I remember going to editorial meetings at Barbara’s flat in south London where she wore the hats of the editor, publisher and advertising executive.”

Roberts continues: “She was a straight-talking yet bubbly person. I have this memory of Barbara writing to one of the mainstream international women’s magazines who were looking for an editor. She wrote a bold letter challenging them to break protocol and by hiring their first black editor, but of course they didn’t reply. Barbara wanted to see change. Sad to see that she is no longer with us.”

Journalist and lecturer Vivienne Francis agrees. Francis worked with Campbell during her time as a reporter and editor on The Weekly Journal, The Voice’s sister paper.

‘IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGET THE WARMTH OF HER SMILE’

Francis recalls: “I first met Barbara when we both worked as young, fresh-faced news reporters at the Weekly Journal in the mid 1990s. Although we haven’t been in touch for many years, it’s impossible to forget the warmth that her smile and strong character brought to The Voice’s offices.

TRAILBLAZER: Campbell went on to set up her own publishing company

“As journalists, we sought to elevate the issues, concerns and achievements of Britain’s black communities with impartiality and integrity. Barbara’s work achieved this. She had a deep understanding of the communities that she reported on and the issues that needed to be scrutinized. Her personality and reputation also ensured that she always had good access to the voices that needed to be heard. All of this translated into stories that brought originality and authenticity to The Journal.”

Another writer whose life and work was strongly influenced by Campbell is Monika Ribeiro.

She says: “Barbara Campbell trained me as a journalist while I was freelancing for Black Heritage Today and International Women’s Month magazines. She taught me how to write feature articles, conduct journalistic interviews, research and more. She welcomed me into her home and heart as well.

“I remember proudly presenting my first feature to her. It was embellished – quite “flowery”. She cut so much out. I got upset thinking she took my soul out of the piece. I then showed it to my friend who had read the original. She didn’t hesitate to tell me that Barbara’s pen made it better. So, I decided to stop mourning my style and started paying attention.

‘HER HEART BLED FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY’

“Barbara knew exactly what she wanted to say and how she wanted to say it. Her heart bled for the black community and for black stories to be told the RIGHT WAY. I could see a flame in her eyes when she spoke about how much the community needed positive role models and narratives. That passion drove her and made her fight tirelessly against financial, physical and all other odds. It was tough on her, especially towards the end. Sometimes, I think she sacrificed her life for it.”

Speaking about the lasting impact that Campbell had on her life, Ribeiro says:

“These few words are not enough to summarise the impact she made on me as a writer. When I decided not to pursue journalism, she encouraged my poetry and gave me a poet’s corner in Black Heritage Today. In one of her recommendations, she said ‘…Anytime, she is performing l hope to be there – cheering from the front!’ Sadly, she never made it to my shows, but I still hear her voice in my head reminding me to use the word ‘reportedly’ just in case… I edit my stories the way she taught me. Her heart and skills are part of my writing. She was an excellent journalist, editor, boss lady, teacher and friend…

“My heart broke when she got ill, and each time I visited her after that. She should still be here, but I thank God for the gift of knowing her. I’m also grateful for the opportunity to have been there in the last years and days of her life. Babs, thank you! You are cheering me and many others on even after you’re gone. You left so many beautiful footprints in the sand. We know you were here. R.I.P. Lady B.”

INNOVATIVE: How the media covered the launch of one of Campbell’s publishing ventures

‘BABS TAUGHT ME HOW TO CANVAS A BLANK PAGE’

Another person whose life and work Campbell had a huge influence on is Winsome Duncan aka Lyrical.

She recalls: “Babs taught me how to canvas a blank page. She guided me on how to caress the pen. I unearthed the gift God gave me to tell a fragrant story as she lovingly watched on, whilst helping me shape and chizzle my words out of the fire into print.

“I am a solid writer because she poured into me her wealth of industry knowledge. We worked quite closely together and it was exciting times in her office with the radio switched on and our usual sing-a-long. She was constantly vibrant and had a fierce passion for the black community, arts and culture.

“I was at Barbara’s bedside in the last couple of days of her life and she still had a fighting, winning spirit. We walked the journey together as she became unwell and would confide in me her innermost thoughts. We had some beautiful moments together.

“Ms Campbell was my friend, a mentor and a board member for my social enterprise MPLOYME. I learned the value of unconditional friendship and grace in her presence. When you have someone rooting for you in all your endeavours, like a buried seed, you must push up through the soil, sprout your wings and fly.

“Barbara Campbell was that sister in the background always championing you on to win and I will always love her for that. I am honoured to spend time with this beautiful soul through the hill and gully. Rest in peace Babs, see you when I get there. My love always.”

FRIEND AND MENTOR: Campbell with Winsome Duncan who she worked with on a number of projects (pic: Winsome Duncan)

Other tributes have highlighted Campbell’s resilience as the publisher behind Live Listings and Black Heritage Today magazines.

The publications were launched at a time when the financial hurdles faced by black publishers and media businesses were particularly steep.

And there are many who praised Campbell’s willingness to keep moving forward despite not getting the financial backing or recognition they felt she deserved.

‘SHE WAS A DYNAMIC ENGAGING PERSON….BUT SHE ALSO TOOK NO PRISONERS’

Patrick Vernon OBE, founder of 100 Great Black Britons site worked with Campbell and witnessed the challenges that black publishers faced in the 1990s and 2000s.

“She was a dynamic, feisty, engaging person with a wicked sense of humour and loved her reggae and lovers rock” he recalls. “But at the same time, she took no prisoners. It is no coincidence that she chose the name ‘Barbwire’ as the name of her company. It was not just a play on words. It reflected her steely will, tenacity, determination to fight for her business as she tried to provide a service to the community and sustain her family.

“Despite all the opportunities around advertising and sponsorship as black history was becoming more fashionable and acceptable, she had to work 10 times as hard as a woman in a male-dominated world.

“She often would be working around the clock in her flat in Battersea editing, pitching for business and raising her two young children Leanna and Layton. It was always struggle when it came to publication deadlines in meeting the costs of printing her magazines. However, she still managed to get her magazines out no matter what.”

‘BARBARA’S LEGACY NEEDS FURTHER CELEBRATION’

Vernon continues: “In many ways the impact of a running a small business with very little support has an impact on your physical and mental wellbeing. Although she enjoyed going out, church, singing and being with her children and children the years of stress and pressure took its toll in the end.

“Barbara’s legacy to the Black British publishing needs further documentation and celebration. She was a modern version of Claudia Jones in using her publication to educate, inform and inspire the community.”

POSITIVE MEDIA IMAGES: Barbara Campbell’s first editorial for Black Out magazine

Paying tribute to her tenacity as a publisher radio presenter and Voice columnist Dotun Adebayo said: “My abiding memory of Barbara Campbell is that you could never keep this good woman down. She got knocked down so many times in her efforts to “be” somebody but she bounced right back with her cup always half full, if not brimming over with love, ideas and enthusiasm.

‘She didn’t need the establishment’s approval. She was a self-made publishing mogul.’



“Of course she was somebody. She didn’t need the establishment’s approval or acknowledgment. She was a self-made publishing mogul who presided over a magazine empire that she invested her energy and determination into and no small amount of personal wealth. Every time I saw her she was on another entrepreneurial publishing venture, the details of which she laid out for me with that illuminating half-smile that seemed to say, ‘You t’ink me did done? Me jus’ ah come man, me jus’ a come.’



We are all the poorer for the loss of this amazing woman.”

Entrepreneur and community activist Dr Jak Buela said: “The quality of her magazines were unparalleled, covering articles and featuring many people who owe her a debt of gratitude for providing a spotlight on their work – including me. Despite being a pioneer or because of it, she eventually found that others with more resources than her entering the field. This obviously took its toll.

SUPPORTIVE: Campbell with Monika Ribeiro, another young writer she mentored

‘SHE WAS A PIONEER, A TRAILBLAZER WHO WORKED TIRELESSLY FOR THE COMMUNITY’

“A remarkable pioneer of UK magazine publishing – the likes of which we are unlikely to see again. RIEP my dear sister Barbara, those of us who knew you, know exactly how much of a trailblazer you were.”

Speaking about how Campbell dealt with the challenges of the publishing industry journalist and broadcaster Henry Bonsu said: “I have nothing but admiration for Barbara and what she achieved. After editing he Journal she could have just become another jobbing freelance but she didn’t. She struck out on her own, rode the challenges that have sunk other media companies in our community and created a platform that took Black History Month to a new level.

‘HER PLACE IN BLACK BRITISH MEDIA HISTORY IS ASSURED’

“And somehow she did it with a broad smile – at least whenever I saw her – even though she must have been dealing with all kinds of advertising and funding crises. Barbara has gone too soon but her place in the annals of black British media history is assured.”

Keysha Davis, a journalist who worked with Campbell on Live Listings and Black Heritage Today added: “Publishing is a notoriously male dominated industry, but undeterred, Barbara would continually forge ahead self-publishing magazines and periodicals with often limited resources producing stellar results.

IMPORTANT LEGACY: Campbell was passionate about supporting the black community

“She was a pioneer, trailblazer and renaissance woman who worked tirelessly to support and celebrate the Black British community she cared so greatly for. I am so thankful for the help and guidance she granted me. May her soul rest in perfect peace.”

After breaking off her engagement with Christian Carino in 2018, some whirlwind rumors about her relationship with co-star Bradley Cooper in ""A Star is Born,"" and a brief fling with sound engineer Dan Horton last summer, Ldy Gaga has found someone to kiss on New Year's Eve.

The 33-year-old Grammy winner celebrated the New Year in Las Vegas with a special concert performance inside the Park Theater at Park MGM.

After she performed her show ""Jazz & Piano,"" she took off to head to NoMad Restaurant at Brian Newman's ""After Dark"" show where she sang ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and danced with Newman's wife, Angie Pontani.

In a Twitter video shared by a Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist, Lady Gaga was seen kissing a mystery man at the stroke of midnight.

The Journal mentioned that the man's first name is Michael. Lady Gaga can be seen wearing a gold sequin gown with dark lipstick and a pink bubblegum wig.

As for Michael, he wore a black, untucked button-down shirt, jeans, and black sneakers.

Lady Gaga Spotted Kissing & Holding Hands With Mystery Man 10 Months After Split From Fiancé https://t.co/S7lmFnBNdF pic.twitter.com/t8wSgZErLt — peter alexander (@carribablue) January 1, 2020

According to the video spreading on social media, they left the venue holding hands. Gaga did not appear to be trying to hide her affection for her date.

TMZ also reported this but has no additional information about the man, but they were sure to say that he was not Bradley Cooper.

Lady Gaga's Recent Love Life

The speculation about Lady Gaga and Cooper began after last year's performance of ""Shallow"" at the Oscars. The two got pretty steamy onstage as they sang the famous duet song from their 2018 film ""A Star is Born"" -- one that prompted fans to wonder if something else was really going on between them.

Speaking to Oprah Winfrey last December, there was a story behind that romantic show. The chemistry was not fake, but it also did not mean that she and Cooper were together.

""Quite frankly, I think that the press is ridiculous. We made a love story. For me, as a performer and as an actress, of course, we wanted people to believe that we were in love. And we wanted people to feel that love at the Oscars. We wanted it to go right and through that lens of that camera and to every TV that it was being watched on.""

Lady Gaga also admitted that they worked hard on it for days and have ""mapped the whole thing out -- it was orchestrated as a performance.""

On the other hand, Lady Gaga's relationship with Dan Horton was a disaster, according to Us Weekly.

After being spotted all around LA, they worked closely at a home studio in Hollywood, and sparks just started flying.

""They seem like a pretty good match.""

Unfortunately, the sound engineer could not keep up with his famous girlfriend.

The pair went their separate ways and, as told by an Us Weekly insider, ""Dan was not mature enough for her. Gaga does want to date again.""

Lady Gaga's last two relationships were high profile. So maybe someone with a more low-key career and life would be a better fit for her.

Pope Francis, 83, was visibly annoyed after breaking free of the unidentified woman's grip, after smiling while greeting the people before he reached her. It's rare for this pope to show annoyance, though he angrily reprimanded somebody for being ""selfish"" after he was pulled off balance onto a person in a wheelchair during a 2016 trip to Mexico, The Washington Post recalled. The pope's New Year's Day message at the Vatican included a denunciation of violence against women, from rape and forced prostitution to verbal abuse. ""We can understand our degree of humanity by how we treat a woman's body,"" he said.

The young man died following a double shooting in Regent Park late on New Year’s Day.

Police were called to the area of River and Oak streets at 10:30 p.m. for reports of multiple gunshots.

They found Yakot with life-threatening injuries and another man, also 21, with serious, but not critical, injuries. Both men were rushed to hospital, where Yakot died.

Police say the two men were shot at by suspects in a dark-coloured sedan that fled the scene.

At the scene Thursday morning, officers could be seen combing a nearby housing complex as several residents stopped by on the first work day of 2020.

That car had since been removed from the scene.

Sandra Persaud, who lives in the nearby housing complex, said she was home when she heard a series of loud explosions. “I thought I heard fireworks,” she said.

She said she is increasingly concerned about the state of gun violence in Toronto, which hit record levels last year.

“It’s scary,” she said. “I have three young boys and we could have been outside last night.”

“We have to hope that things will get better.”

Tariq Ehsan Ullah, a store clerk at a nearby River Street grocery, arrived at work to find the area outside the store cordoned off by police tape.

He said officers told him the shooting happened nearby on Oak Street.

“Luckily, nothing happened inside the store,” he said, standing behind the counter. “When I arrived at work around 7 a.m., they had the area cordoned off. I had to wait to enter the store.”

The New Year’s Day shooting comes after Toronto’s bloodiest year for gun violence in 2019.

As of 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, 292 people had been killed or injured in shootings in the city, 56 more than the previous year, which, itself, set a record for the most people shot the15 years police data covers.

DAMASCUS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 01st January, 2020) One person was killed and 53 were injured throughout Syria on New Year's Eve due to indiscriminate celebratory shooting and firecrackers, Syrian state television reported on Wednesday.

According to a Sputnik correspondent in Damascus, local residents celebrated the start of 2020 by shooting in the air with tracer bullets that left red marks in the sky.

Last year, two people died as a result of stray bullets, and at least 85 were injured.

In Damascus, shortly after midnight, a 17-year-old man was fatally hit with a stray bullet to his head, a source in the police told Syria tv. Also in the capital, 10 people were hospitalized with various injuries caused by bullets and firecrackers.

Thirty-two people, including children, were injured in Latakia. Four citizens were injured in the city of Hama, two in Aleppo, three in Tartus and two in Homs."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

Kurt Eichenwald of all people suddenly thinks Peters is a “patriot”. The left is out regaling him as a man of honor and an honest man. Imagine that!

In a letter to the company, retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, a NeverTrumper, says he is leaving his post as a Fox News analyst because the network has become a “propaganda machine” that is “wittingly harming our system of government for profit.”

If he wants to see propaganda, he should watch CNN. When he shows up at CNN or MSNBC, can we call him a profit whore?

He said they have gone from an “outlet for conservative voices to a mere propaganda machine for a destructive and ethically ruinous administration.” On his way out, he called the Fox Prime Time hosts “Russia apologists”. Peters would love to go to war with Russia.

Remember when he called former President Obama a “total pussy” who had been “date raped” by Vladimir Putin? Apparently, that’s all forgotten now.

Peters wrote: “As a Russia analyst for many years, it also has appalled me that hosts who made their reputations as super-patriots and who, justifiably, savaged President Obama for his duplicitous folly with Putin, now advance Putin’s agenda by making light of Russian penetration of our elections and the Trump campaign. Despite increasingly pathetic denials, it turns out that the “nothing-burger” has been covered with Russian dressing all along. And by the way: As an intelligence professional, I can tell you that the Steele dossier rings true — that’s how the Russians do things. The result is that we have an American president who is terrified of his counterpart in Moscow.”

Okay, that’s the left’s new hero. Thank you for your service Lt. Col., now go away. He isn’t very grateful for Fox providing him with a tidy income all these years.

He presents no evidence for his assertions in his letter, just more of his hate-Trump mantra.

New Delhi : Prime Minister Narendra Modi dialed a number of leaders heading the neighbouring nations to extend his greetings on the start of the New Year 2020. But, he skipped the call to Pakistan PM Imran Khan. In his conversation with the prominent leaders of Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Bangladesh and Nepal, PM Modi focused on the ""vision of shared peace, security, prosperity and progress for all of India's friends and partners in the region"", the government said in a statement.

Last year in February 14, a suicide bomber from a Pakistan-based terror group – Jaish-e-Mohammad had killed more than 40 Indian soldiers in Pulwama. Days after India conducted an air strike on the Balakot region to wipe out terror camps.

In the following months, Pakistan tried several alternate ways to go for a dialogue and also tried to raise the issue on the international platforms, but failed everytime. India reiterated its stance that talks and terror cannot go hand in hand.

Yesterday, General MM Naravane, the new Army chief, took a tough line on Pakistan and the terror it sponsors, saying in such situations, ""We reserve the right to pre-emptively strike at sources of terror"".

According to the information provided by the government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa that the ties with them will be enhanced. He also congratulated his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina on her re-election as the chief of the Awami League for three years.", Carry out suicide bombing,3
20530,80f244b95fb99c092cf646be245ce789,"The New York Times obituary of neocon historian Gertrude Himmelfarb shows why neoconservatives remain a potent political force in U.S. politics: many liberals can’t imagine a socialist challenge to capitalism that doesn’t apologize for authoritarianism.

The NYT’s sentimental gloss of Himmelfarb’s life avoids mention of the actual positions she and her neconservative co-thinkers adopted that justified social inequality at home and slaughter abroad, from their anti-feminism and tirades against black liberation to their endorsement of U.S. military invasions overthrowing democratically elected governments, as in Chile. In contrast, Himmelfarb’s one-time comrades, Phyllis and Julie Jacobson, who founded and edited New Politics, dedicated their political activity and intellectual work to a consistent defense of democracy, social equality, and peace—a worldview the NYT and many liberals can’t fathom.

Ironically, it was Phyllis Jacobson who “recruited her childhood friend… Gertrude Himmelfarb, to the movement,” as Barry Finger notes in his obituary of Phyllis. But unlike Himmelfarb and the Commentary set, the Jacobsons “accommodated their views to fit no political fashion; to curry favor neither with academia nor with any left mainstream. They fought against the war in Vietnam, without succumbing to illusions about Ho Chi Minh and the NLF; they struggled against American intervention in Nicaragua, without closing their eyes to the Sandinistas’ infringements on democracy; they fought against CIA-inspired overthrow attempts of Castro, while exposing the Castro regime’s repressive anti-democratic nature. They engaged the struggle for democratic unions, while condemning racism both in the ranks and in leadership policies of the labor movement. And they saw no contradiction in fighting for both at once.”

In its utterly uncritical take on Himmelfarb, her husband Irving Kristol, and Commentary magazine, the mouthpiece of neoconservatism, the NYT obituary avoids any mention of their consistent, vicious efforts to discredit challenges to the capitalist status quo. In contrast, writing in New Politics, historian Martin Duberman noted how Himmelfarb, then chair of the CUNY Graduate School History Department, insisted he had no place in the Department because “sexual history wasn’t ‘real’ history at all; it had been spawned by political polemics, not scholarly necessity.” Duberman observes about Himmelfarb’s rebuke: “As if a scholar’s political and social views don’t always, consciously or not, color his/her narratives (Himmelfarb herself—a right-wing conservative—being among the more notorious current examples).” Duberman also recalls Himmelfarb warning that his “standing as a legitimate scholar… might well be at stake.”

The NYT obit ends with an apt quote from their friend and fellow neoconservative, Daniel Bell, who called the union of Himmelfarb and Kristol “the best marriage of our generation.” The quote, like the obit, with its expression of neoconservatives’ blind love (of capitalism) belonged in the Sunday weddings."," Threaten, not specified below",3

He made separate phone calls to his counterparts in Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka, but bypassed Pakistan.

This is not the first time PM Modi gave a cold shoulder to Pakistan. Ever since India’s ties with Pakistan began worsening, especially following the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019, the theocratic neighbours have remained missing from the Prime Minister’s list.

The tension between the two countries reached its peak in recent times when Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed attacked Indian military camp in a pre-dawn attack on September 18, 2016 killing 17 Indian Army personnel.

In reply, the Indian Army carried out a pre-emptive strike on terrorist training camps in Pakistan, 11 days after the attack from Jaish-e-Mohammed, killing over 35 terrorists.

Things became worse after 40 CRPF troopers lost their lives in a suicide bomber attack by Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir.

After a brief period of thaw, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan invited the wrath of the ruling party in India once again by openly criticising the decision to strike down Article 370 from the Constitution on August 5 and splitting the state into two union territories.

According to a Mint report, while extending New Year greetings on behalf of all Indians, PM Modi laid extra stress on his commitment towards the ‘neighbours first’ policy, and the willingness to maintain peaceful, cordial ties.

The Prime Minister made sure not to leave out countries such as Sri Lanka and Nepal, where China has made deep inroads already, along with Bhutan, which they are trying to appease at the moment.

A statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office mentioned that Modi highlighted to the King of Bhutan how the two nations have consolidated their special relations over the past year.

Meanwhile, both the President of Sri Lanka and the Prime Minister “expressed confidence that India and Sri Lanka would further enhance their friendly ties in the year 2020”.

Team Udayavani, Jan 2, 2020, 11:17 AM IST

Bengaluru: Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi on Wednesday warned that the state government would not tolerate any trouble to Kannadigas in Maharashtra over the Belagavi border issue.

“I want to tell the Maharashtra Chief Minister that the Karnataka government will not tolerate any trouble to Kannadigas in Maharashtra,” he told reporters here.

His statement comes in the backdrop of Shiv Sena workers reportedly hitting the streets in Kolhapur on Sunday and burning effigies of Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and stopping the screening of Kannada films there.

The activists had also blackened billboards, having Kannada text, of some shopkeepers in Gandhinagar area.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had in December last year appointed ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as co-coordinators to oversee his government’s efforts to expedite the case relating to the boundary dispute with Karnataka.

The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, which has been fighting for the merger of 800 odd villages with Maharashtra, had recently submitted a memorandum of their demands to Uddhav Thackeray.

Maharashtra claims the border district of Belagavi was part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, but is currently a district of Karnataka, on linguistic grounds.

Savadi, who hails from Belagavi, said the Maharashtra Chief Minister would do well to recall what his cousin Raj Thackeray had said in the past on the matter.

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray had said in October 2014 in Mumbai politicians from the state have never been serious about finding a solution to the dispute and the issue has always been used for politics.

The MNS chief had recalled that when MEK members had met him a few years ago, he had said he was prepared, if required, to meet the then Karnataka chief minister to discuss the issue and demand that there should not be an injustice on Marathi speaking people living in Belgaum and nearby areas.

On December 30, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had accused Uddhav Thackeray of raking up the Belagavi issue again for political gains and declared that ‘not even an inch of land’ would be given away."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The asset freeze follows an injunction application by the government, which is seeking to recover around $1 billion of funds that it says it is owed by Isabel dos Santos and her associates.

It is one of the highest-profile moves in an anti-corruption drive launched by President Joao Lourenço, who ended dos Santos’ nearly 40-year grip on power when he became head of state in 2017.

Isabel dos Santos, who owns stakes in companies including telecoms firm Unitel and financial firms, has denied wrongdoing during her father’s time in office.

“I would like to leave a message of tranquillity and confidence to my teams,” she tweeted on Monday. “We will continue, every day, in every business, doing our best and fighting for what I believe in for Angola. The road is long, the truth will prevail. United we stand stronger.”

Ranked as Africa’s wealthiest woman by Forbes, Isabel dos Santos chaired the state oil company Sonangol - a crucial pillar of Angola’s oil-dependent economy - before being sacked by Lourenço in late 2017.

The court order, dated Dec. 23, said the asset freezes applied to Isabel dos Santos, her husband, Sindika Dokolo, and Mário Filipe Moreira Leite da Silva, chairman of Banco Fomento Angola (BFA).

It freezes their personal bank accounts in Angola, as well as their stakes in Angolan firms including Unitel, BFA and ZAP MIDIA.

Reuters was not immediately able to reach dos Santos, Dokolo or da Silva for comment on Tuesday.

The order said the central bank would be responsible for ensuring that no funds leave the personal bank accounts of the three accused.

The boards of directors of the companies subject to the asset freezes are responsible for ensuring no profits are transferred to the accused directly or through intermediaries, until a court makes a further ruling."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Jan. 2 (UPI) -- Hong Kong police said around 400 people were arrested after an approved protest march of tens of thousands of people turned violent on the first day of the year as police deployed tear gas and protesters vandalized buildings.

Senior Superintendent Ng Lok-chun said during a press conference Wednesday the arrests were for charges of possession of offensive weapons and unlawful assembly after protesters ignored police warnings to disperse.

""Unfortunately, again, rioters hijacked the procession today, which resulted in the decision for the police to end the procession earlier this afternoon,"" Ng said.

He said the police-approved procession began peacefully around 2:30 p.m. but about 90 minutes later protesters began to vandalize an HSBC branch bank at Hennessy Road, causing police to attempt arrest.

Police called for back up after the arresting officers were surrounded and protesters began to throw hard objects, he said. In a release, police said a petrol bomb was thrown.

Ng said teargas was deployed to disperse the crowd and at 5:30 p.m. the procession organizer, Civil Human Rights Front, was contacted to call the procession off due to public safety concerns.

Civil Human Rights Front, which said over a million people participated in the procession, rejected Ng's explanation and accused police of escalating the violence when officers fired tear gas at the crowd, stating tensions over the arrests at the bank had eased.

""On the first day of year 2020, the police dismissed the first licensed assembly of the year with absurd excuse,"" the pro-democracy group said in a statement. ""Hong Kong government have shown its unwillingness to listen to the voices of the mass infringing the right of assembly of Hong Kong citizens.""

As night fell, violence escalated as five HSBC locations were vandalized and set on fire. A petrol bomb was also thrown at a Starbucks, the South China Morning Post reported.

""Having given warnings in vain, police have conducted dispersal using tear gas and a Specialized Crowd Management Vehicle,"" police said in a statement. ""Police warn all rioters to stop the illegal actions, dispersal and arrest action will be taken.""

The police erected barricades and swept from area to area making arrests of those who would not disperse, Ng said.

Protests first erupted in Hong Kong in June over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed for some refugees of Chinese law to be transferred to the mainland to face Communist Party courts. However, following accusations of police brutality, the movement evolved into a wider pro-democracy push that has persisted for seven months."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Text: 1 Corinthians 10:14-33

14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

15 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.

18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?

19 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?

20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.

21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.

22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

23 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.

24 Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.

25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:

26 For the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.

27 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.

28 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:

29 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man’s conscience?

30 For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?

31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.

32 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:

33 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

Key Verse: “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils” (1 Corinthians 10:21).

MESSAGE:

Leonard Sweet, in his book ‘Soul Tsunami’ wrote: “Our postmodern American culture wants tolerance of all beliefs…” The result is the morphing of Jesus into Syncretism. Americans are deeply spiritual and secular. We cook up our own religion to our taste.

Dictionary definition of syncretism is the amalgamation or attempted amalgamation of different religions, cultures or schools of thought. Apostle

Paul, in our text, warned the Corinthian believers against the babit of mixing their pure faith in Christ with idolatrous practices among the natives which was their way of life before their conversion. He pointed out the degree of irreverence involved when a believer who partakes in the Lord’s Table with the brethren also maintains his fellowship with the pagan feasts and ceremonies of their days. There is no gain in any opportunity that accommodates every interested party.

Interfaith dialogues can easily slip into syncretism, if care is not taken. It doesn’t mean believers of different denominations should not network with each other; but such networking should have the Bible as its base. Deceivers preach about God but equate Him with other gods in an attempt to drown out the uniqueness of God in a crowd of all-commers; the aim is to confuse the simple. New age spirituality states that all faiths are equal and we have already witnessed attempts by so-called ‘Christian leaders’ to lead the body of Christ away from God through ecumenism and syncretism. These are wolves in sheep’s clothing and the true believers must not fall for this hoax.

We must not partake in the practice of syncretism. We must continue to live, walk and act in faith while watching against Satan’s attempts to spy on our liberty and corrupt the Body of Christ.

THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: Do not eat with the devil at all; not even with a long spoon!

But, in the previous episodes, Shukla also had been seen targeting Asim in the name of his family. Whatever the reason may be, Asim's anger and words are not justified.

Provincial Police Commander John Midi said the shooting occurred when police disturbed a gang trying to break into the Central Foundation.

He said the criminal was killed after he was shot in both his feet by the responding police officers who rushed the man to the hospital. The man died at the hospital.

“Other members of the gang were also shot and injured but managed to escape.

“In the incident, two police vehicles were also damaged but no officer was injured.

“That was the only major incident reported in the province,” Mr Midi said.

“Otherwise I would like to thank the majority of people of the province, and particularly Kimbe town residents for their wonderful conduct throughout the festive season up until today.

The national Republican Party needs to appeal more to groups that it has little appeal to now, and it needs to care a lot more about these groups than it does now, especially at the national level.

I will fight for the national party to do a lot more to help the lower and middle classes, the poor, the near-poor and senior citizens.

I will fight for the national Republican Party to be AGAINST making cuts to federal government social programs including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, college student loans, and unemployment insurance benefits.

I will fight for the party to stand strongly against white nationalism/supremacy and sexism.

I will fight for the national Republican Party to stand strongly in favor of the total equality of women, including being in favor of equal pay for equal work for women as well as being in favor of heavily fining and imprisoning sexual predators who commit sexual harassment and all other forms of sexual abuse and sexual asssault.

Lastly, I will fight for the passage of a federal government national health insurance program/plan that is the same one that Ontario, Canada, has, but not the far too expensive and fiscally irresponsible “Medicare for All.”

By Miguel Angel Guevara

On April 28, 2012, a group of cyclists, among them a civic organisation named Bicitekas [es], organised a bike ride which would depart from the emblematic ‘Angel of Independence’ in the heart of Mexico City, heading towards the so-called ‘Supervía Poniente‘ (Poniente Super-road) [es] in protest at the construction of the latter.

At some point along the way, local police detained a group of six cyclists, according to Mónica Tapia A. [es] (@monicatapiaa):

Translation

Are you following #fleshandconcrete? Six cyclists @[email protected] were detained and beaten for going up to the second level of the super-road #2dopiso #supervia

The ‘Supervía Poniente’ is a project led by the left-wing government of Marcelo Ebrard [es], leader of the Federal District Government. The road aim is to link the south of the city with the area of transnational corporations located to the west of the city in a district known as Santa Fé.

Santa Fé has witnessed a rapid growth in its floating population, and it is for this reason that it has become a real ordeal for those who work there to drive to work everyday due to high levels of traffic. The ‘Supervía Poniente’ aims to be a solution to this problem, but it has attracted criticism from activists who argue that the works will have a serious environmental impact.

The bike ride which took place on Saturday, April 28, was just one of the protests against the construction of the road which have been carried out.

However, according to statements from witnesses which have been posted on Twitter, the police were seen clashing with cyclists. Jorge A. G. Matalí [es] (@elMatali) reported:

According to Daniel Gershenson [es] (@alconsumidor), the police made threats:

Jordy M.Y. [es](@jordy_my) reported being taken to an office of the Public Ministry:

Translation

Following a dispute which ended in an aggression by the traffic police, we are at office 45 in Álvaro Obregón. #fleshandconcrete

This fact angered some Twitter users, who question the coherence of a government which “promotes” the use of bicycles, as Juan Pueblo [es] (@ElcondeGiovanni) points out:

Translation

Coherence and common sense, the use of bicycles in Mexico City is promoted, but it’s not permitted to pedal in fast lanes and on second levels #FleshandConcrete

For Kar (@Karkarkarrr) the police actions are negative:

Translation

Such repression from @m_ebrard‘s government is disgusting and unjust. What harm are we doing? Why detain us? #fleshandconcrete

The capital’s government has not yet made a statement on the issue, and its head of government Marcelo Ebrard [es] (@m_ebrard) seems unworried when he tweets:

Translation

These events will continue to provoke discussion, especially considering that the campaign for leadership of the capital’s government was due to be launched just a few hours after the clash.

21098,a1ca6ae6aee401dfb3fd0359c77318b4,"On 31 December, a number of Iraqi protesters attacked parts of the US Embassy in Baghdad, following US airstrikes targeting Kata’ib Hezbollah bases in Iraq and Syria that killed 25 people and injured many more. Iran was later accused of orchestrating what has been branded as an “attack” on the US compound, allegations dismissed by Tehran.

In a late Wednesday call, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his condemnation of Tuesday’s attack on the US Embassy in Iraq, as well as the latter’s “unwavering commitment” to counter Iran’s “malign” influence in the region, according to a statement by US Department of State spokesperson Morgan Ortagus.

“The Secretary and Prime Minister reaffirmed the unbreakable bonds between the United States and Israel”, the statement reads.

The call was confirmed by Pompeo on his Twitter account.

Spoke today with @IsraeliPM @netanyahu, who reaffirmed Israel’s unwavering commitment to counter #Iran and condemned the attack on our @USEmbBaghdad. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) January 1, 2020

The secretary of state also earlier asserted that he spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi about providing protection for US personnel in Baghdad from “Iran-backed attackers”.

Spoke today with Iraqi Prime Minister al-Mahdi, who agreed that #Iraq would continue to uphold its responsibility to keep U.S. personnel secure and would move the Iran-backed attackers away from @USEmbBaghdad. We’ll continue cooperation to hold #Iran and its proxies responsible. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) January 1, 2020

Pompeo’s comments come after a statement by Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz condemning the “attack” on the US Embassy and accusing the Islamic Republic of coordinating the assault, while calling upon the international community to stand against “the crimes of the murderous regime in Tehran”.

“Iran made a grave mistake by attempting to harm American diplomats in Iraq”, Katz said on his Twitter account.

'What Happened in Iraq Will Have Its Own Consequences for US Presence in the Country' - Prof

Abas Aslani, a senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies in Tehran, says that due to the fact that the US has blamed Iran for the attack on the embassy, it is very likely that the recent developments would escalate tensions between Washington and Tehran.

He, however, doesn't think that the escalation will reach to the level of a military confrontation between the two countries, ""for neither Iran wants a war"", nor it is ""in the interests of the US in the region"".

""The United States operation in Iraq to kill 25 Iraqis was illegal, as well as violated the Iraqi sovereignty. Even if one assumes that Americans wanted to take revenge, the number of casualties were disproportionate. The US behavior caused a backlash and brought the first sit-in across U.S. embassy in Baghdad as of 2003 when Americans invaded Iraq. As US president is approaching reelection in the upcoming election at home, he needs to make a hero of himself in facing challenges abroad, specifically when he juxtaposes the events that once happened at Obama era in Benghazi and now during his tenure in Baghdad. But this has a different impact in Iraqi society. [...] What happened recently in Iraq has put the US at the public focus in the country and this will have its own consequences for American presence in Iraq.... "", Aslani opines.

On 31 December, the US Embassy in Baghdad was encircled and partly vandalised by a number of Iraqi protesters, who reportedly destroyed a reception area and sprayed pro-Iran graffiti on the walls. No injuries were reported on either side.

The protest erupted in response to US strikes against the Iraqi Shia Kata’ib Hezbollah militia that Washington believes is backed by Iran.

Following the incident, US President Donald Trump warned that Tehran would pay “a very big price”.

“This is not a Warning, it is a Threat”, the US president wrote on 1 January while wishing his followers a “Happy New Year!”

....Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019

Iran strongly dismissed the allegations about Tehran orchestrating the assault on the US Embassy, with Khamenei insisting that if the Islamic Republic decides to oppose or fight against a country this will be done “unequivocally”."," Threaten, not specified below",3
21117,7ca6ff0bda05b0c05b0b8415e7204f81,"COMMENT: Judge Jackson & the Lack of Judicial Impartiality

Martin in this very illuminating post you say:

“Clearly, the most dangerous flaw appears to be intentional – Congress appoints judges not lawyers”.

You’ve missed an important point here.

At the time of the founding most judges were “appointed” by the people; through elections!

Yes, with the federal courts it doesn’t work that way. But, with the inferior courts at the state and local level it still does; though the right has been assailed and so somewhat curtailed.

Still, it is estimated some 50,000 judge-ships are subject to the ballot; a power, like so many others, fully squandered by the American people.

The implications of an electorate organized to exercise these powers would have serious implications at the federal level just the same and these facts should not be forgotten or dismissed.

H

REPLY: Yes, the state and local levels are varied. My discussion was confined to federal, which is what Ben Franklin was opposed to. There are many regions in the state and local level where the judges are elected by the people. This too I see as wrong for they are still being sponsored by the Republican or Democratic Party and are declared as members. This still intertwines politics and does not eliminate the problem of bias.

I believe that Franklin was correct. The judges should NOT stand for election for that will transform the law into just the will of the majority. There was a case Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984) which resulted in changing our constitutional rights because politically they demanded that a black guy be found guilty for killing a white 10-year-old girl. The police could not simply transport him after his lawyer got him to self-surrender. The lawyer warned the police not to question him on the way to the jail. They did any way. The officers began a conversation with respondent that ultimately resulted in his making incriminating statements and directing the officers to the child’s body.

A federal court in a habeas corpus proceeding found that the police had obtained respondent’s incriminating statements through interrogation in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387. They had to put him on trial again using evidence concerning the body’s location. Legally, that should have never been allowed. But because this was a black man who had mental problems and a 10-year-old white girl, the thought of letting him walk was just politically unacceptable. The court thus created a rule known as the Inevitable Discovery Rule meaning that it was irrelevant that he showed the police where the body was buried, because the court ruled that they would have eventually found the body.

The impact of that political decision is that police really do not need a search warrant today, they merely have to sweep an unconstitutional illegal search and seizure under the table and rule that had they obtained a search warrant, they would have inevitably found the same evidence.

This is the problem when you mix politics with law. In order to make sure that this one black guy was punished, the entire society had to be stripped of our absolute right against illegal search and seizure. If the government wants you, you have no Constitutional rights whatsoever. Law has become a justification for legal persecution.

Sir William Blackstone, upon whose seminal legal work was to form the foundation of American law, wrote: It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer. That is the way the law is supposed to work. When you mix politics with judges, there is no rule of law that remains. The statue of justice is supposed to be blind symbolizing impartiality. That is merely fiction – like once upon a time.

I disagree with “conservative” judges who only rule in favor of the government because they see the fact that someone might be guilty is grounds for punishment and if he was innocent, God will sort that out – not judges. After all, the way those in the legal community look at everyone is that we are really all guilty or something and deserve to be punished even if the immediate crime was not valid. Hence, criminal convictions in the USA was about 70% during the 70s. It is not 98-99% because everyone MUST be found guilty or else the judge is a liberal. This is why politics must be eradicated from the law.

The corruption of the Rule of Law was always an English past time, which the Americans inherited and greatly improved upon. The idea of justice is merely a fictional dream. Charles Dickens wrote in his introduction to Bleak House;

Voters have contributed to planting 10 million trees to empower communities in areas affected by climate change in Nepal and Indonesia as the UAE had promised to plant a tree for every vote as part of the campaign.

10 million trees

The tree plantations will contribute to safeguarding biodiversity, combating climate change, protecting the environment and empowering vulnerable communities affected by climate change. The initiative reflects the UAE’s values of giving and reinforces the country’s role as a beacon of hope in the world.

Numfoor Island (Indonesia)

The UAE will focus on planting millions of mangroves and tropical forests to promote food security and empower families in Numfoor Island, one of the most disadvantaged areas of Indonesia where subsistence farmers and fishers make up approximately 75 per cent of the population. West Papua, Indonesia, situated in the Coral Triangle, is an area recognized as the global centre of marine biodiversity and a global priority for conservation because of the broad range of species it supports, including at least 500 species of reef-building corals.

Amaltaari planting site (Nepal)

In Nepal, the UAE will plant millions of mangroves at the Amaltaari planting site in Nawalparasi, home to endangered species including leopards and the elusive Bengal tiger. The tree plantations are expected to empower thousands of local people, mostly farmers, and improve their lives. The project will encourage the local people to positively contribute to protecting the biodiversity of the Asian country that hosts more than 700 species of wildlife that enrich the country’s natural elements.

Three logos

People across the globe cast their votes on one of three UAE logos displayed on the UAE Nation Brand official website. The 49 Emirati artists contributed to designing “Emirates in Calligraphy”, “The Palm” and “7 Lines”.

Open invitation

His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of UAE Armed Forces, had invited people across the globe to take part in voting for the new logo to represent the UAE. The unique call to global audiences reinforces the humanitarian and global aspect that distinguishes the UAE and reflect its deeply-rooted values of openness, coexistence and tolerance.

Top 10 voting countries

Participations in the UAE topped the list with the 15 per cent of the total votes for the Nation Brand logo, followed by India, US, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Australia, Canada, Algeria and the UK.

500 million views

The voting campaign attracted an overwhelming 500 million social media views, reflecting the widespread admiration of millions of online users who actively took part in the humanitarian initiative to help combat climate change and empower communities.

Humanitarian initiative

In an initiative that turned the national project into a global humanitarian initiative, the UAE pledged to plant a tree for every vote to the logo that will represent its story to the world.

Emirates in Calligraphy

The “Emirates in Calligraphy” logo emphasizes the unique association and sentiment that the name “Emirates” brings to citizens, residents and visitors coming together from all over the world.

The logo depicts the aesthetics of Arabic calligraphy that reflects authenticity and originality associated with the UAE. The rolling curves of the font capture the flow of ocean waves merging with the sand dunes of UAE’s golden desert, portraying the country’s unique geographical identity. The smooth and harmonious movement of the letters symbolizes the constant human and social progress in the UAE as a nation that does not stop growing in the face of challenges and does not believe in the word “impossible.” The UAE is a country built on achieving the impossible.

The Palm

The palm tree has long been associated with the Emirates, forming an indispensable part of its history and distinctive identity as an unconditional giver.

By designing the palm tree with colors closer to golden, the logo manifests the undulating vistas of the desert dunes shining in the sunlight. The elegant lines suggest the radiance, momentum and dynamism of a nation on the move.

Symbolizing the willpower of the leaders and people of UAE, palm trees have withstood storms and challenges with strength and firmness. Their powerful branches are as high as the ambitions of the people of UAE, with leaves providing shade and support to millions of people living on the land.

Similar to Canada’s maple leaf and New Zealand’s silver fern, the palm represents the national identity of the UAE and sums up the country’s values of giving, pride, dynamism and ambitions.

7 LinesSeven lines rise up tall with momentum, optimism and dynamism as a tribute to the seven bold leaders who shaped the Emirates and united their people’s aspirations under one flag. Seven lines, shaping the map of the Emirates with the national colours, represent the future-focused leaders of the seven emirates united towards the country’s growth.

The lines, vibrant in colour, reflect the UAE’s ongoing journey of development driven by a wave of progress, innovation, excellence and boundless aspirations. Designed in the flag colours of black, green and red, the lines are connected with the white colour, symbolizing the heart and spirit uniting people of the seven emirates under the main principles of humanity. The unique diversity that enriches the fabric of the UAE society and sets it apart as a global hub for entrepreneurship and innovation is featured in the different colours and sizes of the lines.

UAE Nation Brand

The UAE Nation Brand aims to create a symbol that distinguishes the UAE globally and presents its achievements and humanitarian values with the world. The new logo will share the UAE’s exceptional and inspiring success story of development with the world and reinforce the country’s global contribution to build a better future for humanity.

Notice to US Shareholders

The issue of the shares in New Topco relates to shares of a Jersey company and is proposed to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under the laws of England and Wales. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to proxy solicitation or tender offer rules under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, the scheme of arrangement is subject to the disclosure requirements, rules and practices applicable in the United Kingdom to schemes of arrangement, which differ from the requirements of US proxy solicitation or tender offer rules.

Neither the shares in New Topco, nor the Consideration Shares proposed to be issued by Bovis Homes, have been, and nor will they be, registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") or under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States. Accordingly, neither the shares in New Topco nor the Consideration Shares may be offered, sold, resold, delivered, distributed or otherwise transferred, directly or indirectly, in or into the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. The shares in New Topco and the Consideration Shares are expected to be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof. Galliford Try Shareholders who will be affiliates of New Topco after the Scheme becomes Effective or affiliates of Bovis Homes after completion of the Transaction will be subject to certain US transfer restrictions relating to the shares in New Topco and the Consideration Shares received in connection with the Transaction.

The New Galliford Try Shares have not been and are not required to be registered under the Securities Act. The New Galliford Try Shares should not be treated as ""restricted securities"" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act and persons who receive New Galliford Try Shares (other than affiliates) may resell them without restriction under the Securities Act.

For the purposes of qualifying for the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 3(a)(10), Galliford Try has advised the Court through counsel that its sanctioning of the Scheme will be relied upon by New Topco and Bovis Homes as an approval of the Scheme following a hearing on its fairness to Galliford Try Shareholders.

It may be difficult for US Shareholders to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the US federal securities laws, since New Galliford Try, Bovis Homes and Galliford Try are located in countries other than the United States, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. US Shareholders may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's judgment.

NEW DELHI: A 27-year-old firefighter died after part of a burning building collapsed here in outer Delhi’s Udyog Nagar area on Thursday, a senior official said.

The official added that a total of four men including one civilian were taken out of the debris. The deceased has been identified as Amit Baliyan, a resident of Shahdara.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal condoled his death and tweeted, ""It is with deep sadness I inform you that one of our firemen was martyred while saving people from fire. Our firemen save other people's lives by putting their lives under extremely risk in difficult circumstances. May his soul rest in peace.""



Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal also condoled the death of the firefighter.

बेहद दुःख के साथ बताना पड़ रहा है कि लोगों को आग से बचाते बचाते हमारा एक जाँबाज़ शहीद हो गया। हमारे firemen बेहद जोखिम भरी परिस्थितियों में अपनी जान की बाज़ी लगाकर लोगों को बचाते हैं। भगवान उनकी आत्मा को शांति दे https://t.co/Z6K2dYVazW — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) January 2, 2020

""Deeply anguished over the news of death of fire operator Amit Balyan Amit along with his team members fought bravely to save the lives of many people. I salute his bravery My sincere condolences to his family members. All possible assistance to be extended to the injured & bereaved family,"" he tweeted.

Fifteen firefighters received minor injuries and were admitted to Sri Balaji Action Hospital in Paschim Vihar along with four others who were rescued from the debris. According to fire officials, in the last five years, six firefighters including Baliyan have lost their lives in harness.

The building is an outlet cum- godown of Okaya batteries and inverters in Udyog Nagar, Peera Garhi. Police said that the fire started in the basement of the building that was used for storing batteries.

After the fire, strong blasts occurred in the building resulting in the structure collapsing. According to fire personnel, a part of the building had already collapsed before they could reach the spot and another part started to crumble while they were dousing the blaze.

They said that the structure felt unstable even while cooling operations were taking place in the afternoon. Delhi Fire Services (DFS) Chief Atul Garg said that a call was received at 4.23 am reporting that the four-storey building had caught fire. He added that initially seven fire tenders were rushed to the spot.

A total of 35 fire tenders were working to control the situation. Rescue operations were aided by teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and Centralised Accident and Trauma Services (CATS). BJP’s Delhi president Manoj Tiwari who reached the spot said that he was saddened about the deceased firefighter and appealed to the Delhi Government to take immediate measures to conduct a safety audit to avoid such incidents in the future.

No fire clearance, case filed. The DFS Chief Garg said that the factory did not have a No Objection Certificate from the fire office. Police have registered a case under multiple sections of IPC including Sections 285, 337 and 304-A against the owner of the building."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
21314,81d9283193e9e09b06df30efc2ca0851,"KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 2): Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak wants a stay of proceedings in the misfeasance in public office suit filed by Damansara MP Tony Pua Kiam Wee in January 2017, in relation to the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) fiasco.

Today, Najib's lawyer Datuk Mohd Hafarizam Harun told High Court Judge Datuk Rozana Ali Yusoff that Najib filed the stay of proceedings letter dated Dec 24.

In the letter, Najib wants the civil suit to be delayed pending the disposal of his criminal trials especially those involving 1MDB, according to Mohd Hafarizam.

Justice Rozana subsequently asked Pua and the government to come back to the court on Monday (Jan 6) to inform the court about their reaction to the letter. The government was also named as a defendant in the misfeasance in public office suit.

Pua was represented by lawyer Tan Cheng Leong.

Mohd Hafarizam told theedgemarkets.com that Najib wants completion of the 1MDB trials, which are still ongoing and are expected to resume later this month.

Both Mohd Hafarizam and Tan confirmed today that Najib has yet to file his defence for the misfeasance in public office suit as required by the court by Dec 30.

Mohd Hafarizam said that was one of the reasons for the stay application.

The suit was reinstated by the Federal Court on Nov 19, 2019, after the court ruled that the prime minister and ministers can be sued for misfeasance.

In January 2017, Pua filed the suit, naming Najib and the government as defendants for wrongful use of public authority. He alleged that Najib had abused public office and benefitted by receiving money from 1MDB.

Najib is facing four counts of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering involving 1MDB funds in excess of RM2.28 billion.

Najib's other 1MDB-related trials include one involving 1MDB former subsidiary SRC International Sdn Bhd. In the SRC case, Najib is facing three counts of criminal breach of trust, one for abuse of power and three for money laundering involving RM42 million of SRC funds.

Najib is also facing a separate 1MDB audit tampering trial with former 1MDB president and CEO Arul Kanda Kandasamy.

Pakistan did not figure in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s New Year call list as he dialled the leaders of the neighbouring countries and highlighted India’s commitment to the “Neighbourhood First” policy. In his conversation with the leaders of Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Bangladesh and Nepal, PM Modi focused on the “vision of shared peace, security, prosperity and progress for all of India’s friends and partners in the region”, the government said in a statement.

Less than a year ago, on February 14, a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 paramilitary soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama. Days later, the Air Force carried out the strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot, to which Pakistan retaliated, but failed to harm any Indian installations. In the months that followed, Pakistan alternated between calls for resumption of dialogue and raising Kashmir in every international forum, including the United Nations General Assembly.

An Iranian-backed militia has vowed to exact revenge for the ""aggression of evil American ravens"".

The announcement in Baghdad came a day after US defence secretary Mark Esper said Washington had carried out military strikes targeting the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia blamed for a rocket attack that killed an American contractor in Iraq last week.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the strikes send the message that the US will not tolerate actions by Iran that jeopardise American lives.

The US military said ""precision defensive strikes"" were conducted against five sites of Kataeb Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades in Iraq and Syria.

""Our battle with America and its mercenaries is now open to all possibilities,"" Kataeb Hezbollah said in a statement.

""We have no alternative today other than confrontation, and there is nothing that will prevent us from responding to this crime.""

The US blames the militia for a rocket barrage that killed a US defence contractor at a military compound near Kirkuk, in northern Iraq.

Officials said as many as 30 rockets were fired in that attack.

Iraq's Hezbollah Brigades, a separate force from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, operates under the umbrella of the state-sanctioned militias known collectively as the Popular Mobilisation Forces. Many of them are supported by Iran.

The Popular Mobilisation Forces said the US strikes killed at least 19 of Kataeb Hezbollah's members. But Kataeb Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Mohieh told reporters that the death toll rose to 25.

At least 51 militiamen were wounded and some of them were in serious condition, he said, adding that the militia group's commanders would decide on the retaliation.

In Tehran, foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi condemned the US strikes against Kataeb Hezbollah as an ""obvious case of terrorism"" and accused Washington of ignoring Iraq's sovereignty.

Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah also blasted the ""brutal American aggression"", saying those who took the decision to carry out the attack ""will soon discover how stupid this criminal decision was"".

Kataeb Hezbollah is led by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, one of Iraq's most powerful men.

He once battled US troops and is now the deputy head of the Popular Mobilisation Forces. In 2009, the State Department linked him to the elite Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, designated a foreign terrorist organisation by US President Donald Trump last year.

The US maintains some 5,000 troops in Iraq, at the invitation of the Iraqi government, to assist and train in the fight against Isil.

21428,cfd9b423c8fe60a7def9fc7547663174,"I have just returned from the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, which was the home of the ancient Mayan civilisation, rich in history and culture.





I was reminded about a story that Alyse Nelson, Co-founder of Vital Voices told us earlier this year about the Mayans which is truly remarkable and worth reflecting about.









According to the Mayans, 21 December 2012 signified the end of the “Great Cycle” of its Long Count calendar that equalled about 5125 years. At the end of each of these Universal Cycles, the Mayans believe that the Universe is destroyed and then recreated. The current cycle is the era of “feminine energy” where we will see a rise of women leadership across the world. But in the meantime, there will be tensions and upheaval and women will face pushback and backlash from men as we rise.





In short, they believe a “masculine” age is over, and we are at the start of a “feminine era”. That sounds right to me.





If I reflect on my own journey, I cannot dispute that the last seven years have been some of the most significant in my life. On December 16, 2012, there was the horrific gang rape of Jyoti Singh on a bus in Delhi which was a seminal incident in highlighting the issue of violence against women and girls in India.





In response to that brutal incident, I chose to make a career switch from the aviation industry to the development sector to work on prevention of sexual violence and advancement of women’s rights through co-founding Safecity.





Seven years on, groups like mine who have been agitating for change have seen some progress. For instance, there are stronger laws for crimes against women, better protection of children from child sexual abuse, more protection, prevention and redressal of sexual harassment of women at the workplace and more.





Conversations about sexual violence and its causes are being spoken about more often and more openly. The global #MeToo movement that caught fire in 2017 was also instrumental in putting the issue front and centre in our daily lives. Gender seems to be a regular topic at every conference and event and #Manels are being regularly called out.





Yet, the progress does not seem enough or fast enough, and I think we are seeing the kinds of backlash predicted.





This year alone there were several terrible events that highlight how sexual violence is deeply rooted in our society and is linked to the low status of women and girls.





Uttarakhand in India, announced a red alert because for the three months prior to the report, there was no girl child born amongst the 216 births in 132 villages in the Uttarkashi district. Hundreds of women have had hysterectomies in Beed district, Maharashtra because the cane-cutting contractors are not willing to hire women who menstruate. There was the brutal Unnao case and the Hyderabad case and so many more. It has become really depressing to read the newspapers as everyday there is an incident being reported.





As we end the year and begin a new one, one wonders how can we change the situation and what comes next? How can we see more progress than backlash?





Need radical changes in education system

The answer lies in a fundamental mindset shift as lack of equality is at the root of this violence. We need radical changes in our educational system and in the way we approach policy making. Introducing sex education from an early age in school curriculum is essential for teaching respect, consent and understanding unconscious bias. A welcome step is the plan by the Delhi government to engage boys in respectful behaviour. This, coupled with their Happiness curriculum, could be a game changer in addressing toxic masculinity. Another step that the Delhi government has introduced is free transport for women on the metro which will increase the presence of women in public spaces at all times of day and night improving the perception of safety. Hopefully all State Governments will follow suit and introduce such curriculum in schools and colleges and create ways for women to more safely and affordably be in public spaces.





Making the workplace safe and inclusive

In the New Year, I would encourage all institutions to fully and intentionally implement the POSH Act and ensure that the workplace is a safe and inclusive one for all. This will go a long way in ensuring women have the ability to earn a decent living thus giving them the financial independence to make choices in life. Confidence in safe work spaces could also increase the participation of women in the formal labour force, which is currently at a pathetic 24 percent. Alongside this, the institutions should also address the pay gap and the number of women in leadership positions.





If we cannot see, we cannot be. Therefore, we need to amplify the voices of women in every sector and field so as to provide more role models to the youth. We have those examples - the women scientists at ISRO, NASSCOM India is headed by a woman and recently Forbes listed four Indian American women heading top 50 tech companies.





From around the world, we also have examples that can inspire and motivate us. The current US elections include the most number of women Presidential candidates in the country’s history, Finland just elected a coalition government of five parties headed by women, and Esther Duflo became the 52nd woman to win a Nobel prize.





We need to celebrate these wins. For with every one of them we move forward in our fight for equality and a world free from violence. We have no choice but to watch out for each other, encourage more women to take risks and celebrate our successes.





Let’s make this decade the one where we accelerate our progress towards a safe, inclusive and equal Feminine Era.

21449,72115e6c05808508d4299ebe73315b10,"SINGAPORE: Gaming company Razer Inc has teamed up with homegrown Singaporean entrepreneurs and Asian billionaires to apply for a full digital banking licence, joining the race to create virtual lenders in the city state.

Razer Fintech, the company’s financial technology unit, will own a 60% stake in the group, while five partners will hold the remaining 40%, according to a statement.

They are Sheng Siong Holdings Pte, the private company of the Singaporean Lim brothers behind a popular local supermarket chain; billionaire Richard Li’s insurance company FWD Group; internet entrepreneur Chen Danian’s tech company LinkSure Global Holdings Ltd; Insignia Ventures Partners; and Carro, an online car marketplace.

Razer’s consortium is the second group to submit an application for the digital full banking licence after Grab Holdings Inc and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd announced their joint bid on Dec 30.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore is set to announce the winners of five digital banking licenses in mid-2020.

Efforts to open up the Singapore banking industry to technology companies come on the heels of a similar move in Hong Kong, where units of Ant Financial and other Chinese firms including Tencent Holdings Ltd obtained licences.

Southeast Asia’s digital lending market is expected to more than quadruple to US$110 billion by 2025, according to a report by Bain & Co, Google and Temasek Holdings Pte.

Instead of fighting local banks, Razer Fintech plans to target the youth and millennial segment in Singapore. But eventually, it aims to roll out globally as Razer Youth Bank, making it the first bank of its kind.

“Youth and millennials are underserved even in a crowded space like Singapore,” said Lee Li Meng, Razer’s chief strategy officer who assumed an additional role as chief executive officer of Razer Fintech from Jan 1.

Targeting those in the age group of 12 to 35 years, he said many young people grow up with little financial knowledge. When they join the workforce they struggle to open a bank account or get a credit card or loans due to lack of savings and credit history.

“We want to help them from a young age,” Lee said.

Razer is trying to leverage on its large, young fan base and its existing digital payments networks Razer Merchant Services and e-wallet service Razer Pay.

It’s also looking to its global presence – the company is based in Singapore and San Francisco but has retail stores in places like London, Las Vegas, Hong Kong and Taipei – to boost its digital bank’s international prospects.

It’s also trying to capitalise on younger consumers who use their mobile phones to read, chat and play, and stream music and videos. Such users will expect to use mobile phones to manage their money and trade stocks for more convenient and speedier services, Lee said.

Razer co-founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan has been trying to build an ecosystem of software and services for gamers to reduce Razer’s reliance on hardware peripherals such as gaming mice and keyboards. It got into the digital wallet business by acquiring e-payments platform MOL Global.

Since forming Razer Fintech as a separate entity in April 2018, it has built a large digital payment network in southeast Asia and processed more than billions of dollars in total payment value.

Razer Fintech has about 200 employees and some of its most prominent hires include Lim Siong Guan, former president of GIC Pte, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.

“We’ve thought about this long and hard,” Lee said

“We believe that we can do something revolutionary here in Singapore.”

However, many Nigerians believe that despite the challenges, including large-scale insecurity and sluggish economic growth, this year offers an opportunity for the nation's leaders to raise hope by recommitting to tackling the ranging challenges inhibiting the country from achieving its great potential.

According to analysts THISDAY spoke to at the tail end of last year, what this year holds in stock for Nigerians would depend on what its political and business leaders do or fail to do.

Consequently, THISDAY Board of Editors has isolated 20 Nigerians, who by their prevailing positive contributions to the polity's development so far, it believes, would help shape events in the country in 2020, the year the paper would celebrate its 25 years of sterling contributions not only to the evolution of modern journalism but also to the development of the country.

Muhammadu Buhari:

Wind that Changes the Sail's Course

The combination of his influence and cult-like persona, especially among his followers, places President Muhammadu Buhari in a locus to shape the events of the next decade, which began yesterday.

The president, who rode to power in 2015 on the crest of his perceived integrity and the absolute trust he commands among his large supporters, has been able to push through some major controversial policies such as the increment in the pump price of petrol from N87 per litre to N145 and land border closure without much protests from the people.

As Nigeria moves into a new decade along with the rest of the world, the president, who has just begun the final lap in his presidential tour of duty, through his vision, body language and quest to book an assured place for himself in history will determine the course of the nation in key areas such as the economy, the anti-graft war and the war against insurgency in the North-east.

His gravitas, which invigorated the anti-graft war and the war against insurgency in his first term in office, will determine to what extent his administration, and by extension, the nation could consolidate on the gains of his first term in office.

Much of the nation's fortunes or failures in the next decade and thenceforth would be shaped by the zeal, seriousness and candour with which the president directs his lieutenants to pursue his vision in the next three years that presage the end of his final tenure in power.

Yemi Osinbajo:

The Man with First Right of Refusal

Since he assumed office as vice president, Osinbajo has discharged the functions of his office dutifully. Besides being assigned functions by the president, he oversees the economic planning team and report, as well as makes recommendations, to the president who takes the final decision.

When on May 9, 2017, Buhari embarked on a medical trip, Osinbajo became acting president for the period the president was away, taking import decisions that helped to shape the country and douse tension. Ironically, some of those decisions, including the sacking of Director, State Security Service, Mr. Lawal Daura, after a DSS siege on the National Assembly in 2017, did not go down well power centers in the presidential villa.

Consequently, subsequent presidential trips abroad have not witnessed the handover of power to him, fueling speculations that hitherto smooth relations between the president and his deputy had gone sour. Recent sacking of Osinbajo's aides and reduction of his responsibilities by the presidency deepened this speculation.

How Osinbajo reacts to his seeming marginalisation would determine the stability of the presidency which is essential for good governance, particularly as the nation struggle to battle its declining economy.

Atiku Abubakar:

Against all Odds, Still a Reckoning Force

At 74 by the decade and 77 years by the next election cycle, there is such an irresistible tendency on the part of many analysts to write off former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and the torch bearer of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last general election.

But that is a perilous task given the fact that Atiku, who has been on the political scene since the rebirth of democracy in 1999, remains for now a factor in the Nigerian politics. Like Buhari, Atiku has become a veteran presidential runner, a race he has been involved in since 2007.

Besides, he is a well-heeled politician with a wide international and national network as well as a deep war chest that he could deploy either to achieve his perennial presidential quest or to oil the political machinery of any candidate he supports.

Except the subterranean campaign by some influential PDP members for a much younger presidential candidate in the 2023 general election coalesce into a strong force whose tide would be unstoppable, Atiku, in the interim, looks good to clinch the party's ticket again.

But irrespective of whether he runs in 2023 or not, Atiku remains a viable force in the polity as whichever party he identifies with will need his assets, which will give him a leverage in shaping events in the party and national politics.

Adams Oshiomhole:

His Defining Decade

Oshiomhole's place in national affairs in the next one year lies in his unique position as the national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Since he took over from his fellow Edo man, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, on June23, 2018, Oshiomhole has strove to rebrand the party.

His stewardship and management skills have given the party both gains and losses. The party lost some key states such as Zamfara and Bauchi to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last general election. It was also disqualified from the race in Rivers State due to an internal strife among its bigwigs in the state.

But it made an inroad into Bayelsa State where it dislodged the PDP, which was the ruling party in the state since 1999 in last month's governorship election in the state; and retained Kogi State, against initial odds.

Despite his achievements in the party, this year is going to task Oshiomhole's leadership skills to the limit as the party begins to consider a post-Buhari existence. As the president in the next two years will begin the winding down of his active political career as his final term in office expires, the worries of most political analysts is who will be the centripetal figure to weld the various tendencies in the party together like the president has so far done.

Oshiomhole, who is presently battling an ouster war, championed by some governors of the party, will play a key role in defining the future of the APC, and to a large of extent, that of Nigeria, should he survive the groundswell of opposition launched against him.

Bola Tinubu:

Astute Political Strategist

First elected senator for the Lagos West Constituency in 1993 during military regime, Tinubu has today become a household name in the Nigerian politics.

After the return to democracy, he was elected governor of Lagos State, holding office from May 29, 1999 to May 29, 2007. In Lagos today, Tinubu's name rings bell: a resolute godfather. Virtually everybody in position of authority in the state achieved the height with his assistance: from local government to the governorship seat and to the House of Assembly. He singlehandedly nominated, Babatunde Fashola, Akinwunmi Ambode and Babajide Sanwo-Olu.

At the national level, his influence is immeasurable. He was largely responsible for the change agenda that brought in the Buhari's administration in 2015 and 2019.

News in some quarters is that Tinubu is nursing a presidential ambition for 2023. Already, there are clandestine realignment of structures and mobilisation towards his presidential ambition. In 2020, his ambition will come to fore. Already, while to some, Tinubu was the architect of building a modern Lagos, a template, which successive governors relied on for successful tenures in office, others feel that he is one of the problems of Nigeria for making them to vote for Buhari in 2015 and 2019, leading Nigeria into the current not cheering situation.

Ahmad Lawan:

Unrepentant Political Collaborator

Presently one of the longest-serving lawmakers at the national level, Lawan recently made history when he became President of the Senate. First elected to the House of Representatives for Yobe State in 1999, he was elected to the Senate in 2007. In 2008, he was a member of the National Assembly's Joint Committee on Constitution Review. In 2009, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Accounts, Lawan initiated and sponsored the Desertification Control Commission Bill.

Lawan ran for re-election in Yobe North Senatorial District on the ANPP platform in 2011, APC in 2015 and 2019 and won.

With the support of Buhari, he became president of the 9th Senate, after defeating his opponent, Senator Ali Ndume, who is also an APC senator.

Since his emergence, the senate president has not hidden the fact that he would work very closely with the executive arm of government to avoid the frequent conflicts that transpired during the 8th Assembly.

For this reason, many Nigerians are not happy with him, especially the speed with which he approves executive requests from the presidency. They want to see a legislature that would stand up to the excesses of the executive in order uphold the doctrine of the separation of powers.

For these reasons, the way and manner Lawan runs the affairs of the Senate will affect the direction of the Buhari administration in 2020.

Abba Kyari:

The Presidential Power House

Even though he was an influential figure before he was appointed as Chief of Staff by the president in 2015, Kyari, no doubt, has become more powerful. There is nothing happening in the country today that he is said not to be aware of. Seen as a renowned technocrat, the recent directive by the president to ministers to see Kyari, if they want to schedule a meeting with him, shows the kind of influence he wields at the seat of power.

Apart from protecting the interests of the president, Kyari as Chief of Staff controls the flow of people into the seat of power. He continues to live up to the responsibilities of his office and for this he has become fair game for his detractors who seek him as the arrow of the cabal.

Even in those dark days when the president was down in health, Kyari was an oasis of support and inspiration; he had to contend and contain with the maneuvers of over ambitious powerful vested interests, which plotted to take over the reins of government.

In 2020, his influence will continue to soar especially with many feeling that he is behind the plot to draft Babagana Kingibe into the presidential race in 2023.

Kayode Fayemi:

A Rallying Force for 'Next Generation' Politicians

Fayemi, governor of Ekiti State, former Minister of Solid Minerals and Chairman, Nigerian Governors' Forum (NGF), among others, has worked his way up the political ladder from being an activist and academic. And in so short a period of doing so, he has become a rallying force of sort for those who believe it is time to end gerontocracy in Nigeria.

He commands respect among his colleagues in the NGF and is one of the few South-west politicians who enjoy the confidence of Buhari, a trust that saw to him playing key roles in the presidential campaigns during the 2015 and 2019 general elections.

His position in NGF, an influential group comprising the 36 state governors, puts him in a position to influence policies, especially at the federal level, and a network that becomes an asset for executing political agenda.

With his tenure in Ekiti ending a year ahead of that of the president, there is no doubt that Fayemi will play active role in APC or if the talks of political realignment ahead of the 2023 general election become a reality, whichever party emerges from the transmutation.

Although there are rumours of him nursing a presidential ambition after his tenure, he has at many fora disclaimed such a quest. But in Nigeria, attention is better paid not to the words of a politician, but his body language. Is there, therefore, a dissonance between Fayemi's words and body language? Although the years ahead hold the answer, Fayemi by virtue of his position for now, is a key player in shaping the future of the nation in 2020.

Ibrahim Magu:

Nightmare of the Corrupt

Despite the clouds over his continued stay in the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Ibrahim Magu, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, has remained an influential figure in national affairs since he assumed office in interim capacity on November 9, 2015.

His continued stay in office despite his inability to get Senate confirmation twice due to political shenanigans is a testimony to how much he enjoys the confidence of the president due to his stewardship.

With war against corruption being one of the cardinal policies of the Buhari administration and EFCC being a flagship of the nation's anti-corruption agencies, Magu is emplaced to shape events of 2020 by how he is able to prosecute the anti-graft war and stave political interference off in the commission's activities.

Should he survive the current underground campaign to have him ship off to either the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) in Kuru, to attend the mandatory course for officers of certain ranks, or return to any police formation in the country, Magu will play key role in 2020 in determining the intensity of the anti-graft war and consequentially, the fate of many politically-exposed persons still nursing political ambition.

Mele Kyari:

Taking Oil and Gas to the Next Level

Crude oil plays a dominant role in shaping the direction of the Nigerian economy and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) regulates Nigeria's oil and gas sector. As the man at the helms of affairs at the NNPC, Mele Kyari is one of the men that would shape activities in Nigeria this New Year. The NNPC boss, who was appointed in June last year, is expected to, through his TAPE Agenda (Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence), drive innovations that would raise oil revenue in the country.

In line with the corporation's TAPE Agenda, the NNPC would create innovation labs that will crowd source and harness ideas in solving different business challenges across the value-chain.

Godwin Emefiele:

Using Monetary Policies to Aid Economic Recovery

Considering the acute fiscal challenges Nigeria is presently facing, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will through its development finance mandate continue to play its interventionist role in the economy. Therefore, policies of the CBN under the leadership Emefiele are expected to shape activities in the Nigerian economy this year.

Emefiele has never hidden his desire to continue to oversee a people-focused central bank. Clearly, this prompted the recent decision by the central bank to slash bank charges as well as its aggressive implementation of the CBN's pro-poor Anchor Borrowers' Programme and other development finance initiatives.

Aliko Dangote:

An Industrialist as a Rescuer

Dangote, the President of the Dangote Group is unarguably one of those that would shape events in Nigeria in 2020. Apart from the presence of his companies in many sectors of the economy, the ongoing road construction from the Apapa port to Toll

Gate on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway will be a game-changer for the country in 2020. The construction work, which started some months ago, was under the Presidential Order Number 7. The order allows companies to build roads and have the money spent deducted from their three-year taxes.

Dangote stated: ""We started the road right from the port at Apapa. We are building 10 lanes - five lanes on each side - and there is drainage on both sides and streetlight. It is a concrete road. It is the first heavy concrete road that is up to about 35 kilometres. We would also maintain it for five years. This road will last up to 100 years.

""Government gave us 36 months to complete this project, but I can assure you that we would finish it in 15 months. We should be able to finish before the end of next year.""

Herbert Wigwe:

A Business Combine Harvester

Since its business combination deal with the defunct Diamond Bank, Access Bank has emerged as a leading financial power house in the country. The bank, which is now looking beyond Nigeria and seeks to expand its footprint in Africa with its latest acquisition of the Transnational Bank Limited of Kenya, has Mr. Herbert Wigwe as its Chief Executive Officer.

Presently Access Bank boasts of being among the five largest banks in Nigeria in terms of assets size, deposits, loans and branch network. The bank's vision is to be the world's most respected African bank.

Access Bank under the leadership of Wigwe is expected to play a dominant role in the economy in 2020.

Jim Ovia:

The Banking Guru, Philanthropist

The Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr. Jim Ovia, is one of the leading employers in Nigeria and the founder of one of Nigeria's tier one banks in the country, Zenith Bank Plc.

Ovia is a philanthropist and the founder and proprietor of James Hope College, Agbor in Delta State. His foundation, which focuses on providing scholarship to the less-privileged, has a number of beneficiaries that are now qualified medical doctors, engineers, etc.

He is also the founder of several enterprises and philanthropic institutions, including the Youth Empowerment & ICT Foundation, which focuses on improving the socio-economic welfare of Nigerian youths.

Nyesom Wike:

Stormy Petrel of South-south Politics

Surviving two serious attempts to remove him from office, Wike, the governor of Rivers State has definitely become a formidable voice not just in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but the country in general.

After his election in 2015, attempts were made to truncate his victory through the tribunal. While the Election Petitions Tribunal and Appeal Tribunal nullified his election, He was eventually saved by the Supreme Court.

For his re-election, the number security operatives deployed in the state even when the All Progressives Congress (APC) was not on the ballot, made many to think that Wike had lost the poll. But with majority of his people behind him and his indefatigability he still won.

Since his victory, the governor has become a strong voice not just in the PDP but the entire South-south. This will help to shape the party in 2020 and beyond.

Zainab Ahmed:

Economy Minder

Nigeria's Finance Minister, Ms. Zainab Ahmed, will play a pivotal role in the economy in 2020. For instance, with this year's budget already signed into law and with implementation commencing yesterday, the minister will be responsible for allocation of the country's limited funds, maintaining fiscal discipline, ensuring compliance with the budget law, enforcing effective control of budgetary expenditures. In addition, as the country prepares to approach the debt market, she will be at the centre in advising the government on the best way to go about the initiative.

Also, with the Finance Bill expected to be signed into law in the coming days, Ahmed who has always stressed that Nigeria's problem remains its weak revenue generating profile, is expected to be seen exerting more energy in driving fiscal policies that would help significantly raise the country's income level in 2020.

In addition, this year, there is the expectation of a sustained coordination between her ministry and the monetary policy arm of the government this year, to help address some of the challenges the economy is facing.

Femi Falana:

Unrelenting Agitator for Rule of Law

Human rights lawyer and activist, Femi Falana (SAN) is one irritant the Buhari administration would give anything to persuade, but he has stubbornly refused to be on the same page with the government, often on account of violation of the rights of a citizen by the government.

Incidentally, Falana appears to be the nemesis of this government. Wherever there is a high profile suspect of financial crime or treason, the senior lawyer is sure to tackle the government and demand their release or proper prosecution.

Falana serves as lawyer to the leader of the Shiite Muslims in Nigeria, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, who is being detained for alleged complications in an attack on the convoy of the Chief of Army Staff among other allegations bordering on breach of security and public peace. He also led the legal team that battled for the release of the convener of the #RevolutionNow protest and Publisher of the online news website, Sahara Reporters, Mr. Omoyele Sowore.

As long as there are incidents of abuse of human rights, there is no doubt that Falana will continue to lend his influential voice to advocacy for a society where the rule of law is respected.

Olusegun Obasanjo:

Activist Outside Power

Since he left office as president in 2007, former President Olusegun Obasanjo has stayed true to his self-imposed mandate as the conscience of the nation.

He remains till date one of the few former African leaders with a wide reach and influence in international arena and respected by many world leaders.

He has used such influence to help government and some key individuals through the backend channels to resolve some knotty issues.

He has, on many occasions, had cause to take on his predecessors, over how they have been managing the nation's affairs.

His penchant for public letter writing to warn his predecessors about the effects of their leadership styles on governance, and consequently on the people, has pitted him against successive governments and sometimes earned him an admixture of applause and opprobrium.

However, irrespective of whatever offences one might level against Obasanjo, his patriotic fervour is certainly not even in doubt; despite allegations that his patriotic agenda might sometimes be self-serving.

With a new year that will herald another political transition of sort with the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration superintending over the conduct of elections that would birth a change in national political leadership, Obasanjo, given his antecedent, is expected to be more vocal on national issues and his suggestions or criticisms could influence how government formulates or executes public policies.

John Nwodo:

Champion of Igbo Presidency

As President General of the apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief John Nnia Nwodo epitomizes the aspiration of every Igbo speaking community, and protects the rights and interests of the Igbo people around the world. Igbos are one of the three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria.

In 2020, the discourse on Igbo presidency will assume broader dimension. While Nwodo's group is not partisan, it does not shy away from making political comments and taking sides, where it believes the best interest of Ndi Igbo will be served. So far, the only public office in the federal government that has eluded the Igbos is the office of executive president of Nigeria.

How Nwodo deals with the popular combative Pan-Igbo pro-secession group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which favours confrontation as opposed to Ohaneze's consultative stance will say a lot about the Igbo quest for the presidency in the New Year.

In the same period, customers' deposit rose by 5.1% to N2.390trillion. This impressive results commands attention on Mr. Segun Agbaje, Managing Director of Guaranty Trust Bank and Director MasterCard Advisory Board Middle East and Africa.

In 2016, the GTBank Fashion Weekend was instituted as a consumer-focused fair and free business platform designed to showcase the best of Africa's fashion to a global audience.

21694,e87913c79ae7fb2f9f39a5f1a499a4ac,"MOGADISHU, Somalia - Al-Qaida associates in Somalia Al-Shabaab on Tuesday suffered a major setback in its attempts to disorganize the federal government, Garowe Online reports.

Special Forces commonly called Danaab on Wednesday confirmed the latest onslaught against the militants in Lower Shebelle, a region that has often witnessed fierce battles.

Tuesday's battle, Danab said, left at least 20 militants dead. It was the first major attack on Al-Shabaab launched by the Somalia army.

Ismail Abdi Malik, commander of the 16th Unit of Somali Special Forces, told journalists that ""our forces have taken control of many villages during the operation, such as Mordinle, Bula Maskin, Faqayle, Bula Bashir and we inflicted heavy casualties on the militants, killing 20 of them during the offensive.""

He added that the army will maintain operations until it drives the militants out of the whole region. Residents said there was an intense confrontation between the army and the militants.

Danab elite forces are trained by the United States and are often deployed during sophisticated missions targeting militants across the country.

In October, the Special Forces thwarted an Al-Shabaab attack at the US army base in Ballidogle, killing at least 11 militants who had raided the camp.

Although greatly neutralized, Al-Shabaab militants often carry out perilous attacks targeting the army. On Saturday, the group unleashed in Mogadishu killing over 85 people.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo took a swipe at the group, insisting that ""Al-Shabab don't build, they destroy"".

""They don't build schools, they don't build health centers, they don't feed children. They are contracted on preventing progress and killing the people and children of Somalia,"" he added.

Before Tuesday's attack, US forces with the aid of Danab also carried three airstrikes in Lower Shebelle which reportedly killed at least four militants.

Al-Shabaab has waged guerilla-like war against the UN-backed Somalia government for over a decade now, despite suffering setbacks in the process.

The UN has deployed slightly over 20,000 soldiers mainly from East Africa to Somalia. The troops, who work under AMISOM, are paid by the international community.

Some analysts say that despite progress in capturing villages controlled by Al-Shabaab, the Federal Government of Somalia does not have a clear plan on how to integrate them into the system.

UN Panel of Experts in November last year warned that Al-Shabaab militants had reverted to mafia-style taxation tactics to sustain their activities.

Nadav Argaman, who has been serving as head of Israel’s clandestine police force Shin Bet since 2016, on Wednesday warned members of the Political-Security cabinet of turning Hamas into a new Hezbollah should Israel not take steps to limit the terror organization’s buildup as part of the new arrangement deal in Gaza.

Argaman read to the prime minister, ministers and IDF chief of staff an article that was published in Yedioth Ahronoth that same day, about the way the Netanyahu government had dropped the ball regarding Hezbollah, allowing it to grow exponentially over the past decade, to the point where even an attempt to eradicate it would necessarily result in great civilian casualties on the Israeli side of the border. The Shin Bet chief warned against a similar development in the Gaza Strip.

He also reiterated his opposition to weakening the Palestinian Authority while strengthening Hamas and criticized Defense Minister Naftali Bennett’s decision to offset the transfer of money from Israel to the PA by the amount Ramallah spends on salaries to terrorists behind bars and the families of dead terrorists.

Argaman believes it is wrong to punish the PA that aids the Shin Bet and the IDF in countering terrorism in Judea and Samaria, while at the same time rewarding Hamas in the form of humanitarian relief. Argaman is concerned about losing the cooperation of the PA security force.

Nadav Argaman, 60, served previously as deputy head of the Shin Bet, as the force’s Operations Division chief, and as the Shin Bet representative in the United States. He was appointed to the top job by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February 2016.

In November 2012, at the beginning of Operation Pillar of Defense, Argaman commanded the assassination of Hamas military wing commander Ahmed Jabari.

According to a Wednesday report in Yedioth, the cabinet did not respond warmly to Argaman’s warning, as Minister Yoav Galant (formerly a candidate for IDF chief of staff), DM Bennett and PM Netanyahu all issued statements suggesting the calm in Gaza was more important than resolving the conflict with the PA.

The cabinet’s attitude is easily explained by the fact that a lot depends on peace along the Gaza border between now and March 2, election day. Should Hamas rock the boat again, threatening the lives of Israelis who live alongside the border fence, the Netanyahu government’s competence would be questioned, costing Likud and the rightwing coalition votes."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Maybe it's your job to look after your cousin for the day. Maybe your folks are finally checking out your new home. Either way, you've got a day to kill and Seattle is the city to do it.

Seattle's tourists attractions and proclivities towards its tourism have been well documented, it's still got quite a tourist track. And when you find lists of ""How do to Seattle in a day"" or ""Sights you definitely shouldn't miss"" there's always the usual suspects of spots to hit.

RELATED: Stupid things tourists do when first in Seattle

The qualifier I'd add is that very seldom can you hit all these spots in one day (in fact, arguably never). Even with the help of a car, good luck getting from Pike Place to Fremont to Cap Hill to Renton (if you wanna check out Jimi Hendrix's grave) in Seattle's not-quite-the-worst-in-the-world traffic.

No, Seattle is not a ""in one day"" kind of town; the best ones usually aren't. What you can do is break Seattle off into one day chunks, centered on a theme or locale.

22472,cf6364ddbbb0da26089abb126f3337fb,"I’ve read dozens of articles warning of Muslim immigrants rising up to take over the country, community by community, state by state. While I don’t doubt that some Muslims (maybe even a significant number) would like to see us fall to their swords, I wonder if there isn’t something even more sinister going on—something that also involves many of our actual government leaders and those who seek a different future for America.

What I’m talking about is a plan

Pitting foreigners against Americans isn’t as far-fetched as you might think. Before you, my favorite reader, write me off and send the boys in white to take me away, hear me out. It’s actually happened here before, not with Muslims, but with half-a-million foreign soldiers recruited to kill Americans—tens-of-thousands of them. What I’m referring to is the war between the states…the war of secession…the war of Northern aggression…or, as I like to call it, the War to defend Nullification.

Very interesting

This excerpt is from an article written by Don H. Doyle, an expert on the contributions of immigrants to the Union’s victory over the Confederate States: Against the Left: A Ro... Llewellyn H Rockwell Jr Best Price: $13.57 Buy New $8.00 (as of 10:15 EST - Details)

“In the summer of 1861, an American diplomat in Turin, Italy, looked out the window of the U.S. legation to see hundreds of young men forming a sprawling line. Some wore red shirts, emblematic of the Garibaldini who, during their campaign in southern Italy, were known for pointing one finger in the air and shouting l’Italia Unità! (Italy United!). Now they wanted to volunteer to take up arms for l’America Unità!

Meanwhile, immigrants already in the United States responded to the call to arms in extraordinary numbers. In 1860, about 13% of the U.S. population was born overseas—roughly what it is today. One in every four members of the Union armed forces was an immigrant, some 543,000 of the more than 2 million Union soldiers by recent estimates. Another 18% had at least one foreign-born parent. Together, immigrants and the sons of immigrants made up about 43% of the U.S. armed forces.

America’s foreign legions gave the North an incalculable advantage. It could never have won without them.”

In addition to those recruited to come to the US to fight the Confederacy, thousands of Germans had already arrived here after their failed “Revolution of 1848.”

Today, our nation is being flooded with poorly-educated, unskilled men of military age.

Let’s return to the writings of Don H. Doyle:

“In the 1860s, Confederate diplomats and supporters abroad were eager to inform Europeans that the North was actively recruiting their sons to serve as cannon fodder. In one pamphlet, Confederate envoy Edwin De Leon informed French readers that the Puritan North had built its army “in large part of foreign mercenaries” made up of “the refuse of the old world… Immigrants tended to be young and male.” (and I might add, unskilled at anything.)

22502,57c7e15388e6272fac44b46656ee0c58,"Adult survivors of sexual abuse may be given more time to bring civil claims against their accusers.

State Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, proposed the Adult Victims Act in the state Senate in the fall that would give one year for victims of sexual abuse whose abuse happened when they were over the age of 18 to bring claims against their alleged abusers. The legislation is co-sponsored by Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, D-Bronx.

The legislation, S.6810, allows claims in sexual abuse claims where the statute of limitations has run out. Claims under the Adult Victims Act would be given special trial preference and require the Chief Administrative Judge of the Office of Court Administration to develop rules so that cases brought under the Adult Victims Act are heard quickly.

Hoylman said New Jersey enacted legislation in 2019 that allowed a two-year window for time-barred sexual abuse claims to be revived in civil court for both child and adult victims.

“This legislation, the Adult Survivors Act, would create a one-year window for the revival of otherwise time-barred civil claims arising out of sexual offenses committed against people who were 18 or older at the time of the conduct,” Hoylman wrote in his legislative justification. “Those who have had justice denied them as a result of New York’s formerly insufficient statutes of limitations should be given the opportunity to seek civil redress against their abuser or their abuser’s enablers in a court of law.”

Hoylman said the fiscal impact of his proposal is still to be determined. One reason for that is it remains to be seen how Child Victims Act cases will be adjudicated and what the act’s impact will be on the institutions that are defending against civil lawsuits. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September to seek protection from creditors in relation to child sex abuse claims.

The Rochester diocese was the first diocese in New York state to file for bankruptcy protection and the 20th diocese nationally, according to the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle. The filing is to allow the diocese to reorganize its finances, raise money to pay fair compensation to sex-abuse accusers and create a plan for the diocese to continue operations much as they were before.

More than 900 cases have been filed statewide under the Child Victims Act, according to the Albany Times-Union. Some organizations are pushing for a separate fund to be created because too many claims are focused on institutions that have an ability to pay a civil claim. In September, the Fighting for Children PAC began advocating for legislation previously proposed by former state Sen. Catharine Young, R-Olean, to create a Child Victims Reconciliation and Compensation Fund. Young would have paid for her fund with $300 million in criminal asset forfeiture money held by the Manhattan District Attorney’s office.

Gary Greenberg, founder of the Fighting for Children PAC, wrote in a letter posted on the PAC’s Facebook page recently that an analysis of cases filed under the Child Victims Act found that 98.8 percent of the lawsuits filed are institutional cases in which the defendant is either an organization, corporation or other legal entity. A little more than 1% of cases have been filed against a private citizen.

“Hundreds, if not thousands of victims are being turned away by attorneys because their cases involve perpetrators who are not fiscally worthwhile to prosecute,” Greenberg said. “This is not justice for all. … The legislature and governor must correct this. My recommendation is to create a victims fund with public and private funds for those who, under the current law, are not able to go to court.”", Bring lawsuit against ,3

A firefighter was killed and 14 others injured when a battery factory collapsed in northwest Delhi's Peera Garhi following an explosion due to a fire that broke out early on Thursday morning, officials said.

As many as 18 people were rescued from the building, including two caretakers and a security guard, they added.

The deceased firefighter has been identified as Amit Balyan (20), who was admitted to Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal condoled his death and tweeted, ""It is with deep sadness I inform you that one of our firemen was martyred while saving people from fire.

A large portion of the two-storey building collapsed following an explosion when firefighters were dousing the blaze, an official said, adding that fire department had received a call at 4.23 am.

According to fire department officials, the fire has been brought under control but the cooling process is still underway. All the firemen, who were trapped under the debris, have been rescued.

Plumes of smoke billowed out from the building as the fire brigade personnel battled to contain the blaze. An eyewitness said several explosions were heard as the blaze gutted down the building.

Santosh Kumar, who works in a plastic factory nearby, said around 9 am, the back side of the building collapsed. ""Two to four persons were trapped still trapped inside the building and were heard screaming for help. The fire personnel rescued them with the help of a ladder. They were alive,"" he said.

A member of staff who had a criminal caution had started working at the school without proper safeguarding in place, a report said.

The Vale Of Evesham School on Four Pools Lane, Evesham provides education for pupils who have autism spectrum disorders and learning disabilities, also offering a boarding service for 15 children.

The Ofsted report released in November read: ""A prospective new member of staff in the school was dishonest on their application for their role. When the prospective new member of staff informed senior leaders that they had a criminal caution from the police, an assessment of risk was undertaken by management staff who were not qualified to do so.""

""As a result, the member of staff started employment without sufficient safeguards in place. Further to this, the school’s single central record for the staff was missing essential information. These shortfalls increase the potential for inappropriate and unsafe people to gain employment in the school and this means that children are potentially placed at unknown and unassessed risk.""

The report continued: ""Designated safeguarding leads have failed to follow procedures that are designed to keep children safe.""

""A member of staff was charged by police after being involved in a violent incident in public. Disciplinary proceedings were commenced, and the member of staff resigned from their post. Managers did not ensure that a referral was made to the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) following this safeguarding concern.""

Despite this the Ofsted report praised the school's ""homely feel"" and said the communal areas were ""clean and comfortable.""

The report also said the children the inspector spoke with were positive and enjoyed the range of activities and trips offered by the school. Feedback from parents is also positive, and the staff respond well to children’s health needs.

Executive Principal of The Vale of Evesham School Liz Hayward said the report had ""shocked and saddened"" staff.

""Following this devastating outcome, our focus for the immediate future is to systematically address the issues detailed in the report - indeed a number of these were addressed before the inspectors left the school on 7th November - and others were resolved in the immediate days and weeks following the inspection’s conclusion. We continue to work hard to rectify any further issues the inspection raised.""

""Our concerns also lie with the families of our students at what will be a worrying time for them. Vale of Evesham has built a strong positive reputation within the school and wider community over many years and while we fully acknowledge that we have issues to attend to, we seek to reassure families of our determination to move swiftly away from this judgement. We also want to reassure families of our students that Vale of Evesham school continues to be the safe and motivating school that their children enjoy attending.""

""We are extremely confident that the school will return to a positive outcome when Ofsted returns to undertake their monitoring visits in the spring or summer of 2020. We can be confident of rapid and sustained progress because Vale of Evesham staff remain highly skilled and continue to work with a clear focus on providing excellent educational opportunities for children and young people with additional needs."""," Threaten, not specified below",3

By Susan Mathew

Jan 2 (Reuters) - Fresh monetary stimulus in Beijing and growing Sino-U.S. trade optimism helped European shares stay close to record highs on Thursday with banks and technology stocks leading a broad-based rally.

Riding the high tide across global markets, the pan-European stocks index STOXX 600 jumped 0.9% after declining for two straight sessions when caution crept in about how long a U.S.-China trade truce would last.

But U.S. President Donald Trump brightened the mood on Tuesday by saying the Phase 1 agreement would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House.

""There is an ongoing view from the market that 2020 may feel better than 2019 did,"" said Will James, deputy head of European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""There is more of a value bias to the market (given the) positive noise around trade.""

Lenders were on a tear, up 1.9% at their highest in nearly eight months, followed by the technology sector that was driven by gains in trade-sensitive chip stocks.

China-exposed mining and auto shares were also among the biggest gainers along with industrials which were lifted by a 2.3% jump in Airbus after it edged out Boeing to become the world's biggest planemaker.

That lifted the wider French index 1.1%. Bank-heavy Spanish and Italian indices gained the most in the region, up around 1.4% each, while German shares posted their best day in one month, shrugging off figures that showed the manufacturing sector contracted further in December.

Euro zone stocks jumped 1.2% on Thursday despite latest data showing factory activity in the bloc contracting for the eleventh straight month.

The benchmark European STOXX 600 index ended last year with its biggest annual gain since the global financial crisis on easing recession fears and a loose monetary policy by some of the world's biggest central banks.

Signalling that it stood pat to boost a slowing economy, China's central bank on Wednesday lowered the reserve requirement ratio for banks for the eighth time since 2018, with the latest cut freeing up around 800 billion yuan ($115 billion).

London-listed shares climbed 0.8%. The other key date this month for European markets will be Jan. 31 - the deadline for Britain's exit from the European Union. Higher volatility during this period will also stem from companies starting to report fourth-quarter results and expectations for 2020.

Missing out on the broader rally, Tullow Oil Plc shares fell 6.8% an on doubts over commercial viability of a reservoir in its newly struck oil well in offshore Guyana.

22569,9ffb1f39d0f6f99232a24ddafd1f994c,"If the “science is settled” regarding global warming, climate change, extreme weather, or whatever it goes by these days, why are past predictions not more accurate?

Weather forecasting, although frequently off the mark, is usually fairly accurate. If snow is predicted, it typically falls. It may be a few inches more or less than predicted but it isn’t sunny and 80 degrees on a day a major snowstorm is forecast.

Yet climate, which is a longer-term measure of weather, cannot be predicted with any more accuracy than flipping a coin or throwing dice. Let’s look at some past predictions.

Almost twenty years ago, in 2004, the Guardian reported what U.S. defense officials at the Pentagon warned about the future climate:

Climate change over the next 20 years could result in a global catastrophe costing millions of lives in wars and natural disasters. A secret report, suppressed by US defense chiefs and obtained by The Observer, warns that major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a 'Siberian' climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world. The document predicts that abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The threat to global stability vastly eclipses that of terrorism, say the few experts privy to its contents.

As 2020 has just arrived, let’s see how those predictions turned out. For New Year’s Day, London is predicted to have a high of 46 degrees. While in Novosibirsk, the largest city in Siberia, the New Year’s Day high was only 23 degrees. So much for “Britain is plunged into a Siberian climate by 2020.”

London was Siberia at one time, but 200 years ago. Remember the snow and ice in Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol? “Dickens grew up during the coldest years of the Little Ice Age, between 1805 to 1820.”

YouTube screen grab

As to the “nuclear conflicts, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting,” I don’t see any of that either as 2020 arrives. Well, perhaps big media is rioting as its dreams of overturning the last election have been fruitless.

This climate prophesy also claimed, “As early as next year widespread flooding by a rise in sea levels will create major upheaval for millions.” One year after the 2004 report would be 2005, 15 years ago.

I don’t recall any rising sea levels or major upheavals, other than Hurricane Katrina, which flooded the below sea level city of New Orleans due to city officials not spending allocated monies on levee reinforcement. Don’t blame corrupt financial mismanagement of American cities on global warming.

One of the report’s authors warned, “It was already possibly too late to prevent a disaster happening. We don't know exactly where we are in the process. It could start tomorrow and we would not know for another five years.” Well it didn’t start tomorrow and five years later, in 2009, the only brewing disaster facing America was Obamacare.

There is a plethora of other failed catastrophic climate predictions. Thirty years ago, the Indian Ocean was to swallow the Maldives. Al Gore, in 2009, predicted the North Pole Ice cap would be melted within the next five to seven years. Yet the Maldives are still there and icebreakers are getting stuck in Arctic Sea ice.

Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford University biologist, wrote The Population Bomb in 1968. Among his predictions:

“The battle to feed all of humanity is over.” He later went on to forecast that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s, that 65 million of them would be Americans, that crowded India was essentially doomed, that odds were fair “England will not exist in the year 2000.” Dr. Ehrlich was so sure of himself that he warned in 1970 that “sometime in the next 15 years, the end will come.” By “the end,” he meant “an utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.”

The only end that is coming is for dirty deep state players, assuming Barr and Durham do their jobs. But England is alive and well, and soon leaving the EU. India seems to be thriving too. It wasn’t a population bomb but instead a prediction bomb.

Speaking of England, Prince Charles has been predicting the end of the world as often as MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow has been telling everyone that Trump is about to be found guilty of collusion, treason, tax evasion, and coloring his hair.

In July 2009, the good prince predicted there were only 96 months to save the world. That’s eight years, or July 2017, just a couple of months after Robert Mueller began his investigation witch-hunt against President Trump. It wasn’t the end of the world, only the end of Rachel Maddow and the credibility of her fellow “journalists.”.

In 2015, Charles extended the deadline by 33 years. How generous. Too bad he didn’t give his brother, Andrew, a 33-year extension to talk his way out of his Jeffrey Epstein mess.

This year, the Prince of Wales changed his tune again, “Warning that if we don’t tackle climate change in 18 months the human race will go extinct.” If the prince doesn’t get a handle on his brother and his underage girls, the royal family may go extinct within 18 months.

One year ago, Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told us the world will end in 12 years. Now we are down to 11 years. The failed or flailing Democrat presidential candidates agree.

Beto O’Rourke says, “We don't have more than 10 years to get this right."" Mayor Pete is a bit more generous, saying, ""Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate."" Andrew Yang threw in the towel, announcing, “We are 10 years too late. We need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction, but we also need to start moving our people to higher ground.""

Why don’t they all give it up and stop trying to predict the unpredictable? The IPCC acknowledges, “The climate system is a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”

We can only predict the obvious, that the climate does change over time. Cooling leads to ice ages and warming melts the ice, as has been occurring on the planet for millions of years. This has been happening long before humans roamed the Earth, drove SUVs, and grilled burgers in their backyards.

We don’t even know what normal climate is. Is today colder than normal or warmer? Not over the past hundred years but over the past hundred million years.

For those who claim to know the unknowable, I say “How dare you,” borrowing the catch phrase of the world’s foremost climate expert, a bratty teenager from Sweden.

22609,6497ce7d71fa4d65303f2f22b50b8c91,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups who stormed the U.S. Embassy’s perimeter and hurled rocks in two days of protests withdrew on Wednesday after Washington dispatched extra troops and threatened reprisals against Tehran.

The demonstrators, angry at U.S. air strikes against the Tehran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group in which at least 25 people were killed, threw stones at the building while U.S. forces stationed on the rooftops fired tear gas to disperse them.

By mid-afternoon, most appeared to have obeyed a call to withdraw, issued by the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) umbrella group of mainly Shi’ite militia, which said the demonstrators’ message had been heard.

Young men used palm tree branches to sweep the street in front of the embassy compound. Others packed up equipment and vans arrived to take people away. Some left to set up a protest camp in front of a nearby hotel.

Iraq’s military said all protesters had left by the evening.

The protests marked a new turn in the shadow war between Washington and Tehran playing out across the Middle East.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces a re-election campaign in 2020, accused Iran of orchestrating the violence. He threatened on Tuesday to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want war.

Iran, under severe economic duress from punishing U.S. sanctions put in place by Trump, denied responsibility.

The unrest followed U.S. air raids on Sunday against Kataib Hezbollah bases in retaliation for missile attacks that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq last week.

On Tuesday, crowds chanted: ‘Death to America!’, lit fires, and smashed surveillance cameras. They breached an outer perimeter of the embassy but did not enter the main compound.

BIGGEST U.S. EMBASSY

The huge embassy, built along the banks of the Tigris River in central Baghdad’s fortified “green zone” during the American occupation following the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, is the biggest U.S. diplomatic mission in the world.

Washington said its diplomats were safe and it was rushing hundreds of extra troops to the region.

The State Department said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decided to postpone his upcoming trip to Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Cyprus to remain in Washington and monitor the situation in Iraq. [L1N29606E]

Pompeo spoke on Wednesday with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the State Department said.

Pompeo said on Twitter that Abdul Mahdi had agreed that Iraq “would continue to uphold its responsibility to keep U.S. personnel secure and would move the Iran-backed attackers away from @USEmbBaghdad.”

Pompeo wrote on Twitter he thanked the emir in the call “for Qatar’s solidarity in the face of Iran’s malign regional influence,” including the attack on the embassy in Baghdad.

The embassy said all public consular operations were suspended and all future appointments cancelled.

The anti-American action came after months of protests in Iraq against the government and the Iran-backed militias that support it. Many Iraqis complain their country has become a battlefield for a proxy war for influence between Washington and Tehran, and that their leaders are too beholden to outside powers.

Iraq’s government has long faced frictions in its close relations with the two foes. Trump spoke to Abdul Mahdi on Tuesday and demanded Iraq protect the embassy.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday condemned the U.S. attacks. Iran summoned a Swiss envoy, who represents U.S. interests in Tehran, to complain about what it described as “warmongering” words from Washington.

U.S. officials said 750 extra troops would initially be based out of Kuwait and as many as 4,000 troops could be sent to the region in coming days.

More than 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq supporting local forces. The air strikes have galvanized calls inside Iraq to expel them.

Many in the crowd outside the embassy said ending Washington’s presence in Iraq was their main goal.

‘DEVIL’S DEN’

Despite decades of enmity between Iran and the United States, Iran-backed militias and U.S. forces found themselves on the same side during Iraq’s 2014-2017 war against Islamic State fighters, with both powers helping the government recapture territory from militants who had overrun a third of Iraq.

Since then, U.S. troops have yet to leave, while the Iran-backed militias have been incorporated into the security forces.

Abdul Mahdi, who has announced plans to step down in the face of anti-government protests in which more than 450 people were killed, is backed by Iran and its allies.

The militia may have decided to pull back from the embassy to avoid making him look weak or to avert clashes with government forces.

Overnight, demonstrators pitched tents and camped outside the embassy walls, then brought food, cooking equipment and mattresses during the morning, indicating plans to stay before the withdrawal call.

“Our sit-in is eternal, until this devil’s den is closed off forever, but don’t give anyone an excuse to make your protest violent. Don’t clash with security,” one protest leader told the crowd from a stage erected at the embassy before the departure.", Accuse of aggression,3

22670,62d2ac5ff6859de24f2f1c8adae6846e,"WOOLWICH — Three people went to the hospital after a head-on crash on Route 1 near Dairy Queen just before 7 p.m. Saturday.

As a result of the crash, the Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office charged Carolyn Mitchell, 73, of Portland with operating after the influence.

Chief Deputy Brett Strout said Mitchell was driving a 2017 Volkswagen south on Route 1.

“According to witnesses, the Volkswagen driven by Mitchell swerved into the northbound lane of travel,” he said.

She allegedly hit a northbound vehicle head-on, spun around and hit a second northbound vehicle, Strout said.

The other vehicles were driven by Nicholas Clark, 19, of Wiscasset and Jamie Haven, 19, of South Berwick.

Mitchell and a passenger in Haven’s vehicle, 19-year-old Evan Joyce of Dover, New Hampshire, were taken to Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick where they were treated and released.

Haven was taken to Maine Medical Center in Portland and was treated and released.

Woolwich selectmen asked the Maine Department of Transportation to conduct a safety audit of Route 1 near the Taste of Maine Restaurant after a fatal crash there in July, a mile from the Dairy Queen where Saturday’s crash happened. William Young, 55, of Topsham allegedly caused a head-on crash that claimed the life of 58-year-old Barry Wyman of Woolwich.

Young was arrested last month on charges of manslaughter, reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon, driving to endanger and criminal speed after he was indicted by a Sagadahoc County Grand Jury.

According to the Department of Transportation, as of July there had been 94 crashes over the past 5 years within a 2-mile stretch of Route 1 north of the Sagadahoc Bridge. Two of those crashes were fatal, killing three people and injuring three more. Of those 94 crashes, 65 didn’t involve injuries.

“It’s not a high crash area by our standards,” said Paul Merrill, spokesman for the Maine Department of Transportation, in July.

High crash locations are single intersections or stretches of road where there have been at least eight crashes over a three year period, according to DOT. Only the Route 1 and Nequasset Road intersection meets that threshold.

Tuesday, Merrill said there’s nothing the DOT could do to stop someone from drinking and driving.

However, he said the DOT is aware of the number of crashes that have happened along the stretch of Route 1 and in the area of the 86-year-old bridge by the Taste of Maine Restaurant the department plans to replace or rehabilitate.

“We’re aware that there have been crashes in that area and it’s something we continue to look at as we look to future plans for that bridge and the roads leading up to it on either side,” he said.

The bridge carries an average of 19,000 vehicles per day.

Woolwich residents told the state at a meeting last month that they want safety for drivers and cyclists at the forefront of the plans for the new bridge.

Reuters, citing local media reports, said up to 40,000 turkeys could be culled in the coming days to prevent a further outbreak.

This is the first outbreak of the bird flu since France culled 800,000 birds to prevent the spread of H5N8 in 2017.

Andrzej Danielak, president of the Polish Association of Breeders and Poultry Producers, said three large scale farms, in close proximity of each other, have detected an outbreak of the deadly virus -- puts at least 350,000 turkeys at risk.

22914,9d69ea4af92eaa54d9484731b55d7ea9,"Nearly three-fourths of homeless young adults don’t seek medical care after being raped, according to a Houston-led survey that reveals missed opportunities to reduce the population’s risk of contracting the virus that causes AIDS or developing an unintended pregnancy.

Survey participants, located in Houston and six other large cities, most frequently cited a desire not to involve the legal system as their primary reason for not going to the emergency room after sexual assault, even though such interventions are not a necessary component of such visits.

“It’s unfortunate that many victims believe the myth that you have to file a police report when you go to the ER,” said Diane Santa Maria, interim dean of the UTHealth School of Nursing and senior author of an article about the survey, published this month in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. “The reality is you can be treated for HIV and unintended pregnancy prevention and leave.”

The treatment — post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent the human immunodeficiency virus, the morning-after pill to prevent pregnancy — are highly effective if taken soon after a rape, Santa Maria noted. Homeless young adults carry a high burden of HIV compared to the general population, she said.

Santa Maria said the survey’s biggest surprise was that 44 percent of respondents didn’t seek care because they feared subsequent legal involvement. She was not surprised the survey showed most young homeless adults don’t seek care after rape, she said.

The second most common reason survey respondents didn’t visit a medical provider after rape was a view that it wasn’t important. Thirty-five percent of respondents gave that reason.

The survey, the first to look at the care of homeless rape victims, found one in four in the population are raped within two years of becoming homeless, a number consistent with previous research into sexual assault in homeless young adults. By comparison, one in five women overall will be raped at some point in their life, according to published data.

Santa Maria calls homeless young adults “a hidden population hard to reach.” The survey is part of her ongoing research into how to better help them.

STUDY: New tool better at identifying human trafficking

The survey findings conform to her experience, said Leslie Bourne, executive director of the Covenant House Texas, the Houston-based shelter for homeless, abused and abandoned young adults.

“The population is so used to bad stuff happening to them that they learn to live with and deal with it, as if it’s not a big deal,” Bourne said. “Plus, they have trust issues so they’re not eager to report things like sexual assault.”

The survey, conducted on tablets between June 2016 and July 2017, was completed by 1,405 adults between 18 and 26 years of age experiencing homelessness in Houston, Los Angeles, San Jose, Phoenix, St. Louis, Denver and New York City. Roughly 200 adults per city took the survey.

The survey identified 337 participants who reported being raped. The rates were highest in people of mixed race, LGBQ and transgender youth and those who were victims of childhood sexual abuse and sex trafficking. Thirty-seven percent of cisgender women and 15 percent of cisgender men in the survey reported they were rape victims.

Denver had the lowest rate of respondents reporting rape, 16 percent. The Houston rate, 26 percent, was on par with most of the other cities.

Only 98 of the 337 received a post-rape exam. Hispanic victims were the most likely to get an exam and mixed race victims the least likely. Houston victims were more likely to seek care — 41 percent to San Jose’s 20 percent, for instance — but the numbers were not statistically significant.

Besides fear of the legal system and not thinking it was important, other reasons survey respondents gave for not seeking care were that they didn’t know they should go in for care; they didn’t where to go; they didn’t have insurance; and they couldn’t safely leave given their circumstance. The last category was most commonly cited by those with a history of sex trafficking.

PEP is effective at preventing the transmission of HIV more than 90 percent of the time if given within 72 hours of sexual activity. It can be given after that window, but effectiveness drops. The morning-after pill is best given within 24 hours, but it can work up to 72 hours after.

Santa Maria said the best way to clear up misconceptions that it’s not important to seek care after rape or that medical providers must report it to the police is for educators to start teaching students at the junior high and high school level. She also called for more health care providers to receive sex assault care training and for an increase in the number of sexual assault nurse examiners.

“There’s a lot we can do to help,” said Santa Maria. “We need to respond better as a community, do a better job of educating providers, make sure they know where to send victims. The bottom line is that the trends identified in this survey have to change.”

22946,8ab0c4edcfc2570b2a1c70ba33d28833,"Premier Blaine Higgs says a byelection win for the Opposition Liberals in the riding of Saint Croix would lead to an early provincial election and a risk of the Liberals returning to power by the end of 2020.

Higgs says he will warn voters in the riding against splitting their votes between his Progressive Conservatives and the People's Alliance, a split that could help the Liberals win the seat.

While he wants to avoid going to the polls in 2020, a Liberal win in Saint​ Croix ""would probably put me there. I wouldn't have a choice.

""That is obviously in the back of my mind.""

Liberal victories there and in another expected byelection in Shediac Bay-Dieppe would shift the standings in the legislature.

The Liberals and Greens would have a combined 25 seats to 24 for the PCs and the Alliance.

That would make it unlikely the PC minority government could win confidence votes and pass legislation even with the support of the Alliance.

""The decision [for voters in Saint Croix] is probably not so much 'Do I support the Alliance over the PCs' or vice versa,"" Higgs said in a year-end interview. ""It's 'Do I really want to take a chance of the Liberals getting back in government?'""

Higgs's comments raise the stakes for the Saint Croix byelection, which he hasn't called yet.

The riding stretches from the village of McAdam to the Bay of Fundy, including the towns of St. Stephen and Saint Andrews.

It has been vacant since the death of PC MLA and cabinet minister Greg Thompson last September.

Will set date by March

Higgs has until March to set a date for the vote. He plans to schedule the byelection for Shediac Bay-Dieppe at the same time.

He said his choice of a date will be based in part on the possibility that losing both ridings would lead to a full provincial campaign.

The Saint Croix byelection will be the first time PC and Alliance candidates campaign against each other while the parties are co-operating in the legislature.

Normally a candidate for the governing party argues during a byelection campaign that he or she will be in the best position to influence government decisions.

But with the Alliance propping up the Tories in exchange for a role in decision-making, the Alliance candidate will be able to make the same case in Saint Croix.

While you can go chasing what might be the possibility of a majority, what we do know right now is we have the possibility to influence the outcome of the province for the better. - Blaine Higgs, premier

Asked how the PCs will counter that argument, Higgs invoked the risk of a vote split between the two parties.

""What we're going to both have to face is the risk of a Liberal candidate or a Green candidate winning, particularly a Liberal candidate,"" he said.

This isn't the first time Higgs has threatened an early election. In December he said he'd consider a bill on essential services in nursing homes to be a confidence matter. The bill passed with the support of the Alliance.

But this warning is different because it is aimed at voters, not a handful of MLAs in the legislature.

Despite the high stakes, the premier says he doesn't plan to back away from tough decisions because of the by-election, including planned health reforms to be announced early in the year.

""We're not going to shy away from them. I hope to be able to communicate in a way that people understand the rationale behind everything we do. I would never suggest that means everyone will like it. It's just that they'll understand why.""

The premier insisted that he doesn't want an early election, even if some of his advisers believe he'd likely win a majority.

He said so far he's been able to get most of his agenda passed by the legislature, and given how polls can change during a campaign, that would be at risk if he called an election.

""I'm kind of a believer that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, that old adage,"" Higgs said. ""While you can go chasing what might be the possibility of a majority, what we do know right now is we have the possibility to influence the outcome of the province for the better.

""If it becomes unworkable, it's a different story.""

Vote split warning is 'old argument'

One such unworkable outcome would be a defeat in Saint Croix. The PCs won the riding easily in 2018 but four years earlier, the Liberals won the riding, despite a larger combined PC-Alliance vote.

The Alliance plans to run high-profile former wildlife biologist Rod Cumberland in the byelection.

Alliance Leader Kris Austin brushed off Higgs's talk of a vote split, saying that argument ""has been used, it's been done, it's an old argument.""

He said his party doesn't only draw support from unhappy PCs, and its success in the last election has forced the Higgs government to be more accountable.

""I've always said you should vote for the best candidate and the best policies that line up with your views.""

Another variable in the Saint Croix byelection is the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which has vowed to get involved in the campaign and work against the PCs as a response to Higgs's rejection of large wage increases for nursing-home workers.

Yet another factor could be complaints by some members of the PC riding association that a potential nomination candidate was rejected by a party vetting committee without explanation. The association president resigned earlier this week.

'Environment prompted the resignation'

Association president Vernon Card resigned this week, telling fellow PC members in an email that he was questioning the ""positive characteristics"" of the party.

He said in an email Wednesday that while the rejection of candidate Lorraine Gilmore Peters was ""concerning, it was small compared to the overall environment. This environment prompted the resignation.""

He would not do an interview and said he would elaborate in a blog post in late January or early February.

The next provincial budget will be introduced March 10, the same month Higgs plans to call the by-elections--though he is free to pick a date months later.

The PCs have scheduled their convention to nominate a candidate for Jan. 18. The Liberals have not set a date for their convention.

The other riding where a byelection must be called, Shediac Bay-Dieppe, became vacant when former premier Brian Gallant resigned last October. It's expected to stay Liberal."," Threaten, not specified below",3
23008,c515fab1a84eebdefff749f6c5e1926e,"Within our body, simple sugars such as glucose, mannose and fucose connect together to create the complex polysaccharides or glycans that adorn all cell surfaces in a thick coat of sugars. But unlike the genome and the proteome, the glycome is still somewhat a mystery – in part because the chemistry of glycans is so complex. Our bodies synthesise thousands of unique glycans, but there are few analytical methods that can effectively elucidate their structures. And unlike DNA and proteins, which are assembled linearly, glycans are highly branched, making them hard to synthesise. But clever chemistry is providing solutions and bringing us closer to cracking the sugar code.

The oligosaccharides, mostly attached to proteins and lipids, have been the neglected biopolymers of biological research. But Geert-Jan Boons from the University of Georgia in the US says this may be changing. ‘I think over the last 10 years, it has become clear that these carbohydrates are involved in almost every healthy, as well as disease, process.’ Cells’ sugar coatings provide a unique cellular barcode, allowing the immune system to recognise other cells, including foreign invaders. It’s well established that aberrant glycosylation seems to drive cancer progression, specifically hypersialylation – the over-abundance of the nine-carbon backbone sugar sialic acid, found attached to glycan chains’ outermost ends.

The glycome is not directly coded by the genome

The long-term ambition for those in the field is to fully define the glycome – the structure and function of the complete set of glycans produced in a given cell or organism. But this is a little more complicated than defining the genome or proteome, explains Sabine Flitsch, a carbohydrate chemist from the University of Manchester in the UK. ‘The glycome is not directly coded by the genome; you can’t link sugar structure to one particular protein [or gene].’ Glycosylation – the addition of glycans – is a post-translational modification and the over 200 enzymes that assemble sugars do not provide a template, says Boons. ‘[The enzymes] and the availability of sugar nucleotides determines what types of structures are biosynthesised.’

On top of the lack of code, the number of possible glycans is overwhelming. Starting with the 10 common monosaccharides, the potential structures are exponentially greater than those for DNA or proteins. Hexasacchrides, made from six sugar molecules, can adopt 193 billion possible structures. And there are multiple different kinds of glycans , including N -linked oligosaccharides attached to the amino acid asparagine, O -linked oligosaccharides attached to threonine or serine and glycosaminoglycans – long highly polar polysaccharides that act as biological lubricants (an example being heparin, the blood thinner that prevents clots).

Synthetic challenge

Extracting pure glycans from nature is often not possible, so it is chemists who are called upon to synthesise the vast array of possible glycans. But that’s not easy, as they exhibit multiple forms of isomerism. Glycans have numerous arrangement of monosaccharides and variations in branching. Isomers can be based on differing ring sizes, and differing substitution positions (regioisomers). ‘You also [have to] get the stereochemistry of the linkage right – the alpha or beta linkage, which is probably one of the biggest challenges,’ says Flitsch. In glycosylation, a carbohydrate (the glycosyl donor) is attached to a hydroxyl of another sugar (the glycosyl acceptor) creating an anomeric carbon, which allows conversion between two possible configurations. The final product can be in the alpha or beta conformation. ‘You can chemically get selectivity only if you do extensive protection group chemistry,’ explains Flitsch. ‘Each coupling step costs you about seven chemical steps.’

One approach to speeding things up is automation using solid supports. Peter Seeberger, from the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam, Germany, founded GlycoUniverse in 2013. The company has created the Glyconeer, an automated oligosaccharide synthesiser, and eight are currently in use around the world.1 ‘The trick in solid state synthesis is that your first building block is attached to a non-soluble polymer, little beads of polystyrene in most cases,’ explains Mario Salwiczek, head of science at GlycoUniverse. ‘And the good thing is that you can wash away all the reactants that have not reacted or all the side products that have formed and you don’t have to do a purification step in between every coupling.’

The longest chains Seeberger has made with the approach are linear 50-sugar oligosaccharide but chains of 6–10 sugars are more typical. ‘Obviously, the technology itself cannot solve the chemistry problems that everybody’s facing,’ Salwiczek notes. One strategy has been to develop generic building blocks of multiple sugars. ‘The solutions that we came up with was clever picking of building blocks,’ says Boons. ‘Oligosaccharides are structurally very complex, but if you look at them carefully, you see certain motifs that are being put together in different ways.’

Boons and others have synthesised such motifs that can then be assembled in multiple ways. Synthetic heparin, made from 20 disaccharides was synthesised this way;2 ‘Those 20 disaccharides were assembled in the end from only six different monosaccharides,’ he says.

Biocatalysis

The other major advance has been the use of glycosyltransferases – the enzymes that transfer monosaccharides from activated sugar mono- or diphosphonucleotides to oligosaccharide chains. In the 1980s the approach was shown to be useful for synthesising complex glycans with each linkage being synthesised by a different enzyme.

What basically took a PhD to synthesise five or six years ago, we do now in the weekend

‘The advantage of these enzymes is that they completely take care of any regio- and stereoselectivity. They take two generic building blocks, and put them together in a very specific way,’ says Flitsch. Both the α- or β-anomers can be made, depending on the nucleotide acceptor. ‘Where you need to have seven steps [with a chemical synthesis], you can do this all in one step,’ adds Flitsch. Chemists are aided in designing syntheses by a database of CAZy enzymes – carbohydrate active enzymes. ‘I don’t say it’s complete,’ explains Flitsch. ‘But we have a fairly good understanding of which enzymes are involved in these biosyntheses.’

‘What basically took a PhD to synthesise five or six years ago, we do now in the weekend,’ says Boons. ‘But the drawback is, if you want to make an unnatural structure and structures that may have more drug-like properties, the enzymes don’t like it.’ He has been trying to get round this by combining chemistry with enzymes. For example, he has synthesised N -glycans with up to four different branches in only 10 chemical and enzymatic steps.

His approach used a symmetric bi-antennary glycosyl derivative building block, isolated from egg yolk powder. He then created an intermediate structure adding an unnatural sugar-nucleotide donor, 5’-disphospho-N -trifluoroacetyl glucosamine. When enzymes are used to further extend the glycan branches, the unnatural molecule is inert to enzymatic action, so further reactions occur selectively at other branches. The unnatural glucosamine is then converted into its natural counterpart, allowing for further enzymatic reactions. Boons calls the strategy ‘stop and go’.3 ‘We really believe that the combination of enzymes and chemistry is revolutionising making these molecules,’ he says.

Analysis in paralysis

Synthesising glycans is only part of the story – it also crucial to be able to analyse them. As well as helping to define the human glycome, it’s important for biopharmaceuticals. Many biological drugs are glycosylated; for example, erythropoietin, the infamous performance-enhancing drug known as EPO, which stimulates red blood cell production. ‘If you don’t glycosylate it, it’s just not active in humans,’ says Flitsch. But trying to analyse the glycan structure is not simple and makes copying biological drugs difficult. ‘The generic [drug] companies are very keen on getting better analytical methods,’ Flitsch adds.

It can be quite challenging to analyse a simple trisaccharide

Most existing analytical techniques have problems when it comes to glycans. Current methods often involve separation techniques interfaced with mass spectrometry. But chromatography protocols were designed with peptides in mind. ‘Sugars are more polar than peptides and as a result, established reverse-phase separation techniques actually do not work properly for sugars,’ says Kevin Pagel, an organic chemist from the Freie Universität Berlin in Germany. The isomerism found with monosaccharides themselves (glucose, galactose and fructose have the same empirical formula) and in their organisation makes mass spectroscopy analysis by mass/charge ratio sometimes impossible. NMR also can’t distinguish stereochemical details. ‘It can be quite challenging to analyse a simple trisaccharide,’ says Pagel.

While N -glycans are better characterised, O -linked glycans are more problematic. Mucins, the large, densely glycosylated proteins with very long glycan chains found in mucus, are a big challenge. Glysoaminoglycans are also hard to analyse, which explains the problems experienced with heparin. In 2008 contaminated heparin caused the deaths of more than 200 people globally due to the manufacturer substituting in a non-active compound, indistinguishable in routine testing.

‘What we really want is something that we can use for everything, that’s sort of universal,’ says Flitsch. ‘At the moment we are at the cusp of being able to do this.’ One technique that may help is ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) – used by airport security to screen for explosives. In combination with mass spectrometry it’s able to distinguish between gas-phase ions based on their mass, charge, size and shape. ‘Different isomers typically have a different size and shape’, Pagel explains, making the method ideal for glycans.

Ions are guided through a gas (helium or nitrogen), under the influence of a weak electric field, and their collision rate will vary, with larger cross-section molecules colliding more frequently and having longer drift times. In tandem with mass spectroscopy, it can distinguish between different isomers of smaller intact glycans.

Fragmenting large glycans before carrying out ion mobility measurements offers something close to a universal sequencing method, using only a limited set of standard fragment fingerprint spectra. ‘It’s sort of like a shotgun sequencing approach,’ says Flitsch. Crucially, carbohydrate fragments seem to retain a memory of their stereochemistry. ‘It will look different, depending if it comes from an alpha or beta linkage – that’s another key step for a sequencing protocol,’ she adds.

There are huge individual differences between people’s glycomes

Another important advance is infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. Using a high-intensity laser, an IR spectrum is indirectly measured by observing the disassociation of bonds as they absorb photons. Measuring the fragmentation yield (with a mass spectrometer) as a function of wavelength generates a vibrational spectrum . But there is a drawback: ‘At room temperature the spectral signatures that are obtained are often not very diagnostic because they are typically very broad,’ Pagel explains.

‘What we did for the very first time is to do the experiment with sugars at ultra-cold temperatures,’ says Pagel. ‘We obtained vibrational fingerprints which were incredibly well resolved, which were in fact so well resolved that we were able to disentangle any structural detail in a glycan.’ By cooling the ions in superfluidic helium droplets they reach a temperature of 0.4K and a very low energy state, resulting in a very high resolution spectra.4 Pagel has been able to unambiguously distinguish between a series of trisaccharide isomers that in some cases differed in nothing more than the stereochemistry of a single hydroxyl group.

So combining these new methods, will glycan sequencing become a reality? ‘I think we are beginning to get the synthetic capabilities to pull that off,’ says Boons, although Pagel still thinks sequencing the full human glycome may still be a challenge in 20 years. Unlike DNA and proteins, the glycome is highly dynamic. ‘There are huge individual differences between people’s glycomes,’ notes Flitsch. While DNA differences only occur every thousand residues, the glycome is strongly dependent on environment.

Microarrays

Acknowledging this problem, Lara Mahal from the University of Alberta in Canada, a pioneer in microarray methods for glycan recognition, has a different take on the glycome – she isn’t sure that we actually need it. ‘For a very long time, the community was going after the idea that we needed discreet structures and every single bit of that structure, but if you look at nature, nature doesn’t necessarily care about one discrete structure, nature cares about a collection of structures that do a particular function,’ argues Mahal. ‘The question is, do we need each individual structure [or] can we get a sense of the sub-structural changes?’

To this end Mahal and others are focused on developing microarrays that can study glycan–protein interactions using high-throughput automation. Such arrays arrange various glycans in tiny spots immobilised on a solid support, to be incubated with glycan-binding proteins, cells or even whole viruses. Binding is observed using fluorescent tags.

One of the first methods for immobilising glycans was developed by Ten Feizi at Imperial College London, UK, in the early 2000s. She attached lipid linkers to glycans creating ‘neoglycolipids’, which could then be immobilised to a nitocellulose surface. ‘With covalent array, it’s not very easy to control the density of glycans on the slide,’ says Yan Liu, who heads Imperial’s Carbohydrate Microarray Facility. If glycans are too crowded, or not clustered in the right way, the conditions may not be right for binding. Using neoglycolipids, the glycans are non-covalently bonded to the matrix surface and seem to be able to move and cluster – better mimicking glycan arrangements on cell surfaces. ‘This type of presentation is very good for many types of endogenous and viral glycan binding proteins and very sensitive for antibodies,’ says Liu.

I think it’s probably fair to say carbohydrate chemistry really stretches organic chemistry to its limits

The first method for linking the lipids was reductive amination – a condensation reaction between a primary amine group and the glycan, but this results in ring opening of core monosaccharides, which is a disadvantage for short-chain glycans. In 2007 Liu devised an alternative oxime ligation method.5 The lipid was modified to include an amino-oxy group which was conjugated to form a stable oxime linkage (RHC=NOR′). With this method, ‘we have substantially broadened the scope of the neoglycolipid-based microarray system by providing access to short oligosaccharides and core-branched glycans for ligand-binding studies,’ Liu says.

The glycan library at Imperial is the largest in Europe and has about 1000 sequences – available for all researchers to test against. But there are gaps, with potentially 7000 human recognisable glycans (the actual number isn’t known). ‘I think we’re missing a lot,’ says Liu. ‘On the other hand, we can say we have the major capping groups of these glycans which play important roles for many recognition systems.’

The approach Mahal has taken uses microarrays to find biomarkers for disease, including cancer.6 In the mid-2000s she started to develop high throughput arrays of lectins – carbohydrate-binding plant proteins. ‘Nature has already evolved proteins that have very specific molecular recognition surfaces,’ explains Mahal. ‘They are really good at recognising the difference between, for example, sialic acid that has an alpha-2,6 linkage to a galactose and sialic acid that has an alpha-2,3 linkage. It can tell very immediately those two differences, which is something you cannot tell easily by mass spectrometry.’ Using this approach doesn’t confirm exact structures but ‘it gives us a very rapid way of being able to determine how sugars are changing,’ says Mahal. ‘And that’s really what you care about.’

Mahal’s team have also been trying to understand how glycosylation is controlled in biology and have linked it back to micro-RNA – the small non-coding RNA molecules that silence RNA and regulate post-transcriptional gene expression. Mahal thinks this mechanism controls the transferase enzymes that lead to glycosylation.7 ‘We’re trying to figure out the complete micro-RNA regulation of glycosylation enzymes as a first step towards fixing some of those things,’ says Mahal.

Clearly, both in terms of mapping the glycome and understanding the underpinning biology, there is a long way to go. ‘I think it’s probably fair to say carbohydrate chemistry really stretches organic chemistry to its limits,’ muses Flitsch. But Mahal cautions against seeing glycomics as an insurmountably large scientific mountain. ‘I think one of the problems with glycomics has always been that people have this perception that it is somehow hard, and I would challenge that… because realistically [in biology] what isn’t complex?’

23265,7c4798bb30ab8ea6d0bcec53e378c9c4,"The dangers around the corner with cannabis use

THE EDITOR: The loosening up of the law on cannabis possession and use means that more people will use cannabis. The adverse physical and mental health effects will therefore be greater in the longer term. People who were not normally inclined to try cannabis will be under greater social influence to try it. Many will get hooked.

The Hansard up to the second reading of The Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Bill, 2019 is good reading. Most people have neither time nor inclination to read these things.

I have to commend my medical colleague, Senator Dr Varma Deyalsingh, for his strenuous efforts in informing the House of the dangers of decriminalising cannabis. The good doctor’s knowledge and experience shone but fell by the wayside, as expedience applied to declogging a failed and starved criminal justice system took priority.

Deyalsingh rightly told everyone of the serious physical and mental health problems that are associated with cannabis use. He spoke well to the cognitive and behavioural changes seen in those who used cannabis on a regular basis. However, Deyalsingh said in closing:

“So in conclusion I am thinking we have been given this legislation but we will have to be a little careful, we do not know what is coming around the corner, what dangers are there and I am thinking that we have to prepare for it and safeguard our youths by putting certain things in place. Thank you, Mr Vice-President.”

I think that we need to be more than “a little careful.” It was surprising that Deyalsingh did not know “what dangers are there” when he had spelled out the risks so very well.

I know exactly what is around the corner, considering the well-known dangers. Here is my forecast for the next 15 years if cannabis remains decriminalised in TT, all else remaining the same as today.

1. Upward pressure on the homicide rate.

2. Upward pressure on the overall crime rate.

3. There will be an increase in drug-driving incidents as a category and more road deaths related to cannabis use (unlikely to be detected as such).

4. There will be an increase in private drug parties across the country.

5. The police will find their hands even more full in fighting all the above.

6. The ailing court system will have temporary relief from hitherto minor cannabis related offences but then see more serious related offences.

7. The mental health of people and the nation will suffer.

8. Cancers caused by cannabis use will increase.

9. Life expectancy will be lost among certain population groups, especially younger people.

10. Gross domestic product is likely to face downward pressure.

11. Lawyers stand to make more money.

I can reasonably infer all of the above – as can all people applying basic common sense. One does not need to be a medical doctor or mental health expert to foresee these things.

Some will argue that education programmes on the harmful effects of cannabis will limit its use. To what extent? If it was that simple, then your government could easily have done all that educating 20 years ago and avoided most of the problems associated with cannabis use. Education programmes will fail miserably as new social pressures and encouragements to use cannabis emerge.

TT is obviously not the UK, Netherlands or other First World countries that have the sort of resources to detect and manage people who use cannabis. But even in First World nations, there have been increases in “drug-driving” offences and related deaths.

It’s often thrown around at various health campaigns, “No health without mental health.” But they don’t show the fine print: “...subject to politricks and the greater good; minorities shall suffer.”

The bottom line is that the legislation is good for clearing the dog house in which the legal system has been forced to live in over the last 30 years. This new amendment to the law is dangerous to the health of people and that of the nation. The perceived good to be derived for the many – largely about false economics – will cost a significant minority. They will not find their “equal place.”

All rise and hypocritically sing your national anthem.

Was shot three times in back at bar during New Year's party

PRINEVILLE, Ore. (KTVZ) -- A Bend man who was left paralyzed in a shooting at a Prineville bar's New Year's Eve party two years ago has sued his attacker for more than $21.5 million.

Nicholas Ricks filed the lawsuit Monday in Crook County Circuit Court agains Omar Ramzi Araim, who shot Ricks three times in the back during a party at the Croosroads BBQ Pit and Pub.

Ricks helped break up a fight at the bar around 1:15 a.m. when Araim left, got a handgun out of his truck, returned and shot Ricks, leaving him with numerous injuries, severe pain to this day and several more procedures to come, according to his attorney, Tim Williams.

Araim surrendered to authorities three days after a warrant was issued for his arrest. He pleaded guilty in December 2018 to attempted murder and five counts of recklessly endangering another person.

Araim was sentenced to an 80-month prison term, meaning he won't be eligible for release from the Snake River Correctional Institution until 2024.

Along with $6.5 million in economic damages, including medical costs and impairment of earning capacity, the lawsuit seseks non-economic damages from a jury of up to $15 million.

Williams said the two-year statute of limitations for filing such a claim would have run out Wednesday. He said they don't know Araim's current financial status and aren't entitled to learn that until and unless a civil judgment is reached.

""Obviously, if he currently has significant assets, those are collectible, but only if this suit were filed by today,"" Williams said in an email Wednesday.

""Even if Mr. Araim has minimal assets now, if, for example, he were to come into money in the future, Nick’s ability to recover out of those funds would be permanently precluded, had he not filed the lawsuit by today.""

Williams also noted that the bar was not named in the lawsuit because ""we didn't see any liability"" on their part, such as over-serving, ""as (Araim) had only one drink.""

""Nor did he display the firearm long enough to put bar staff on notice that he had retrieved it from his truck prior to shooting Nick in the back several times in quick succession,"" Williams wrote.

""In truth, this was a travesty not only for Mr. Ricks and his family, but also for Crossroads Bar and Grill and their patrons as well,"" the attorney added.", Bring lawsuit against ,3

The bodies of 42-year-old Gary Morris, 33-year-old Nerissa Distin and their 2-year-old daughter Serina Morris were found Wednesday night after their home exploded.

The Columbus Division of Police are now saying the woman and young girl’s deaths are homicides, our media partner 10TV in Columbus reported.

Crews were called around 7:25 p.m. to the home in the 3300 block of Retriever Road. All three were in the same area of the home when it exploded.

Neighbors told 10TV they heard at least two loud booms. Then immediately, flames were pouring from the house.

“When I came out me and my mom saw big old flames and we took off running trying to hurry up. There was nothing we could do,” said Donovan Britford. “It looks like somebody threw a grenade.”

Columbus firefighters were at the home and putting water on the fire within 5 minutes.

With the intensity of the fire, they say it was clear there would be no survivors.

On Thursday, the Columbus Division of Fire said at least one of the deaths was not related to the fire.

A preliminary investigation by police determined the deaths of Destin and Serina to be homicides and the actions of Morris resulted in his own death.

Distin worked as a nurse at Mt. Carmel Rehabilitation Hospital in Westerville. Family members said the couple both immigrated from Jamaica and became U.S. citizens.

Two other children who lived in the home are safe.

Police did not provide any other details and the investigation is ongoing.

23409,3fa5dc6d4106ff3ca7c0b575fdc19243,"Tullow Oil shares plunged on Thursday after the troubled exploration company found less oil than expected after drilling an offshore well in Guyana.

Irish-founded Tullow reported that results from test drilling of its Carapa-1 well off Guyana’s coast showed the oil deposit was smaller than it had hoped, while analysts said that the find was not commercial.

The news wiped more than £60 million sterling (€70 million) off Tullow’s value. The group’s shares tumbled 20 per cent in early trade in London, where it has its main listing, though it recovered to close 6.78 per cent down on the day at 59.66 pence sterling.

Mark MacFarlane, Tullow’s chief operating officer, conceded that the results were below the company’s pre-drill estimates, but he said they proved that an existing lucrative find in Guyanese waters extended to areas covered by its licences.

Job Langbroek, analyst at Davy stockbrokers, noted the reservoir thickness was “sub-optimal and not commercial”. David Round of BMO Capital Market said that the outcome was “some way short” of investors’ expectations ahead of the result.

The poorer than anticipated finding from Carapa-1 follows news that oil production from Tullow’s key fields off Ghana’s coast in west Africa would fall below forecast levels this year.

Chief executive Paul McDade and exploration director Angus McCoss quit last month after Tullow cut production forecasts for a third time. Its shares fell almost 70 per cent in 2019.

Tullow also warned in November that two other discoveries in Guyana contained heavy oil, prompting fears that the projects would be difficult to commercialise.

Liabilities

BMO Capital Markets noted that Carapa-1 had been seen as the “big Hail Mary play” to save the Tullow story after it downgraded its predictions for Ghana.

Tullow said that the well’s net pay – the thickness of the actual oil deposit – was four metres. The company will plug and abandon the well. It will carry out a detailed laboratory of analysis of the oil found, which it said was of reasonable quality.

The Carapa-1 well falls within the Kanuku block off the coast of Guyana in South America, which is 37.5 per cent owned by Tullow. A further 37.5 per cent stake is held by the operator, Spain’s Repsol, and France’s Total owns the remaining 25 per cent.

Tullow suspended its dividend in December and pledged to take steps to cut its liabilities. The company expected net debt to be $2.82 billion by the end of 2019.

Tullow expects total oil production this year to be between 70,000 and 80,000 barrels a day, down from original forecasts of 87,000.

It estimates that production for the next three years would average 70,000 barrels a day from an original prediction of 100,000. – Additional reporting The Financial Times Limited 2020"," Threaten, not specified below",3
23486,d464d3473a8ab3bcdabbd24f8655f963,"The mother of the young woman from Britain found guilty of lying about being raped by 12 Israelis last summer, reiterated her call on Thursday to holidaymakers to boycott Cyprus, arguing it is not a safe destination.

The woman told BBC radio she supported calls on social media for British holidaymakers to avoid the island.

“My personal view is that’s a good thing to do,” the young woman’s mother said.

“The place isn’t safe – it is absolutely not safe. And if you go and report something that’s happened to you, you’re either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what’s happened to my daughter may happen.”

Immediately after the Paralimni district court announced last Monday it found the 19-year-old British woman guilty of public mischief for lying about being gang raped by 12 Israeli tourists in Ayia Napa in July, a campaign was launched on social media with the #BoycottCyprus hashtag and a petition to drop all charges against the young woman.

Sentencing has been set for January 7.

The 19-year-old had been arrested after police said she had withdrawn an accusation that the teenagers had raped her in a hotel room in Ayia Napa. She maintained that she had recanted her accusation only under duress from police, during persistent questioning without a lawyer present. Prosecutors and the court dismissed that justification.

The case has attracted widespread media coverage in Britain, which accounted for a third of the 3.9 million tourists who visited Cyprus in 2018. The woman faces a jail sentence of up to one year.

Her lawyers have said she intends to appeal the verdict.

Meanwhile, a psychologist who assessed the teen said on Thursday morning on British TV she is suffering from “extremely frightening” conditions of PTSD and is in desperate need of treatment. Dr Christine Tizzard told Good Morning Britain that she has been in contact with the 19-year-old woman from Derbyshire.

She said the young woman is likely to be experiencing “hyper arousal, emotional numbing, flashbacks, nightmares and hypersomnia.”

The teen’s mother said on Wednesday her daughter is sleeping 18 to 20 hours a day.

“She needs to get back to the UK to get that treated, that’s my absolute primary focus,” the mother said, adding that she can’t receive treatment in Cyprus because hearing foreign men speaking loudly will trigger an episode.

According to her mother, the young woman is also experiencing hallucinations.

The Cypriot government and the Attorney-general said on Tuesday they were not in favour of intervening in cases heard before the Republic’s courts.

Government Spokesman Kyriacos Koushios said the government has full confidence in the judiciary and the courts of the Republic while Attorney-general Costas Clerides argued that any intervention by him would be an obstacle to the establishment of the facts and intervene in judiciary work.

According to the Independent’s Travel Correspondent Simon Calder the hashtag #BoycottCyprus has been trending and it might affect negatively the decision of British people thinking of travelling to the island given that January is the key month for booking summer holidays.

“The boycott call is likely to have little effect beyond British travellers to the island, but they are by far the most significant contingent,” Calder wrote. In 2019, more than 1.3 million British holidaymakers travelled to the island while in August, one in three visitors was from the UK.

So far there has been no reaction from the tourism industry in Cyprus, with an official of the Cypriot deputy ministry for tourism on Thursday referring to the statement earlier in the week by the government spokesman on the matter.

The Indian subcontinent had been ruled for thousands of years by kings (rajas and nawabs)—who ruled in the name of gods—whereas the common people were their subjects (prajas). Under the British, the common people, from being subjects, were made into slaves. In 1947, when we became independent, the common people had the chance of becoming citizens, but unfortunately we remained subjects. Only our rulers changed.In India, the relationship between the government and the governed is not one among equals. We stand up from our seats when any government official enters the room, as though they are our superiors, when we should not be standing up even if the Prime Minister enters the room. Governance is, in reality, a social contract between equals, wherein the citizens pay the government money through taxes, and the government is supposed to provide certain services in return. This is pretty much like how we pay our telephone company for the services it provides.Although I do not see governance becoming a social contract between equals in the near future, I do believe that it is a concept that will gain ground. This change can happen only through an enlightened citizenry—comprising people who are educated, and wise—which in turn can happen through the elimination of disparities and inequalities within society.When India had grafted the first-past-the-post system into our electoral setup, our leaders did not realise that we are not a homogenous country, such as the US or the UK, from where we had adopted the polling system. We are not homogenous because of our languages, our histories, incomes, apparels, food, education and income levels. When we became independent, our leaders acquired a huge land mass with a population of great pluralities. Keeping this in mind, we should have had a welfare state that would cater to the different segments of people, who had different means.Today our government hospitals are in very bad shape, they are very unhygienic, and are full of poor and low-income people. This is because they cannot afford to pay for healthcare in better, and far more expensive, private hospitals. If you look at public transport outside of cities such as Mumbai and Delhi, in places such as UP and Bihar, for instance, you will see they are only meant to transport human bodies from one place to another. There is no thought given to comfort or convenience.Where public education is concerned, it was either a major act of negligence or a deliberate attempt to perpetuate status quo by Jawaharlal Nehru, when he continued with the system established by Thomas Macauley: On the one hand were the state-sponsored government schools, and on the other were English-medium elite schools. It is the nature of ruling classes that they don’t want to empower the rest of the people through education. Nehru could have done away with this division of class, but he didn’t remove the existing disparities.These three sectors—health, transport and education—are the three equalisers in a society. It is by investing in public health and hospitals, by upgrading and empowering public transport systems, and by investing in education that the government can create an evolved citizenry, who will not look upon the government as their rulers, but as equals. I believe these issues will find increasing space in public discussion and discourse, and in the media over the next decade.What will also play a significant role in the politics of the next decade is mental health. When we look around ourselves, at the faces of those who are 18 or 20 years old, do we find them to be happy? Today’s socio-political atmosphere is giving rise to a lot of uncertainties about the future. The media, too, is a major culprit; it is really not the media’s job to create a state of mind of discouragement and disillusionment.We need to be joyous people. Look at Bhutan, which has a Gross National Happiness Index. We don’t need to be clinical about it—and monitor it like an ECG—but it is something we should be conscious about and work towards. As people we have become very judgmental: We are constantly judging people by what they wear, what they eat, what they think, and what they say.I believe that in the first few years of the next decade, this uncertainty and unhappiness will continue, but from the second half, things will start improving. Youths, in their 20s today, will be in their 30s by that time—they will be the ones running companies and governments—and they will find ways to be a happier lot.Starting with the 2012 protests in the wake of the Delhi gang rape, we have seen the spontaneous gathering and uprising of young people in the past decade. The youth have demonstrated that when there are issues that rattle them, they will come out on to the streets on their own. This is what we are seeing now again, in the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens. The current issues are not about any religion, it is about citizenship and about being Indian. The nature of people at the grassroots who are involved in politics has improved immensely; they are far more aware and participatory than before.But while this has happened at one level, the politicians who are involved in government are akin to a council of regional chieftains. National polity today includes a vast number of sons and daughters of political leaders, who will merely continue with their dynastic and regional power centres. At different levels of elected positions, there are the children of (to name a few): Rajiv Gandhi (Rahul Gandhi), Tarun Gogoi (Gaurav Gogoi), Rajesh Pilot (Sachin Pilot), Madhav Rao Scindia (Jyotiraditya Scindia), Murli Deora (Milind Deora), Sunil Dutt (Priya Dutt), Madhav Singh Solanki (Bharatsinh Solanki), Bhupender Hooda (Deepender Singh Hooda), Mulayam Singh Yadav (Akhilesh Yadav), Lalu Prasad Yadav (Tejaswi Yadav), Farooq Abdullah (Omar Abdullah), Karunanidhi (MK Stalin, Kanimozhi), Vijayaraje Scindia (Vasundhara Raje, Yashodhara Raje), Sanjay Gandhi (Varun Gandhi), Vasundhara Raje (Dushyant Singh), Pramod Mahajan (Poonam Mahajan), Gopinath Munde (Pankaja Munde).In the coming decade, I foresee initial years of dissent, then a cleansing of bigotry, economic reconstruction, the beginning of the end of demagogy, and serious and sombre application of mind by the generation next to ours on an original political ideology for India.(As told to Jasodhara Banerjee)", Sexually assault,3

Key Highlights The PFI claims it’s a social-political organisation involved in fighting for the rights and empowerment of minority sections of society including Muslims

However, the group has been under the scanner of the authorities in various states, especially Kerala

The National Investigation Agency has labelled the PFI a threat to national security

The Uttar Pradesh administration has approached the Union Home Ministry, seeking a ban on the radical Islamic outfit Popular Front of India (PFI). The state’s police believe that the group was behind the recent violent protests in various parts of Uttar Pradesh against the Citizenship Amendment Act that left around 20 people dead.

The Uttar Pradesh head of the PFI and 16 other activists have been arrested for allegedly plotting the anti-CAA flare-up in Lucknow.

“We have written to the Union Home Ministry, recommending that the PFI should be banned,” Uttar Pradesh DGP OP Singh told reporters.

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has said that the PFI should be seen as an “incarnation” of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).

SIMI is banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for its propagation of jihad.

Maurya claimed that the PFI’s role in vandalism in Uttar Pradesh had been established. “Such organisations will not be allowed to grow,” he said. “If needed, they will be banned.”

Lucknow SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said Wasim, Nadeem and Ashfaq of the PFI had been arrested for their role in the violence in the state capital. “While Wasim is the state head, Ashfaq is the treasurer and Nadeem is a member of the PFI,” he told the media, as reported by news agency PTI.

While it needs to be seen if and when the central government bans the PFI, let’s take a closer look at this controversial Kerala-based organisation.

What is the PFI?

The PFI was established in 2006 as a successor to the National Development Fund (NDF).

The NDF, which was formed in 1993 in Kerala’s northern Muslim-dominated belt, took up other avatars in southern India such as the Manitha Neethi Pasarai in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka Forum for Dignity in Karnataka.

Thus, the PFI had a multi-state presence from its inception, though most of its activities are centred in Kerala.

The PFI claims it’s a social-political organisation involved in fighting for the rights and empowerment of minority sections of society including Muslims.

However, the group has been under the scanner of the authorities in various states, especially Kerala. In a series of searches on the PFI’s premises, conducted by the Kerala police between 2010 and 2013, arm and ammunition including crude bombs and jihadist propaganda material from terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda were recovered.

The PFI has also been accused of trying to radicalise a section of Kerala’s Muslim youth.

The National Investigation Agency has labelled the PFI a threat to national security. In January 2018, the ministry of home affairs was reportedly mulling banning the organisation.

The PFI has been named in a number of cases, including for chopping off the hand of a professor in Idukki, Kerala; and the killing of an RSS activist in Bengaluru. A number of PFI members have been awarded prison terms.

The Jharkhand government banned PFI in February 2019 for its alleged anti-national activities and links with terrorist organisations like the ISIS.

The Social Democratic Party of India, widely regarded as a political front of the PFI, is also under the scanner of the Uttar Pradesh police."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
23772,1bf36be29b56e96bc435d17e6956d5a8,"It is time to reevaluate our relationship with the Iraqi government while supporting the Iraqi people.The Iraqi people are protesting a government they view as beholden to Tehran. The events of the last week have proven that true.On December 27, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force Maj.-Gen. Qasem Soleimani tested a red line in Iraq, a red line communicated to Tehran that implied – short of killing an American – there would be no US military response. That night, a terrorist organization created, trained and funded by Soleimani and commanded by trusted Soleimani lieutenant Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes launched a 30-rocket salvo at an Iraqi airbase, an Iraqi airbase where Americans, at the invitation of Baghdad, advise and assist Iraqi security forces in their fight against ISIS remnants.The rocket attack was one of many recent attacks on US bases across Iraq. The difference? This night, Hezbollah killed an American, wounded four American service members and several Iraqi security forces.After a slew of rocket attacks on Baghdad International Airport, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a warning to Iran on December 13th.“We have told the Islamic Republic of Iran that using a proxy force to attack an American interest will not prevent us from responding against the prime actor,” Pompeo told CNN in an interview with Elise Labott. “We will not let Iran get away with using a proxy force to attack an American interest. Iran will be held accountable for those incidents.”Both Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper also communicated to Baghdad that it had a role to play in curbing the activities of Soleimani’s militias, and if not, then the US would take actions against them.After the December 27 Hezbollah attack, the US took action. On December 13, Pompeo warned the Islamic Republic that it would be held responsible for any attacks against American interests. On December 27, Hezbollah killed an American. On December 29, the US Responded.The US hit five bases along the Iraqi-Syrian border. Of all the places to hit, these were the ones that hurt Soleimani and Hezbollah the most. They are the bases built to support Iran’s land bridge and offensive operations in Syria against Israel.Instead of condemning Hezbollah for launching rocket attacks on an Iraqi base against a joint force of Americans and Iraqi security forces, on December 30, the government of Iraq condemned the United States for defending itself against a terrorist organization that answers to Soleimani, and one that Baghdad is powerless to control or to which it is simply beholden.Iraqis call Mohandes “the defacto prime minister of Iraq.” On December 31, he walked into the Green Zone unopposed and attacked the US Embassy with his militia and several others that fall under his control. Baghdad did nothing to stop him.MOHANDES IS the commander of Hezbollah – a designated terrorist group responsible for killing Americans – and the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Units. He is also a leading figure in a grouping of political parties beholden to Tehran. The leaders of the party with the largest voting bloc in the Council of Representatives organized, led and attended the violent protests and attacks on the US Embassy.Leaders of the Badr Corps, Asaib Ahl al-Haqq and Hezbollah stood proud in the crowd along with Falah al-Fayyad, Iraq’s national security adviser and Popular Mobilization Forces official. This is essentially Iran’s ruling party in Iraq. The grouping forms the Bina Party, which decides who runs Iraq.These were not anti-Iran protesters turned anti-American. These are the very militias that are killing Iraqis in Tahrir Square; the very same Iraqis that are protesting against Iran and Iran’s influence on this government; the Iraqis who were killed by Soleimani’s militias while the Iraqi Security Forces did nothing to protect them; the same protesters trying to cross the bridge and enter the Green Zone – not to protest America – but to protest outside the Iranian Embassy in the Green Zone.Let’s call it like it is. The US hit a designated terrorist group: Hezbollah. A group the government of Iraq is terrified of. The current government of Iraq and Iraqi security forces are incapable of dealing with Soleimani’s militias. The US had no choice but to take action.Now Soleimani and his Iraqi counterparts will move the Council of Representatives to expel the USBaghdad has not shown the capability or willingness to secure its borders and territory from malign actors who continue to destabilize the country and the region. Iraq’s lack of unity will continue to incubate internal and external existential threats that the US and the international community will have to deal with.We should listen to the Iraqi people opposed to this government, and Iran’s control of it, and stay. Disfavor Baghdad to favor Iraqis. Stay like we are in Syria – to ensure the continued defeat of ISIS and disrupt IRGC-Quds Force operations.There will be more attacks, and the US needs to be prepared to punish Iran directly by hitting the IRGC and its Quds Force. The US has moved in additional forces for force protection – they are not there to defend against ISIS – they are to defend against militias directed by Tehran that have primacy over Iraqi sovereignty.The US needs to tell Baghdad that all loan guarantees for the $30 billion for “reconstruction” – money that will fall into the hands of corrupt officials tied to Iran – will end if Baghdad continues to bow to Iran.The US needs to sanction and designate Hadi al-Amiri and Falah al-Fayyad for their role in the attack on the US Embassy and the killing of innocent unarmed Iraqis.Pompeo took the first step by calling Al-Amiri an Iranian proxy.More important, it’s time to target “dust off” the target packets against Soleimani and Mohandes – they are enemies of Iraq, the region and the United States.The writer is a former intelligence officer who served in Iraq from 2005-2010 and who works on Iranian sponsored terrorism.

Eastern Black Rhino named Fausta, who is believed to be the oldest of her kind in the world, took her last breath on December 27, 2019, back in Tanzania.

As reported by Fox News, the 57-year-old rhino passed away due to natural causes in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority.

Fausta lived a free moving life for over 54 years before being taken to a sanctuary due to the health problems that she was suffering from.

In a Facebook post, Dr. Freddy Manongi from Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority said that Fausta was first spotted in 1965, when she was only 3 or 4 years old. Her health began deteriorating in 2016 and she lost sight, which made it difficult for her to survive in the wild.

It was observed that Fausta survived 57 years without bearing any calves.

According to World Wildlife Fund, black rhinos are critically endangered. Though the black rhino population was at its historic low 20 years ago, now the numbers have increased to nearly 5,455 rhinos, most of which are located in Namibia.

The number of black rhinos in the world are slowly increasing but the species is still at risk as poachers illegally traffick rhino horns, further endagering the species.

The woman was set afire by five men, including two of her alleged rapists, on December 5 morning when she was going to Rae Bareli to attend a court hearing in the rape case filed by her.

In her statement to Sub Divisional Magistrate Dayashankar Pathak, the woman had said she was attacked when she reached Gaura turn near her home on her way to the court.

She had specifically named Harishankar Trivedi, Ram Kishore Trivedi, Umesh Bajpai, Shivam Trivedi and Shubham Trivedi as the persons who set her on fire.

The woman had also alleged that Shivam and Shubham Trivedi had abducted and raped her in December 2018.", Sexually assault,3

Two Belgian soldiers currently serving in Mali were injured when their vehicle drove over a makeshift explosive, Belgium’s defence minister said.

Both soldiers were hospitalised in Gao a town near the border with Nigeria, located some 1,000 kilometres east of Bamako, and their condition has reportedly become stable.

The incident took place on Wednesday at around 10:00 AM, Foreign Affairs and Defence Minister Philippe Goffin said on Twitter.

A statement shared by Goffin said that an improvised explosive device (IED) had exploded when the army men’s vehicle had driven over it, and that a third soldier had also been taken to the hospital for a checkup.

“With the investigation ongoing, no further information will be given on the subject,” the statement read.

“Trying first day of the year for our soldiers in Mali,” Interim Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès said. “With the Ministry of Defence, we are closely following the situation.”

The injured men were part of a contingent of 90 Belgian soldiers deployed to Mali as part of the United Nations MINUSMA mission, which aims to stabilise the region following an insurgent movement for independence in 2012.

Additionally, ten Belgian soldiers are also currently deployed in Mali as part of an EU-led training mission for the Malian army.

“In 2015, a number of senior Israeli military intelligence officers asked me for information on Daesh activities in Syria and Iraq,” Tzur Shezaf said in an article on Ynet News. “I told them [Israeli officers] at the time that Daesh was a futile threat, and was not posing a major threat to Israel,” Shezaf noted.

He went on to warn Israeli officials of what he described as a “real threat to Israel and its interests,” pointing to Turkey.

“Turkey has become the strongest army among NATO countries and the second in the European continent after the Russian army,” Shezaf continued.

“The Turkish influence has become significant in Libya for years, especially over the last few months.”

READ: What are the consequences of Turkish boots on the ground in Libya?

“The ongoing Libyan conflict is not only over gas and oil resources, but also to control regional waters, because Libya is located opposite Turkey, and the Turks believe that the Israeli-Egyptian-Greek-Cypriot gas pipelines penetrate their territorial waters,” Shezan explained.

“With all the regional conflicts taking place across the Middle East, Israel has to strengthen its naval weapon, with its primary mission to protect its territorial waters, making use of its alliance with Egypt, Greece and Cyprus,” the Israeli columnist concluded.

On 27 November, Ankara and Libya’s UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) signed two separate pacts: one on military cooperation and the other on maritime boundaries of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean.

24145,698b711aa5b9fbd745a27b740e81dc8b,"Fear of losing their job, constant sense of obligation, or the lure of earning a few extra pennies is leading to overseas students in Leeds putting their Tier 4 visas at risk.

“It’s easy money here. My mum is a PhD and she is working as the head of a department at a college in India. I have realised that if I work overtime, I can reach her salary,” says Abhimanyu Chopra, 24, pursuing a master’s degree in Leeds.

Students on Tier 4 have a work prohibition that is expressed in terms of hours. The Home Office only allows international students to work a maximum of 20 hours during term-time.

Flouting these conditions by working too many hours or taking on jobs with an undeclared income can lead to visas being revoked, deportation, or even a ban on entering the country again.

With such serious consequences lingering over an international student’s head, why are so many willing to play dice with their education for a side hustle?

“I think it’s about the availability of opportunities and how vulnerable we are,” says Chopra, who has spent four years in Leeds, undertaking several part-time jobs, however resisting working extra hours.

He added: “I have had friends who have had five simultaneous jobs, working hours more than what the Tier 4 visa permitted them. It left them with just two hours of sleep in a day.

“They earned 25 lakhs [£27,000] in a span of six months. They went to an extent where they got caught and were in detention.”

For students who strive to balance their social, educational and personal needs, the appeal of extra pounds is strong; and employers use this to their advantage and grant them a greater number of work hours than is permitted.

To stay off the radar of the immigration authorities, they sometimes even pay the students in cash.

Emilia Ida, a 23-year-old exchange student from Germany, studying in Leeds, was paid in cash in her previous job and was made to work extra hours.

“Most of these casual jobs pay in cash. Now, I’m only paid on my bank account because the restaurant is owned by a big corporation and nothing can be off the books so easily,” she said.

Ida has taken up several part-time jobs in Leeds during the course of her study and she is of the opinion that students, irrespective of their nationality, are ill-treated at their workplace.

She said: “My manager is a student and is forced to work around 25 hours because. Some employers don’t have manners and I would say that is true for my workplace.

“We’re all studying to be managers, teachers, doctors, I think we have something to us. But because we're earning minimum wage, we're being talked down upon, treated a bit like halfwits and no matter how much motivation and self-drive we started with it's all gone by now.”

In the 2017-18 academic year, there were 468,385 international students studying higher education in the UK. England alone attracted 377,140 international students.

University of Leeds and Leeds Beckett University, the two major universities in the city, this year have 9,000 and 2,000 students respectively.

While there’s no doubt that students forsake the comfort of their homes to take on educational pursuits abroad for better employment opportunities and the flamboyance of a foreign country, budgetary pressures leave students vulnerable to violating laws.

A survey revealed that the average living costs for a student in the UK are about £806.62 each month. This is slightly higher for international students who spend approximately £816 a month. Two-thirds of students cover their expenses with part-time jobs.

Krupa Rao, 24, a former master’s student in Leeds, has had at least seven to eight part-time jobs during her stay in the UK.

She says that while the majority of international students take on additional work to boost their income, utilise time productively and pay off rents, sometimes it’s all about making more money to party.

While Rao didn’t flout the laws, there are plenty students who have. Students are only able to avail this risky route because there’s an option for it. There are many businesses and employers who provide students with the option of working more hours than allowed by the law.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Leeds-based retailer admitted that it has, in the past, allowed international students to flout Tier 4 visa regulations by paying them cash-in-hand. Paying these students less than the national minimum wage.

The manager said: “Students are in need of cash and they often come with the hope that they can make quick money when they don’t have classes.

“They are all from different countries and have education loans to pay off. Some even work for a couple of weeks, make money for immediate needs and then don’t come back.

Clare Newton, student immigration advice and compliance officer at Leeds Beckett University, warned students against working any job that exploits the law.

She said: “Depending on what it states on the Biometric Residence Permit, up to 20 hours per week is what an international student is allowed to work. “If the Home Office finds that they are working more than that it can result in visas being withheld.

“It can also result in a civil penalty. It can have an implication on their immigration status. It’s really not worth risking.”

Whether it is a cynical means of making more money or a desperate cry to cover student expenses, stringent regulation of an overseas student’s life has created a marketplace for exploitation.

The rules, where a simple majority can make or break decisions, could throw a curveball into the looming procedural fights that will determine what the trial looks like.

A handful of senators in both parties will be under the microscope during the proceeding as the press — and leadership — look for areas where members might break ranks.

McConnell (R-Ky.), who is up for reelection in 2020, has tied himself closely to Trump as he plots the GOP strategy and has pledged “total coordination” with the White House — a promise that earned him bipartisan flack.

He’s also been able to exert influence on the White House, winning over officials to his view for a shorter impeachment trial with few, if any, witnesses. He’ll need 51 of his 53 members to successfully muscle through his vision.

Alexander, an ally to McConnell, has emerged as a senator to watch as the chamber crafts the rules of the impeachment trial.

The Tennessee Republican’s decision to retire at the end of 2020 coupled with splits from Trump on high-profile votes, including opposing the emergency declaration on the border wall, have sparked speculation that he could be willing to break rank and support calling witnesses.

Alexander, viewed as a bipartisan dealmaker, has been tight lipped except to say that he hopes McConell and Schumer can get a deal and that he wants it to be a “fair trial.”

Susan Collins

Collins is viewed as a crucial Republican swing vote on both procedure and convicting or acquitting Trump on the two articles of impeachment.

She also knocked both McConnell and Democrats for taking a position on the outcome of the trial, saying that it was ""inappropriate ... for senators on either side of the aisle to prejudge the evidence before they have heard what is presented to us.”

Doug Jones

Jones is viewed as a potential swing vote in the Democratic caucus because of the Alabama senator’s status as the most vulnerable Senate incumbent on the ballot next year.

Jones has called for a “a full, fair, and complete trial” including additional witnesses and documents. But he’s stopped short of saying how he will vote at the end of the Senate proceeding.

The Alaska senator, who once lost a primary and saw her party battle to unseat her in a general election, has declined to tip her hand on impeachment beyond urging McConnell and Schumer to get a deal on the trial proceedings.

She captured headlines over the recess when she told an Alaska TV station that she was “disturbed” by McConnell’s pledge to coordinate with the White House on impeachment.

But she was also critical of the House process, arguing that if House Democrats wanted to hear from Mulvaney and Bolton, who both defied subpoenas to appear, “then that next step is to go to the courts.” House Democrats warned at the time that the White House could drag out the court battle for months.

But, like Collins and Murkowski, the Utah Republican been tight-lipped and pledged to keep a “completely open mind” during the Senate trial.

He’s also sidestepped saying if he wants to hear from specific witnesses or if he would support Schumer’s request for live testimony. He told reporters before the break that he was ""indifferent"" about whether the Senate passes one resolution governing both process and witnesses or handles them in separate resolutions.

Kyrsten Sinema

Sinema (D-Ariz.), who joined the Senate in 2019, has largely managed to avoid the national spotlight as Washington tries to game out the impeachment trial.

But the freshman senator quickly emerged as one of the Democratic caucus’s most moderate votes, including voting with Trump nearly 53 percent of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight. That puts her behind only Manchin among sitting Democratic senators when it comes to voting with Trump.

Sinema is known around the Capitol for being tight-lipped and does not do hallway interviews. But she has indicated that she has not made a decision on final votes, telling KNXV, a TV station in Arizona, that she will go into the trial unbiased.

Sir Keir Starmer is the clear front-runner for the Labour leadership contest, according to a new poll - despite not having declared whether he will stand.

By Gina Davidson Thursday, 2nd January 2020, 10:39 am

A poll suggests the majority of Labour party members want Keir Starmer to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader.

A YouGov survey of Labour members in today's Guardian puts the party's shadow Brexit secretary in the lead on 61 per cent beating Jeremy Corbyn's ally Rebecca Long Bailey, who has said she is considering a leadership bid, who scored just 39 per cent.

The election process will be launched next week, with the new leader taking over in March following Labour's worst election performance since 1935, under Jeremy Corbyn.

The third most popular choice among those surveyed was outspoken Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips, who has also not said whether she will stand.

Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, who jointly ran the poll with the University of Sussex, told The Guardian: ""This is not shaping up to be a 2015-style Labour leadership contest.

""Unless potential candidates drop out before the start of voting, it may take a few rounds to decide the winner this time around. But it doesn't look at the moment as if the winner will come from the left of the party. Right now anyway, Keir Starmer looks to be heading for a fairly emphatic victory.""

At present only shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow treasury minister, Clive Lewis, have formally announced they will stand for the party leadership. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy and party chairman Ian Lavery, are also believed to be considering entering the contest.

Today on the BBC, former Chancellor Ed Balls, refused to confirm or deny whether his wife, Commons Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper, would stand. She lost to Corbyn in the 2015 leadership race.

The poll of 1059 Labour party members put Sir Keir on 31 per cent for first choice votes, while 20 per cent backed Ms Long Bailey, Ms Phillips received 11 per cent, and Mr Lewis and Ms Cooper were the first choice for seven per cent. Ms Thornberry was on six per cent and Ms Nandy was backed by five per cent as first choice.

With less popular candidates eliminated, a final run-off would see Sir Keir beat Ms Long Bailey in the last round, 61 per cent to 39 per cent, according to the survey.

Brexit could have an impact on the result as Ms Long Bailey is rated first choice by 19 per cent of Labour members who voted Remain, but scores 31 per cent of those who voted Leave.Sir Keir is backed as first choice by 34 per cent of Remainers in the survey, but only supported by 17 per cent of Leavers.

Yesterday leadership contender Clive Lewis issued a plea for unity in the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn and said the party faces an ""existential crisis"".

The shadow treasury minister said when you were ""on a cliff-edge"" it was better to work with the people ""dangling with you"", rather than attack them. His comments came in Twitter remarks after media outlets contacted him for his views on party chairman Ian Lavery's analysis of why Labour lost so heavily.

Mr Lavery has said Labour lost the general election because of its ""Brexit position, infighting, a collapse of industry in our communities and a lack of trust in our ability to deliver.""

But Norwich South MP Mr Lewis tweeted: ""Whilst I don't agree with everything he's said I do agree with parts of his analysis.

""So perhaps if all we use the coming (Labour leadership) elections as a lens through which to listen to each other, we can work out a path ahead. Because Ian Lavery is correct to say we face an existential crisis as a party.

Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, yesterday took to Facebook to accuse Prime Minister Boris Johnson of being a ""vicious populist imitator"" of US President Donald Trump.

She stated: ""I hope in November, our long global nightmare will be over and Donald Trump will be dumped out of office by the American people, and we will finally see the United States resume its role as a global leader on the issues that matter to us all."," Accuse of crime, corruption",3

Johnson’s electoral triumph proved that politicians who refuse to reckon with the desires of the voters will be crushed even by those who pretend to do so.

NRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE S ix months ago, the British Conservative party was planning its own funeral; Nigel Farage had embarked on a sold-out tour of its strongholds, helping to cut its vote share to 8.8 percent in the European Parliament elections. Today, the Tories look to be in the prime of their youth. Boris Johnson has taken them to their fourth straight general-election win, the first time in British history that a governing party has increased its share of the vote in four consecutive elections. They now have a mandate for five years of majority government — and, judging by Johnson’s recent pronouncements, he thinks that they’ll have at least five more after that.

A great deal of thought has already been dedicated to figuring out just how the Tories did it. The consensus is that a fusion of Brexit fatigue, Jeremy Corbyn’s ineptitude, and Johnson’s pagan pizzazz won the day. But the forces underlying these contingencies have implications for politics worldwide. They point to a political realignment that could dominate western democracies for years to come.

The 2016 Brexit vote revealed that a large portion of the British population was unrepresented in Westminster party politics, and its aftermath exposed the fact that a large number of politicians would stop at nothing to keep that group unrepresented. To be sure, these MPs would not have put it in such words — they thought that attempting to stop Brexit for three years was acting in their constituents’ best interests. But constituents express their beliefs at the ballot box, and most of them simply did not think that their representatives knew what was best better than they did.

There is plenty to criticize about Johnson and the government that he will now lead, but the same accusation cannot be leveled against them. Johnson ducks scrutiny, avoids substance, and can often seem entirely devoid of empathy. His campaign consisted of the three words “Get Brexit Done,” spun around like a broken play toy. But these words had more power than Labour’s message of social justice, just as the Brexit slogan “Take Back Control” held more sway than the countless predictions that Brexit would bring about economic doom in the run up to the referendum. Both phrases were fashioned by Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s infamous chief adviser, and their success point to a very simple fact: Voters believe in democracy, and they do not take nicely to politicians who don’t. No handout can compensate for the snobbery of those offering it, because voters disdain moral superiority more than they appreciate moral purity.

The roots of this tension go back decades, as successive British governments implemented EU treaties and constitutional reforms without democratic assent. In 1992, when the European Economic Community turned into the European Union, John Major’s government refused to offer the public a referendum on the issue. And in 1997, under Tony Blair, monetary policy was placed in the hands of the Bank of England. The same Blair government pushed for executive asymmetrical devolution in Scotland and Wales, without considering its extreme constitutional implications for England’s representation in Westminster. Then came the 2007 EU Lisbon Treaty, a major change to the U.K.’s constitution that Prime Minister Gordon Brown decided he could ratify without asking for voters’ consent. This move effectively rendered any future promise on migration numbers a lie, because the United Kingdom’s borders were made subservient to Eurozone economics. Voters are not stupid: They realize that an open-borders policy raises problems for the welfare state. Ignoring this fact only made room for extremism when the Eurozone’s economy eventually fell into crisis in 2008.

These were the beginnings of a political realignment that has found its voice in liberal democracies across the continent and beyond — a realignment based on the divide between democratic politics and technocratic politics, in which liberals turn to the courts in order to entrench cultural values for which they cannot not secure democratic consent. The Blair years might have seen continuous government, but they also saw a significant drop in voter participation. Labour’s 2001 and 2005 electoral victories saw turnouts of 59.4 percent and 61.4 percent, respectively — some of the highest levels of voter apathy recorded since World War II. This was rule under the primacy of law and economics masked by the pretense of political consent and temporary economic stability. Divides between the electorate and their representatives on questions of immigration, foreign policy, and national identity were buried under a centrist carpet.

Brexit brought the divide into the open, because it gave voters an opportunity to reject the new constitution of a United Kingdom that had been radically transformed since it joined the EU in 1973. An unprecedented number of people did exactly that, and it is no surprise that this vote then took on the political and cultural significance that it did. Politicians across the Commons agreed to let the voters decide, only to explain away the referendum’s result as an aberration of common sense. Such arrogance meant that Brexit became a symbol of the cultural divide between those who had political control and those whose wishes were considered problems to be solved.

Any politician unwilling to reckon with the scale of the referendum was destined to shrivel into electoral insignificance. Corbyn had no easy way out, because Labour was effectively three different constituencies mashed uncomfortably into one party: middle-class Remainer liberals, woke millennial students, and socially conservative workers. These groups hold irreconcilable views on Brexit and stand in different places along the democratic–technocratic divide. It is a split similarly represented by their Westminster MPs, albeit in distinctly different ratios.

When Corbyn tried to win over Brexit voters, he could not deny that he had allowed a majority of his MPs to prevent Brexit’s implementation. And when he tried to win over Remainers, he was forced to face the fact that he had never been a Remainer (not to mention the fact that his anti-Western brand of foreign policy is antithetical to many Remainers’ liberal internationalism). The only group that truly stuck by him were the students, and anyone who knows anything about democracy knows that students don’t win you elections.

It is easier for the Right to turn its back on austerity than it is for these fundamental issues to be reconciled on the left. David Cameron showed no interest in winning over the group of working class, culturally conservative, Eurosceptics alienated by Labour, but Johnson knew that convincing them to vote Tory was the key to electoral success. That simply meant doing everything in his power to distance himself from his party’s previous three governments on the economy and Brexit. He made a series of generous public-spending promises, even going so far as to question his own party’s entire record of austerity. And while Corbyn’s Labour floundered between Brexit policies, the prime minister kicked out the 21 rebel MPs who’d refused to keep open the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal.

It was a radical move, but also a deeply Conservative one. The Tories are the oldest political party in Europe and, by some accounts, the oldest in the world. They co-opt extreme movements, ameliorate them, and incorporate them into their fold; they spend years locked in rampant infighting, only to find a way to work together when election time comes around. This time, they used Brexit to tame a toxic brand of nativism. The two key players, Johnson and Michael Gove, stabbed each other in the back repeatedly before aiming their fire at Corbyn. (Gove twice ran against Johnson for the party’s leadership, but has played a major role in his government.) If the Conservative party really is in its youth, then its lifespan will be something to be behold. But it will not be a surprise that it has managed to adapt, because its adaptability is a mainstay of democratic history.

Adaptability can also be called opportunism, and both words apply to Johnson is in equal measure. He knew that assembling the entirety of the Leave coalition was a path to victory, because the Remain vote would be fractured between parties. He knew that Brexit had become a symbol of the divide between democratic politics and technocratic politics, and that party allegiances were being redefined by a set of politicians whose beliefs had long been at odds with their voters. Johnson’s tactics may well have been cynical, reckless, and divisive — proroguing Parliament is hardly a moderate response to political deadlock. But his claim to be on the side of the people was made convincing by the fact that he was the only potential prime minister promising not to turn his back on a democratic vote. Opportunists wear masks, and often say less than they know. But they aren’t naïve, and Johnson is no exception.

Hence, Johnson and Corbyn can be considered two different kinds of liar. Johnson is untrustworthy, careless, and unprincipled. His lies are half-truths, told with a grin that makes them appear more like chat-up lines. They make some people swoon and some people sick — but they also make almost everyone laugh. Corbyn’s lies do not make people laugh, because they give the impression of someone who is not ready to admit that he is lying. In this election, confronted with a parliamentary-party split on Brexit and an electorate that did not trust him on national security, Corbyn’s ultimate lie was to pretend that he could conduct his form of politics while staying honest. Asked about his position on Brexit, his party’s record of anti-Semitism, and his view on the Russian-poisoning scandal, Corbyn simply equivocated, and pivoted to talk about suffering children.

Nobody ever doubted that Corbyn cares for suffering children, of course. People doubt that he is capable of recognizing that holding political office requires more than caring. He is all passion and no realism, a man of conviction rather than responsibility. Politics is an art of power-plays that often involves difficult choices, not a competition of sincere passions and honest intentions. While Johnson lies for the sake of politics, Corbyn lies about politics, and voters know it. Johnson may be playing a game, aware that he needs power in order to leave behind a legacy. But democracy will always choose a bluffer over a hedger. While Johnson told a series of little lies, Corbyn told a big lie: He pretended that the electorate cared more about his priorities than its own.

Johnson now has five years to make this electoral shift permanent, to convince workers in the North who lent him their vote that they made a wise decision. This means focusing on the so-called “people’s priorities” — another campaign phrase directly lifted from the final line of one of Cummings’ blog posts. He must secure the trade deals necessary to offset Britain’s exit from the Eurozone, address regional inequality, get tough on crime, invest in the NHS, crack down on terrorism, and somehow do all of it without alienating wealthier voters in the Southeast.

It remains to be seen how long jail sentences for whistleblowers will be paired with a massive green-energy R&D budget, or whether control of borders is more important to voters than cutting the number of people crossing them (Johnson is adopting an Australian-style points system, but shows no signs of capping immigration). Brexit will have negative economic consequences, and the government will have to borrow its way through them. Its coalition is made up of groups that will shrink with time — older, whiter, and less qualified than tomorrow’s population.

But perhaps the greatest question mark is whether the Tories can hold the U.K. together along the way. Johnson’s victory was primarily an English victory. His Brexit deal effectively means that Northern Ireland will stay part of the single market, making the case for unification with Ireland proper more credible. Meanwhile, the Scottish National party’s dominance in Scotland puts the union under further threat from the North; SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has already demanded another independence referendum.

But ironically, a divided Britain is likely to hurt Labour more than the Conservatives. After it was wiped out in Scotland in 2015, Labour effectively lost any path to an electoral majority — and an independent Scotland would only cement its political impotence. Though many in the party are justified in considering how it can reclaim the working-class constituencies with which it fell out of touch, perhaps a better approach would be to double down on its success in big cities. Deserting its historic base and teaming up with the Liberal Democrats for the college-educated vote may help the party in the long term, but would also turn it into an entirely different organization (and could lead it to a similar fate as the French Socialists). The triumph of Conservative adaptability has often been aided by the failure of the Tories’ opponents to adapt, and the Tories’ current opponents have a difficult task ahead of them.

In 2015, Cameron was hailed as a magician for leading the Tories to a meager twelve-seat majority, and an era of coalitions and minority governments was expected to rule Britain for decades. In 2020, Johnson has a stronger mandate for reform than almost any other leader of a liberal-democratic country on Earth. The EU will have no choice but to negotiate with his team: Brussels faces enough problems of its own and will not want to be blamed for creating another. And if Johnson can temper threats to the union while Labour continues its infighting, he will be practically beyond parliamentary scrutiny.

None of this is to say that Johnson will have it easy. He will likely soon face the difficulties that such power brings: Party conflict, economic downturns, and geopolitical crises. But this election was a sign that politicians who have refused to reckon with the beliefs of their voters will be crushed even by those who have pretended to do so. In other countries, the catalyst for this realization may not be Brexit. Indeed, Brexit may have forced a conversation to take place in Britain that many liberal democracies cannot yet bring themselves to have."," Threaten, not specified below",3

24416,caa1e7ef353c03db9d7e8c7b57e8c856,"Melbourne, Jan 2 (PTI) Australian authorities on Thursday declared a state of emergency and forced evacuation of residents, tourists and closure of roads in the bushfire zones in the states of New South Wales and Victoria ahead of Saturday's forecast of 'horrible' fire conditions due to the intensified heat wave.

Catastrophic blazes ripped through the country's south-east on New Year's eve, killing at least eight people and stranding holidaymakers.

New South Wales government on Thursday declared state of emergency for a week starting Friday which would mean forced evacuations and road closures for people in bushfire zones ahead of Saturday's forecast 'horrible' fire conditions.

Authorities have urged people to leave the impacted areas if they can as the Rural Fire Service department is expecting tough conditions over the weekend.

'So we're going to have a very long, difficult day of hot, dry winds, dominating out of the north, north-west before a southerly change emits. It is going to be a very dangerous day. It's going to be a very difficult day,'' Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said.

As of Thursday, NSW was struggling with 113 fires burning across the state with over four million hectares burnt.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian thanked the police for their efforts to ensure people's safety.

'I want to thank in particular police, fire rescue personnel who have made sure that where people can have access to main roads, that they can let them through even monitoring them closely, with only letting a few cars through at a time,' he said.

'We know temperatures will be in the mid-40s in parts of the state. We also know that there are a lot of tourists on the move and allowing us to declare the state of emergency from tomorrow morning will allow us to ensure that we can provide safe access to roads when we need to,' he said.

'We can also provide safe access to roads when we need to, we can also provide safe access to and from destinations as we have been encouraging people to move back home, to travel safely ahead of what will been very difficult circumstances on Saturday,' Berejiklian added.

Berejiklian urged people to exercise caution.

''We encourage people to exercise caution. We do appreciate that for some, it is difficult to access supplies but it's much easier than what it was yesterday and the day before,' he said.

As the catastrophic blaze intensified, Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday said Australia's existing emissions reduction policies will do enough to protect the environment and seek to reduce bushfire risks.

Morrison said the National Security Committee of the Cabinet would meet on Monday to consider bringing in more Defence Force ships and helicopters 'as well as the longer-term response and some issues we have identified to consider amongst premiers after the fires'.

'Our emissions reductions policies will both protect our environment and seek to reduce the risk and hazard we are seeing today. At the same time, it will seek to make sure the viability of people's jobs and livelihoods,' he said during a press conference.

In the state of Victoria, authorities on Thursday urged people in the East Gippsland region to leave the bushfire zones, especially in the state's north-east and large areas of the High Country, with conditions expected to worsen on the coming weekend.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed Navy vessels will also commence the evacuations efforts in the region of Mallacoota on Friday early morning.

One man was confirmed dead and there are ''grave concerns' regarding 17 people who are still missing in Victoria while in NSW, seven people were confirmed dead.

Victoria's Deputy Emergency Commissioner Deb Abbott said people living in alpine areas of the state as well as East Gippsland and the Upper Murray region had a 24-hour window of opportunity to leave, or risk being cut off by smoke and flames.

'We want them to leave now,' she said.

'We don't want those people to become isolated like some of the communities down at East Gippsland, so again I ask; leave now,” she said.

'Leave zones” are also in place for the NSW south coast, from Nowra in the north to the Victorian border.

The Rural Fire Service has now issued tourist 'leave zone' declarations for four areas: Snowy Monaro, Shoalhaven, Batlow/Wodalga and the south coast.

''Fire dangers on Saturday will reach severe to extreme, yet again, across fire sites and communities that have already seen wide-scale devastation,' Bureau of Meteorology's Jonathan How said. PTI NC RUP RUP RUP"," Threaten, not specified below",3
24451,810ed1b220435dbb68df69a632941911,"Dear Mick: You state, regarding the Fatty Arbuckle alleged rape-murder incident, “That crime never happened.” However, since you were not there, you can’t truthfully say it “never happened.” The first two trials ended in hung juries, indicating that the evidence was not open and shut.

John Schuck, Palo Alto

Dear John: No, it was open and shut. It never happened. Here’s the story: Virginia Rappe was part of a small group of people that were hanging out in Arbuckle’s room in San Francisco’s St. Francis Hotel, drinking. She drank too much and tried to go to the bedroom that had the nearest bathroom, but her friend Maude Delmont was in there having sex with the actor-director Lowell Sherman. So Rappe went into Arbuckle’s room to throw up. A little while later, Arbuckle went into his room and saw her on the floor of the bathroom. He carried her to the bed and went back into the bathroom, shaved, took a shower and got dressed — all this took 10 minutes.

When he came back out, he thought she didn’t look right, so he called a hotel doctor, who examined Rappe, and said she’d drunk too much. Rappe went home. Arbuckle went back to Hollywood and thought nothing of it. And four days later, Rappe died of a perforated bladder.

Delmont, who had a record for both blackmail and extortion, told the police that Arbuckle had raped Virginia Rappe — that she’d heard her screams. She was two hotel rooms away. The people outside Arbuckle’s room had heard no screaming. Medical tests revealed Rappe had not been violated — had not had any sex at all. She also had venereal disease, which Arbuckle did not contract. After she went home, Rappe checked into a maternity hospital, and after her death, the maternity hospital removed all her reproductive organs and disposed of them, before letting the coroner do an autopsy. The best guess is that the maternity hospital either performed a botched abortion on Rappe or that they tried to assist her after she did one on herself. But clearly, they were covering up something.

Arbuckle was tried and convicted in the press, which repeated insane rumors, some of which unfortunately persist to this day. Delmont, the only so-called witness, was so unreliable that she wasn’t even called to testify. The only reason it went to court is that the district attorney, Matthew Brady, wanted to score points by going after Hollywood, a perennial easy target for moralizing phonies. The first jury hung because one of the jurors, a friend of Brady’s, refused to acquit Arbuckle. The second hung because the defense attorneys, naively figuring that Arbuckle’s previous testimony was good enough, didn’t put him on the stand. Finally, the third jury acquitted him in five minutes and crafted an apology that began: “Acquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle. A grave injustice has been done.” He was a completely innocent man, but his life, career and reputation were destroyed. Forever.

Dear Mick: I’m 72 and grew up with “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.” It never occurred to me that the man wanted her to have sex or spend the night. I’ve never even been sure that Rick and Ilsa ever had sex.

Janice Wood, San Francisco

Dear Janice: I can’t be sure about Rick and Ilsa (“Casablanca”), either. Normally, I’d hope they did, but in one way I hope they didn’t, for her sake. That soggy lower lip, the constant smoking. … It’s bad enough she had to kiss that guy.

Dear Mick: I’ve always thought that the film “JFK” was one of the finest ever made. Did I miss the bus on this one?

Robert Freud Bastin, Petaluma

Dear Robert: No, it’s one of the great films of the 1990s. I’ve watched it about a half dozen times — always the 206-minute director’s cut. I don’t mess around. The problem is that Lee Harvey Oswald has somehow come back in style. People actually want to believe he did it.

24909,8d744ad50b49602a3fb53007c09709b1,"Books of Ernest Hemingway are a matter of taste. Some love them, some – not so much. But despite all, there’s a lot you can learn from Ernest Hemingway. In this article, there are tips from the writer that can help to improve your writing as well, even if your writing is code.

Hemingway says: Study The Greats

Before even starting programming, you should be curious about others who have already written some great code. Hemingway said: “[A writer] should have read everything so that he knows what he has to beat.” It doesn’t have to be all about competition. It’s more about the inspiration you can get from different approaches to writing code.

To study great examples of code, you don’t need to go under the hood of various projects. Many books analyze the best examples and tell stories about how people came up with them. Arnas Stuopelis, Chairman of the Board of web hosting provider Hostinger, says: “One of the Hostinger values is Learn & Be Curious . We have a bookshelf in the middle of our office and suggest people ordering any book they want. It doesn’t always have to be work-related. But if it motivates a person, it’s a valuable investment.”

Hemingway says: Block Out Negative Thoughts

Randall Degges has a blog “ Random Thoughts of a Happy Programmer “. In it, he writes: “If you’re a programmer and stay up-to-date with community happenings via Hacker News , you’ll almost certainly notice a trend: there are lots of popular articles focusing on the negatives (mean rants, public shaming, outrage about various issues, etc.).” All those little details lead to feeling blue.

It can be intimidating to work on a project when you are in a negative state of mind. Then remember the Hemingway. He said: “Once you are into the novel, it is as cowardly to worry about whether you can go on to the next day as to worry about having to go into inevitable action. You have to go on. So there is no sense to worry… As soon as you start to think about it stop it. Think about something else.” Questioning your abilities won’t do any good. Be easy on yourself, remain consistent, and continue what you started.

Hemingway says: Be Brief

Hemingway didn’t respect writers who, as he put it, “never learned how to say no to a typewriter.” But the same goes for a keyboard. When you can write part of the code more shortly, do that. There are no advantages to having more lines. It’s the opposite – the more lines you have, the bigger the chance to make a mistake in one of them. So remember to be brief.

Hemingway says: Practice Empathy

Hemingway advises: ”As a writer, you should not judge. You should understand… Listen now. When people talk listen completely. Don’t be thinking what you’re going to say. Most people never listen.” As for developers, it’s quite stereotypical to see them as someone who is only logical and numbers-based.

But the truth is that the developer has to be empathetic first. Kent Beck , the American software engineer and the creator of extreme programming, says: “The craft of programming begins with empathy, not formatting or languages or tools or algorithms or data structures.” When writing code, remember that you do it for people.

Hemingway says: Always Stop When You’re Going Good

This one is probably the most known Hemingway’s tip: “The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day when you are writing a novel, you will never be stuck.” But it works not only with novels. BBC summarizes it this way: “not finishing a task can be beneficial.”

BBC quotes Manalo, who researched this topic: “We need to have belief in ourselves – some kind of expectation that we can do something. And when we’re closer to finishing something that we had previously failed to achieve, then that optimism increases.” When you stop working at a peak, you will feel more comfortable to get back to work the other day.

Hemingway says: Never Think About The Story When You’re Not Working

It isn’t easy to not think about work when you are not working. But it’s crucial. Hemingway wasn’t any different. So, he had to create a distraction for himself: “It was necessary to read in order not to think or worry about your work until you could do it again.”

As for developers, Joe Petrakovich suggests a more suitable way to disconnect from work. He calls it Personal Standup . He creates a todo.md markdown file and writes his tasks for ## TODAY. Joe suggests: “As you work, be sure to mark items as DONE. Don’t delete them though. They stay as visual aids, so we know what we’ve accomplished.” If he hasn’t done the task by the evening, he moves it to ## TOMORROW, so ## TODAY would be all done. The list of done tasks makes it easier to wrap up the day and don’t bring work home.

Hemingway says: Exercise

As a writer, Hemingway used to be at the typewriter for extended periods of time. So he said: “It was necessary to get exercise, to be tired in the body, and it was very good to make love with whom you loved. That was better than anything.” There is a good chance that you, like Hemingway, spend quite a lot of time sitting, but this time, in front of your keyboard.

Sitting for long periods of time has a significant effect on posture. A person starts to extend a neck, brings face closer to the keyboard. Then hunches shoulders forward and slumps in the chair. Simple Programmer warns: “When we sit down, certain parts of our bodies shut down. Our muscular and cellular systems were put to sleep, causing our chances of things like diabetes to increase.“ Regular exercise can help to avoid all of that and more.

As a programmer, you can seek inspiration from various places and people. Ernest Hemingway sat in front of his typewriter. But his tips are usable even for those in front of the keyboards.

To get even better at programming, you should learn from the best and study their work. Believe in your capability and ignore negative thoughts. When writing code, be brief and learn how to say no to the keyboard. Be empathetic and try to understand the people who will use your work.

When working, try to stop at the time you feel the best. This way, it will be easier to get back to work the next day. But once you are done with this day, do your best to rest without thinking about what’s left to do. And one way that can help to do that is exercise, which is beneficial for you on many levels."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

The Constitutional Court has concluded that the right to life of a patient was violated as her death was caused by medical negligence and lack of postoperative medical services at the Cebeci Hospital of Ankara University.

Diagnosed with cancer, Yaşar Gündüz lost her life after having a surgery at the hospital. Her son lawyer Murat Kemal Gündüz appealed to the administrative court and filed a lawsuit into her passing. As the lawsuit was rejected and the verdict of rejection was upheld by the Court of Cassation, Gündüz appealed to the Constitutional Court.

Speaking to bianet about the issue, lawyer Gündüz has indicated that her mother was not only diagnosed with cancer, but she also had a kidney disease. The hospital did not have even an intensive care unit, according to Gündüz. ""We were also surprised when we heard that the hospital where she was operated on did not have postoperative service or a nephrology department"", Gündüz has told bianet.

'Court did not investigate allegations of negligence'

In his appeal to the Constitutional Court, Murat Kemal Gündüz indicated that ""his mother was not provided with sufficient medical treatment, they could not reach the attending physician, their requests for referral from the hospital without an intensive care unit or nephrology department to more fully-fledged hospital with an intensive care unit were not fulfilled for days although her condition deteriorated and this delay in referral caused her death.""

Announcing its justified ruling, the Constitutional Court has concluded that the administrative court rejected the lawsuit solely based on a report issued by the Forensic Medicine Institute.

The supreme court has also indicated that the administrative court did not investigate the allegations that ""the physician who did the surgery could not be reached for four-five days, the patient was treated by not attending doctors, but by practicing physicians, the hospital did not have a nephrology clinic or a dialysis machine, therefore, the hospital was insufficient for treatment and there was a delay in referral despite this insufficiency.""

""That the court did an inspection to detect the physicians who took part in the treatment of Yaşar Gündüz cannot be detected, either"", the Constitutional Court has added further.

Underlining the condition of urgency and diligence in conducting penal investigations into the right to life and right to protection of material and nonmaterial assets as well as in pursuing lawsuits for damages in judicial and administrative justice, the Constitutional Court has ruled that the right to life has been violated on procedural grounds.

With the right to life guaranteed by the Article 17 of the Constitution violated, the file will be referred to the Ankara 3rd Administrative Court so that the consequences of the violation can be eliminated in retrial.

What happened?

Diagnosed with cancer, 78-year-old Yaşar Gündüz underwent a surgery at the Cebeci Hospital of Ankara University Medical School on January 27, 2010. She lost her life two days later.

Her relatives appealed to the Ankara University Presidency, requesting that the material and nonmaterial damages caused by her death be compensated. As their requests were rejected, they filed a lawsuit for damages at the Ankara 3rd Administrative Court.

'Distant diagnosis with consultation on phone'

In the petition submitted to the court, it was indicated that Yaşar Gündüz ""lost her life as a result of severe neglect of duty caused by a failure to provide her with the necessary care and treatment services during and after the surgery.""

The petition also claimed that ""though an attending physician was called from the pulmonology department, no physicians showed up and as her condition deteriorated, they tried to have a diagnosis by consulting pulmonology and nephrology doctors from other buildings by phone.""

'The only treatment was hitting her in the back'

Not treated at the hospital, the patient was abandoned to her fate, according to the petition of her relatives:

""While all these were happening, an attending physician equipped with necessary medical expertise could not be found and she was left to incompetent practicing physicians. The patient was abandoned to her faith and she was not diagnosed all through the weekend. The only method of treatment was to hit her in the back because there was edema in her lungs.""

The petition also indicated that the referral of the patient to another hospital was requested, but these requests were not fulfilled. Only when the patient passed out, she was referred to İbni Sina Hospital, where she lost her life, according to the petition of the relatives.

Court gave a ruling based on Forensic Medical report

The 1st Specialized Board of Forensic Medicine Institute issued a report on the patient, indicating that she died as a result of complications caused by the tumor, the follow-up and treatment before and after the surgery were in compliance with medical rules and there was no negligence that could be attributed to the administration or healthcare professionals.

Relying on this report and conducting no further investigation int o the allegations of negligence, the Administrative Court rejected the lawsuit. As the verdict of rejection was upheld by the 15th Chamber of the Court of Cassation on March 24, 2014, the relatives of Yaşar Gündüz made an individual application to the Constitutional Court.

VICTOR, N.Y. (AP) — The top Republican in the New York State Assembly was charged New Year's Eve with driving while intoxicated in his state-issued vehicle, just a week after he wrote a newspaper column warning citizens against getting behind the wheel drunk.

Brian M. Kolb, a Republican from Canandaigua who represents a district just outside Rochester, was arrested near his home after what he called a “lapse in judgement.""

Authorities said they were called to a crash in Victor just before 10:30 p.m. after a vehicle ran into a ditch. Kolb was found to be the driver of the 2018 GMC Acadia that crashed in front of his home.

An Ontario County sheriff's deputy administered field sobriety tests, which Kolb failed, before taking him to jail.

While there, authorities said a breath test indicated Kolb's blood-alcohol content was over 0.08%, which is the legal limit for driving in New York.

No one else was injured. Officials did not say where Kolb was driving from.

Kolb said there was no excuse.

“This was a terrible lapse in judgment, one I have urged others not to make, and I take full responsibility for it,"" the assemblyman said in a brief written statement. “I made the wrong decision, and it is one I deeply regret.""

Kolb has represented the district since 2000 and has served as Assembly minority leader since 2009. The district covers all of Ontario County and a portion of Seneca County. In 2018, Kolb briefly campaigned to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo before dropping out of the race.

On Christmas Eve, Kolb wrote a column in the upstate Daily Messenger newspaper that warned against driving while under the influence of alcohol during the holidays, and acknowledged December is National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month.

“Many of our holiday traditions, especially our New Year’s Eve celebrations, involve indulging in spirits,"" he wrote. “Done safely, and in moderation, these can be wonderful holiday experiences. However, tragedy can be only one bad decision away.""

News of Kolb's arrest led fellow Republican Assemblyman Kieran Michael Lalor to call for him to step down.

Kolb “should step down as Assembly Minority Leader,"" Lalor tweeted. “That he hasn’t done so already is a disgrace.""

But Assembly Deputy Minority Leader William Barclay, also a Republican, said it's ""premature"" to ask for Kolb's resignation. Barclay said lawmakers will be back in Albany next week, and said Kolb should have a chance to speak before lawmakers decide how to move forward.

“I've talked to a lot of members,"" he said. “I think there are people who are concerned."""," Threaten, not specified below",3

It may not have been paradise, and it may not have been paved over for a parking lot, but last month’s demolition of the old Tower Records building stung Sacramento historians and nostalgists alike. “It’s always a mystery when an owner fails to understand the intrinsic value of these irreplaceable assets,” Gretchen Steinberg, president of Sacramento Modern, an architectural preservation nonprofit, wrote in an email to SN&R. “You can’t fake history—no amount of brick veneer (or slick marketing/new neighborhood nickname campaign) is going to bring that mojo back once it’s been removed or knocked down.” The circa-1927 building at 2500 16th Street was technically the second storefront that late Tower Records founder Russ Solomon opened in the mid-1960s, part of a Sac-grown retail empire that would mostly thrive over the next four decades. Tower Records filed for bankruptcy and the record store closed in 2006, after which Dimple Records took the space, until its own going-out-of-business woes forced it to close up shop in September. Two months later, the old, mural-caked building fell. But was it historic? On that point, the building’s owner and local preservationists disagree. Defining ‘historical’ Local preservationists call the building’s destruction a loss for the Broadway corridor, as well as a warning sign for other neighborhood landmarks. “Longtime Sacramentans know that these buildings had a very significant place in their hearts and minds, and were an integral part of the neighborhood’s and community’s collective memory,” Steinberg wrote. But property owner Jon Gianulias has a much different view, calling the 1920s era structure “not historical.” The city’s preservation director, Carson Anderson, cast the deciding vote whether the building could and should be left standing. While sympathetic to those who believe that it should, Anderson determined that the former storefront was neither architecturally nor culturally significant enough to be protected as a city landmark, thus paving the way for demolition. Anderson explained that the building lost most of its architectural noteworthiness due to various remodels over the years. To him, the iconic Tower Theatre across the street and Tower Records’ former location at 726 K Street—also featuring a mural commissioned by Solomon—are more central to the company’s history. “In my judgment, those two buildings are more compelling in telling the story of Tower Records than a building that was not the first location and underwent several design modifications over the years,” Anderson said. Solomon began selling records out of his father’s pharmacy in the theater building in 1941. He opened his first freestanding records store on Watt Avenue in December 1960. The franchise expanded to San Francisco in the late ’60s and Los Angeles in the early ’70s before going worldwide with hundreds of stores. The visionary entrepreneur passed away in March 2018 at the age of 92 following an apparent heart attack. Russ Solomon, founder of Tower Records, died in 2018.

A changing Broadway Preservation supporters point to other old buildings with local history that were preserved in some fashion as part of redevelopment projects. They say the Hardin mixed-use apartment complex on K Street and the upscale Carlaw apartments on R Street, both of which incorporated existing infrastructure, are examples of what could’ve been done to Tower Records’ former home and a neighboring building at 1600 Broadway, which is also slated for demolition. But Gianulias argues that repurposing the former Tower storefront and the connecting building that he owns was unrealistic. “They had been [run] into by cars and were not reinforced and fell to ground very easily,” he said. “Surprised they lasted that long, given unreinforced brick.” Still, advocates were caught off guard by the sudden disappearance of a building so synonymous with one of Sacramento’s most recognizable brands. After receiving a demolition permit on Dec. 6, Gianulias moved forward with the demolition days later despite advice from Anderson to first reach out to neighborhood residents and preservationist groups. Some folks, such as New Helvetia Brewing owner David Gull, were able to salvage some mural paint-spattered bricks, but only after many had already been torn down and hauled away. “It’s a tough balance,” Gull said. “I own and operate a business on a corridor that probably needs a little more help. And truthfully, more housing would be useful. But we also still need to try and respect the legacy of what’s lost when new things come into place.” Gianulias is aiming to profit off the Broadway corridor’s renaissance with a new project. A development plan is about six months out, he said. In recent years, the corridor has seen a bevy of new developments, such as the Mill on Broadway. Boosters see the area as the next to grow into an entertainment and nightlife draw, after R Street with its restaurants, bars and concert venue. Others, however, worry that Broadway may be losing its distinctiveness. New incentives to save old buildings Even as development interest creeps south from downtown and Midtown, Joan Borucki, executive director of the Greater Broadway District, said she’s trying to maintain the corridor’s melting pot vibe. “Broadway used to be a busy commercial hub,” she said. “And then it became just a corridor for commuters to get either from Interstate 5 or Highway 99. So we’re trying to bring back that Main Street vibe, but we don’t want to lose the eclectic diversity that goes on there.” Two blocks from the demolition site is a two-story brick building built in 1925 that houses New Helvetia Brewing Co. A little further east down Broadway sits Pancake Circus in a Googie-style building designed in the early 1960s by renowned Sacramento mid-century modern architect Sooky Lee. Both of these buildings, among others in the area, are potentially in jeopardy without the proper protections in other parts of the city, says William Burg, president of Preservation Sacramento. Despite its original brick facades, art deco architecture and plentiful neon signage, Broadway lacks a historical district status, which provides legal teeth for preservation efforts. Burg said the city conducted surveys in the early 2000s for a potential historic district, but stopped there. The Tower buildings weren’t part of the survey at the time, he noted. Designating buildings as historic makes it easier for developers to pencil out redevelopment projects, Burg said. He touted the state’s Mills Act and its newly approved historic rehab tax credit as remedies to the high costs associated with rehabilitation projects. Enacted in 1972, the Mills Act grants cities and counties the authority to provide tax relief to owners of historic buildings who actively participate in the restoration and maintenance of their properties. Sacramento adopted its Mills Act program in August 2018. The city has since entered into contracts with 10 historic property owners. The fate of the former Tower Records store could galvanize future preservation efforts, Burg suggested. “There are still a lot of potentially eligible historic resources on Broadway, and sometimes a demolition like this is a wake-up call,” he said.

The Indonesian cement industry has called on the government for a moratorium on issuing construction permits for new cement plants for the next five years as the local market has an excess of 25Mta of capacity.



As reported in the local press, Widodo Santoso, chairman of the Indonesia Cement Association (ASI) said: ""This is a warning to the government, and here it refers to the Investment Co-ordination Agency (BKPM). Until 2024, it's best that no new construction permit will be issued for new cement plants.""

Syrian government artillery fire killed nine people, including five children, in opposition-held Idlib province on Wednesday, first responders say.

Sixteen others were injured when cluster munitions hit a school in Sarmin which was sheltering displaced people, according to the White Helmets.

It came as pro-government forces continued an offensive to the south.

Idlib is the last major region still held by rebel fighters and jihadists opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.

The United Nations says the hostilities are having devastating consequences for the three million people living there, of whom 76% are women and children.

A ceasefire halted a government assault on Idlib in August that had reportedly left more than 1,000 people dead and displaced an estimated 400,000 others.

However, skirmishes and bombardments continued and on 19 December fighting resumed along the frontlines in the south of the province.

The school in Sarmin hit on Wednesday was run by the UK-based humanitarian organisation Syria Relief, which said two of the children who died were six years old. The others were nine, 11 and 13, it added.

Another 12 children were among the injured, as were two teachers, one of whom had to have a leg amputated.

Syria Relief said six of its schools had been damaged by military action since April, and that Wednesday's attack meant another 913 children were out of education.

""Unfortunately, our hopes for 2020 to be the year when the suffering of the Syrian people stops feels like they have already been dashed,"" said Charles Lawley, the organisation's head of advocacy.

Some 284,000 people have fled their homes, mostly in southern Idlib, as a result of the hostilities since 1 December, according to the UN.

The major town of Maarat al-Numan and its surrounding countryside, 30km (19 miles) south of Sarmin, are reportedly almost empty, while people from Saraqeb, only 9km from Sarmin, are fleeing in anticipation of the fighting reaching their area.

Most of the displaced are heading north to the city of Idlib, where public buildings like schools are being used to house them, and to camps near the Turkish border.

Ethiopia made Foreign Policy’s list of “10 Conflicts to Watch in 2020,” which predicts, “Elections scheduled for May 2020 could be violent and divisive.” Swelling tension and internal conflict in the nation threaten to thrust Ethiopia into turmoil, possibly even collapse. This will present radical Islam with an opportunity to hijack the political unrest and increase its control over the Horn of Africa.

Ethiopia is Africa’s second-most populous nation, and it is also one of the most divided. The nation’s 105 million people belong to more than 80 different ethnic groups and speak several different languages. The nation is partitioned according to major ethnicities into nine separate regions. Each of these regions has its own executive, judicial and legislative branches; its own regional flag; is governed by its own constitution; and in many cases, has its own language.

Much of the nation’s ideologies, policies, programs and projects are issued by the central government. This undermines the federation’s principle of regional self-rule and causes much of the anti-government hatred across the regions.

Our list of 10 conflicts to Watch in 2020:



1 - Afghanistan

2 - Yemen

3 - Ethiopia

4 - Burkina Faso

5 - Libya

6 - The US, Iran, Israel and the Gulf

7 - U.S.-North Korea

8 - Kashmir

Protests in Oromeia, Ethiopia’s most populous region, against the ruling regime in 2016 brought the current leader, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, into office in 2018. Abiy’s rule initially brought relative peace. He was even awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize in October for settling Ethiopia’s dispute with its Eritrean neighbors.

However, grievances and small-scale conflicts are simmering underneath Ethiopia’s facade of relative stability.

Leading up to the May 2020 elections, the nation is divided between two groups: pan-Ethiopian nationalists, who favor a stronger central government, and ethnic nationalists, who favor the independence of the individual states.

But it’s not quite that simple.

Within the ethnic nationalists favoring state independence, the states fight and bicker among themselves as they strive for supremacy in the next government. According to a report by the Institute for Security Studies, these internal conflicts, which often become violent, have given “rise to a more hardened nationalist rhetoric, resulting in even more (intense) conflicts.”

The current ruling coalition, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, is led primarily by Abiy and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, a political party dominated by the Tigrayan region. Therefore, any national decree issued by the central government favors Tigray over other regions. This means that national policy is created by and favors 6 percent of the population, causing frustration in the other 94 percent.

The ethnic strife between the nine regions has led to hundreds being killed and, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Global Report on Internal Displacement, almost 2.9 million people being displaced in 2018, the highest number of displacements from a conflict that year worldwide.

New Opposition

According to Africa News, prominent Ethiopian activist Jawar Mohammed is set to join the Oromo Federalist Congress opposition party to participate in next year’s national elections.

“Jawar Mohammed and his media network is a powerful force in this region,” said Clionadh Raleigh, a professor of political geography and conflict at the University of Sussex. “I think that Jawar Mohammed has incredible power and that power is not something that Abiy yields.”

Mohammed was instrumental in the 2016 protests that ultimately brought Abiy to power. He used social media to organize strikes and protests that led to the toppling of the government. Blogger Hailu said that “his greatest influence is on the Oromo youth,” claiming that he can “create resistance among the youth.”

In November, the Oromia region, including Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, became the stage of several anti-Abiy rallies and clashes between ethnic groups. Deutsche Welle reported, “The violence came after a Facebook post in which Mohammed accused Abiy’s security forces of trying to orchestrate an attack on him in the region.” Video footage posted on social media showed hundreds of young Oromo men joining the gathering outside Mohammed’s home, chanting slogans such as “Stand down Abiy,” according to Al Jazeera.

Ethiopia is a very young country—43 percent of the population is under age 15. Just under two thirds of the nation is younger than age 25. This is why Mohammed’s popularity with the nation’s youth gives him so much power.

Christian-Muslim Conflict

Oftentimes these political divides are more than just ethnic; they are also religious. Ethiopia is a majority Christian nation with a large Muslim minority, at about 34 percent, according to data by cia World Factbook.

In Ethiopia, religion is a big deal. According to a 2018 Pew Poll, 98 percent of polled Ethiopians say that religion is very important in their lives.

The Oromeia region is equally split between Christians and Muslims, with a slight Christian majority. Here, more than anywhere in Ethiopia, the religious divide is most evident. When protests ignited in 2016, the large majority of conflicts occurred throughout Oromeia between Christians and Muslims.

Far from resolved, Ethiopia’s Christian-Muslim divide is an ongoing issue.

On December 24, Al Jazeera reported that several thousand Muslims across Ethiopia protested the burning of four mosques in the Christian-dominated Amhara region. In Amhara, thousands are protesting the ill treatment of Christian students in Oromeia.

The widespread conflicts and internal division have made Ethiopia prone to intense, sporadic violence. The unrest is expected to worsen leading up to the May 2020 election as ethnic and religious conflict takes center stage.

The central government is weak and the nation’s politics are becoming more and more volatile. As a result, Ethiopia is in danger of collapse.

The Prophecy

In Libya and Ethiopia in Prophecy (first published in 2012), Watch Jerusalem editor in chief Gerald Flurry writes, “What is the immediate future of Libya and Ethiopia? We must go to the Bible for the answer—you will find it no place else.” These two nations are mentioned together in a prophecy in Daniel 11: “And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over. … But he [the king of the north] shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, … and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps” (verses 40, 43).

These scriptures prophesy about the rise of radical Islamic group of nations in the time just before the coming of the Messiah. This end-time power, biblically called the king of the south, will be led by Iran. (For proof, request a free copy of The King of the South, by Gerald Flurry.)

The Soncino commentary defines “at his steps” as either “joining his army or placing themselves at his beck and call.” The Gesenius’ Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon defines the expression as “in his company.”

Radical Islam thrives in an environment of civil unrest. When the Egyptian and Libyan governments fell in 2011, radical Islam momentarily gained control of both nations.

If these ethnic and religious conflicts cause the collapse of Ethiopia’s government, the nation, especially the Muslim-dominated regions, will likely fall prey to radical Islam and Iranian control. Considering Ethiopia’s heavily Christian population, many consider this forecast to be far-fetched. Nevertheless, the Bible is clear about what Ethiopia’s fate will be.

Iran has a long history of working in Central and East Africa. In 1993, a few hundred Iranian troops worked in neighboring Sudan. Two years later, thousands of Iranian-educated terrorist trainers were in the country. Though the relationship isn’t as strong as it once was, Iran is still active in the region, supporting various terrorist organizations. It has continued its support for the al-Shabaab terrorist organization in nearby Somalia and the Houthi rebel movement in Yemen.

Mr. Flurry continues in Libya and Ethiopia in Prophecy:

All you need to do is get a good map of the Middle East, with the emphasis on the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Then you can see why the king of the south, or radical Islam, is so interested in an alliance with or control over these two countries (as well as Egypt and Tunisia). They are on the two seas that comprise the most important trade route in the world! Whoever heavily influences or controls Ethiopia will undoubtedly also control the small areas of Eritrea and Djibouti on the Red Sea coastline. These areas only recently became independent of Ethiopia. Also, I believe the Bible view is that these small areas are included as a part of Ethiopia. … So you need to watch Libya and Ethiopia. They are about to fall under the heavy influence or control of Iran, the king of the south.

For years, we have watched for radical Islam to gain control of this majority Christian nation. Since 2011, Mr. Flurry has been warning that this will happen. Now that Ethiopia is in the limelight as one of the top 10 conflicts to watch in 2020, this prediction rings truer than ever.

25413,686ce2e21a2877166cc8fd57d85eb83a,"Climate change activist Greta Thunberg speaks during a Fridays for Future protest in Turin, Italy December 13, 2019.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Europe’s airlines are flying into a carbon cloud. New European Commission boss Ursula von der Leyen’s continental Green New Deal puts the sector firmly in the cross hairs. Her most obvious ammunition is removing the free rides airlines get from fuel tax and emissions credits. A bigger threat to the industry, though, comes from Greta Thunberg.

Airlines currently account for less than 3% of CO2 output globally, but this will climb as air traffic grows and power stations and cars switch to renewables. Unlike other sectors, functional green alternatives like bio-jet fuel or electric planes are years, possibly decades, away. Until then, airline bosses have carbon offsetting – basically paying for projects like tree-planting to suck up CO2 – as their sole defence against regulators and teenage Swedish activists.

Budget carrier easyJet’s pledge to spend 25 million pounds on annual offsets is a case in point. But that’s unlikely to spike von der Leyen’s green guns. Her easiest riposte would be to make airlines pay jet-fuel duty. Assuming regulators used the existing commercial levy, that would add 21 euros to every 1,000 litres of fuel, a roughly 5% increase. Another would be to ditch the free credits airlines get for Europe’s carbon-trading regime. At the current 24.6 euros per tonne of CO2, that’s worth 114 million euros to Ryanair, 12% of 2020 forecast operating profit.

And then there’s Thunberg. In 2019, her flight-shaming movement contributed to a 4% decline in passengers through Sweden’s airports, according to operator Swedavia. Map that across Europe and carriers have a big problem. Assume a 5% jet-fuel duty and no free carbon credits, and easyJet’s 580 million euros of forecast 2020 operating profit drops to 465 million euros. But chuck in a peak-Greta 4% decline in passengers and it nosedives to just 150 million euros. Ryanair’s more than halves to 437 million euros.

And these two are just the tip of the iceberg, carrying only a third of the 700 million intra-Europe flyers in 2018. Extrapolate their combined lost operating profit to the rest of the industry, and that’s a nearly 3 billion euro hit continent-wide. On Ryanair’s 16 times multiple for 2020, it would mean 48 billion euros of market value disappearing into thin air.

Such a perfect storm may not hit, of course, and airlines would doubtless push back. But as evidence of climate change and its cost mounts, the industry looks increasingly exposed.

25526,7424d8da453a35bded6226185fca0d38,"LOOK: Smooth start to the New Year in Durban

Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Share

Durban - The New Year got off to a smooth start along Durban beaches, thanks to an integrated approach by metro police, the SAPS and a number of law-enforcement agencies. While a number of motorists were arrested for drunken driving during a series of roadblocks on New Year’s Eve, and alcohol was confiscated from revellers on the beachfront, metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad believes the cleaning teams were the unsung heroes of the festive season.

Sewpersad said teams were designated to areas along the promenade and were able to ensure that dirt was picked up on time. “They would go out each night, accompanied by metro police officers, and pick up after those who enjoyed themselves at the beach. They would make sure that revellers returned the to a clean beach. We applaud them,” he said.

Msawakhe Mayisela, eThekwini Municipality spokesperson, said they commended the teams for ensuring an incident-free crossover into the New Year. “Our teams deserve a pat on the back. Their work clearly demonstrates that they went all out. We are very grateful for the work that they have done. We are going to keep this momentum into the rest of the year. We also commend our residents for helping, by throwing their dirt in designated bins. It is all of our responsibility to ensure that we manage our litter responsibly,” he said.





Mayisela warned residents, when disposing of their braai debris, to ensure that coal was completely burnt out before they disposed of it in bins.

He said, in the early parts of yesterday morning, rubbish in a Durban Solid Waste truck caught fire, after embers were thrown into the truck when rubbish was collected from the beachfront.

“Luckily no serious damage was done, however the truck had to be emptied on site and the area cleaned up. When disposing of the ashes, wet them and allow them to cool down completely, then contain them in a disposable garbage bag before placing them in metal or concrete bins.”

He cautioned beachgoers to be safe and swim in areas where lifeguards were on duty.

Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Simon Zwane said more than 3000 people had been arrested for drunken driving since the start of December, in roadblocks and traffic operations throughout the province.

Meanwhile, quick response of the eThekwini Inner South Cluster Task Team resulted in the arrest of an 18-year-old teenager after a video of the suspect posing with a firearm went viral on social media.

SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said the teen, who was in illegal possession of a 9mm pistol with ammunition, was arrested at the weekend.

“Preliminary investigations revealed that the firearm was stolen in Phoenix during March 2019,” said Naicker.

The teenager was charged with pointing a firearm and has already appeared in the Wentworth Magistrate’s Court.

The psychologist who developed the Government’s main deradicalisation programme today said it can never be certain that terrorists have been “cured”.

Christopher Dean set up the Healthy Identity Intervention (HII) rehabilitation scheme for prisoners convicted of offences linked to extremism.

It was one of the courses attended by Usman Khan, who stabbed two people to death near London Bridge on 29 November.

Khan was a convicted terrorist who had been a member of an al Qaeda-inspired group that plotted to blow up the London Stock Exchange.

Mr Dean told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that some offenders who take part in his scheme regress afterwards for complex reasons such as who they mix with.

“They may come into contact with individuals or they may go through a spell in life where they may begin to re-engage with groups or causes or ideologies associated with their offending behaviour,” he said.

“I think we have to be very careful about ever saying that somebody no longer presents a risk of committing an offence. I don’t think you can ever be sure. We have to be very careful about saying someone has totally changed or has been cured.”

Khan killed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, during a knife rampage at a prisoner rehabilitation event in Fishmongers’ Hall before being shot dead by police. The 28-year-old had been released from prison on licence in December 2018 when he was reportedly responding to rehabilitation.

Mr Dean said: “The two main aims of healthy identity intervention are primarily to try and make individuals less willing or prepared to commit offences on behalf of a violent extremist group cause or ideology.

“If we can reduce someone’s relationship or identification with a particular group, cause or ideology, that in itself may have an impact on whether they’re willing to offend or not.”

As part of the HII scheme, offenders attend sessions with a psychologist who encourages them to talk about their motivations, beliefs, identity and relationships.

Mr Dean said HII was only one part of attempts to manage such offenders, adding: “I think we need to be careful about suggesting that interventions in themselves are the solution.”

There has been no evaluation of the scheme’s long-term success.

A government spokesman said the new counter-terror Bill will keep terrorists in prison for longer and strengthen licence conditions if they are released.

He added: “We also use a range of deradicalisation programmes for terrorists before and after they are released from custody and use a robust multi-agency approach to monitor extremists released into the community.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

VICTOR, N.Y. (AP) — The top Republican in the New York State Assembly was charged New Year’s Eve with driving while intoxicated in his state-issued vehicle, just a week after he wrote a newspaper column warning citizens against getting behind the wheel drunk.

Brian M. Kolb, a Republican from Canandaigua who represents a district just outside Rochester, was arrested near his home after what he called a “lapse in judgement.”

Authorities said they were called to a crash in Victor just before 10:30 p.m. after a vehicle ran into a ditch. Kolb was found to be the driver of the 2018 GMC Acadia that crashed in front of his home.

An Ontario County sheriff’s deputy administered field sobriety tests, which Kolb failed, before taking him to jail.

While there, authorities said a breath test indicated Kolb’s blood-alcohol content was over 0.08%, which is the legal limit for driving in New York.

No one else was injured. Officials did not say where Kolb was driving from.

Kolb said there was no excuse.

“This was a terrible lapse in judgment, one I have urged others not to make, and I take full responsibility for it,” the assemblyman said in a brief written statement. “I made the wrong decision, and it is one I deeply regret.”

Kolb has represented the district since 2000 and has served as Assembly minority leader since 2009. The district covers all of Ontario County and a portion of Seneca County. In 2018, Kolb briefly campaigned to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo before dropping out of the race.

On Christmas Eve, Kolb wrote a column in the upstate Daily Messenger newspaper that warned against driving while under the influence of alcohol during the holidays, and acknowledged December is National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month.

“Many of our holiday traditions, especially our New Year’s Eve celebrations, involve indulging in spirits,” he wrote. “Done safely, and in moderation, these can be wonderful holiday experiences. However, tragedy can be only one bad decision away.”

News of Kolb’s arrest led fellow Republican Assemblyman Kieran Michael Lalor to call for him to step down.

Kolb “should step down as Assembly Minority Leader,” Lalor tweeted. “That he hasn’t done so already is a disgrace.”

But Assembly Deputy Minority Leader William Barclay, also a Republican, said it’s “premature” to ask for Kolb’s resignation. Barclay said lawmakers will be back in Albany next week, and said Kolb should have a chance to speak before lawmakers decide how to move forward.

25864,ab6d359991f0f750dc0b33a1018537bb,"© Jagyaseni Biswas PM Modi dials all neighbouring countries on New Year except Pakistan

Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the New Year by exchanging greetings with the leaders of all neighbouring countries to maintain healthy diplomatic ties. He made separate phone calls to his counterparts in Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka, but bypassed Pakistan.

This is not the first time PM Modi gave a cold shoulder to Pakistan. Ever since India’s ties with Pakistan began worsening, especially following the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019, the theocratic neighbours have remained missing from the Prime Minister’s list.

The tension between the two countries reached its peak in recent times when Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed attacked Indian military camp in a pre-dawn attack on September 18, 2016 killing 17 Indian Army personnel.

In reply, the Indian Army carried out a pre-emptive strike on terrorist training camps in Pakistan, 11 days after the attack from Jaish-e-Mohammed, killing over 35 terrorists.

Things became worse after 40 CRPF troopers lost their lives in a suicide bomber attack by Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir.

After a brief period of thaw, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan invited the wrath of the ruling party in India once again by openly criticising the decision to strike down Article 370 from the Constitution on August 5 and splitting the state into two union territories.

According to a Mint report, while extending New Year greetings on behalf of all Indians, PM Modi laid extra stress on his commitment towards the ‘neighbours first’ policy, and the willingness to maintain peaceful, cordial ties.

The Prime Minister made sure not to leave out countries such as Sri Lanka and Nepal, where China has made deep inroads already, along with Bhutan, which they are trying to appease at the moment.

A statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office mentioned that Modi highlighted to the King of Bhutan how the two nations have consolidated their special relations over the past year.

Meanwhile, both the President of Sri Lanka and the Prime Minister “expressed confidence that India and Sri Lanka would further enhance their friendly ties in the year 2020”.

Another noteworthy exchange was with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, as relations had soured mildly following the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Act.", Carry out suicide bombing,3

An NHTSA statement said the agency has assigned its special crash investigation team to inspect the car and the crash scene. That team has inspected a total of 13 crashes involving Tesla vehicles that the agency believed were operating on the Autopilot system. Results were published in two of those cases, one of which involved Autopilot. Results are pending in the other 10 cases, the agency said in a statement.

Messages were left Tuesday night seeking comment from Tesla.

Another Tesla crash killed a woman Sunday in Indiana. State police said the driver, Derrick N. Monet, 25, of Prescott Valley, Arizona, was seriously injured after he rear-ended a fire truck parked along Interstate 70 in Putnam County. His wife, Jenna N. Monet, 23, was pronounced dead at a hospital.

Derrick Monet told investigators he regularly uses his Tesla's Autopilot mode, but didn't recall whether he had it activated at the time of the accident, state police Sgt. Matt Ames said.

Earlier this month, a Tesla struck a police cruiser and a disabled vehicle in Connecticut but nobody was seriously hurt. The driver told state police that he was using the Autopilot system and had looked around to check on his dog in the back seat.

Both Tesla and the NHTSA have advised that advanced driver assist systems such as Autopilot aren't entirely autonomous but require human drivers to pay attention at all times. But several crashes --- some fatal --- have been blamed on driver inattention linked to overconfidence in such systems. In one crash report, the National Transportation Safety Board referred to it as ""automation complacency.""

The National Transportation Safety Board has criticized Tesla's Autopilot. In September, that agency said that in a 2018 crash in Culver City where a Tesla hit a fire truck, the design of the Autopilot system ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task."" Nobody was hurt in that accident.

The NTSB determined in September 2017 that design limitations of the Tesla Model S Autopilot played a major role in a May 2016 fatal crash in Florida involving a vehicle operating under Autopilot. But it blamed the crash on an inattentive Tesla driver's over reliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car.

“As we enter 2020, politics is going to be hot, at its peak…but as you decide to support contestants, look out for those who support Buganda issues,” Mr Mayiga told thousands of revellers who came from across 18 counties of Buganda to join Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II as he ushered in the New Year.

Without pointing at a particular candidate, Mr Mayiga said he was confident the subjects know what to do.

He further said the suitable candidates in the 2021 General Election should be those who stand for the kingdom’s five pillars of preserving the kingdom, support federo and abhor sectarianism, protect Buganda’s boundaries/ land, supporting development, and fighting corruption.

25923,70ee8c71d1ab6c8c201762196f9f5265,"ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey’s parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a bill that allows troops to be deployed in Libya, in a move that paves the way for further military cooperation between Ankara and Tripoli but is unlikely to put boots on the ground immediately.

President Tayyip Erdogan said last week Turkey would deploy troops in Libya to support Fayez al-Serraj’s internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).

The GNA last month requested Turkish support as it fends off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar’s forces, which are backed by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan.

Fighting and air strikes continue around Tripoli, where the U.N. refugee agency said three mortars had fallen on Thursday close to an overcrowded transit center housing around 1,000 migrants in the center of the city.

Turkey’s move comes after Ankara and the GNA signed two separate agreements in November: one on security and military cooperation and another on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, infuriating Greece, Israel, Egypt and Cyprus.

Almost immediately after the vote, Egypt strongly condemned the parliament’s decision, and called on the international community to urgently respond to the move.

The bill, opposed by all major opposition parties, passed with a 315-184 vote. Opposition parties said the move may exacerbate conflicts in Libya and endanger Turkish soldiers in the region and Turkey’s national security.

But Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the bill was an important step for protecting Ankara’s interests in North Africa and the Mediterranean, and for achieving peace and stability in Libya.

‘DANGEROUS ESCALATION’

The GNA’s interior minister Fathi Bashagha said Tripoli had requested Turkish support following a “dangerous escalation” in the conflict by Haftar’s forces.

“As Libya’s only legitimate and sovereign government, the GNA is the singular entity with the right to formalize military alliances necessary to safeguard our nation,” Bashagha said, adding that the GNA aimed to stop a “war criminal” from seizing power and establish stability, security and democracy in Libya.

Dmitry Novikov, a Russian lawmaker, said after the vote that a Turkish military presence in Libya would “only deteriorate the situation”, according to the Interfax news agency.

Later on Thursday, Erdogan discussed Libya with U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call, the Turkish presidency said without providing more details. Erdogan is due to discuss Libya with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month.

Ankara has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a U.N. report.

But analysts and some officials say Ankara is unlikely to immediately deploy troops, sending military advisers and equipment first.

“The hope would be that the Turkish military may not itself be involved in military action,” said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who is chairman of the think-tank Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies.

‘DETERRENT’

Last week, a senior Turkish official said Ankara could train Libyan soldiers in Turkey, and Reuters reported that Turkey may also consider sending allied Syrian fighters to Tripoli.

On Wednesday, Vice President Fuat Oktay said the bill served a symbolic role that Ankara hoped would be a “deterrent” to the parties, and that Turkey may not send troops if Haftar’s forces pulled back.

The maritime agreement between Ankara and Tripoli has ended Turkey’s isolation in the eastern Mediterranean, where it is at odds with Greece over resources off Cyprus. Greece has said the accord violates international law, but Ankara rejects this, and says it only wants to protect its rights.

Greece, Cyprus and Israel signed a deal on Thursday to build a 1,900 km (1,180 mile) subsea pipeline to carry natural gas from the eastern Mediterranean to Europe, but analysts say the accord between Turkey and Libya could present a barrier to the plans.

“Ankara sees its involvement in Libya as a symbol of its new status as a regional power,” said Asli Aydintasbas, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Brian M. Kolb, 67, a Republican from Canandaigua who represents a district just outside Rochester, was arrested near his home after he ran his 2018 GMC Acadia into a ditch during what he called a 'lapse in judgement.'

Authorities said they were called to a crash in Victor just before 10.30pm Tuesday and Kolb was found to be the driver of the tax-payer funded car that crashed in front of his home.

When they responded to the 911 call made by a passerby, they could smell alcohol on Kolb.

Images obtained by RochesterFirst.com showed the scene where an Ontario County sheriff's deputy administered field sobriety tests, which Kolb failed, before taking him to jail.

While there, a breath test indicated Kolb's blood-alcohol content was over 0.08%, authorities said. The legal limit for driving in New York is 0.08%.

No one else was injured. Officials did not say where Kolb was driving from.

Kolb's mug shot shows him wearing a gray hooded sweater and sporting stubble facial hair.

Kolb said there was no excuse.

'Last night, I was charged with driving under the influence near my home. This was a terrible lapse in judgment, one I have urged others not to make, and I take full responsibility for it,' Kolb said in a statement on Wednesday.

'I fully recognize the severity of the situation and I am profoundly sorry. There is no excuse and no justification for what occurred Tuesday evening. I made the wrong decision, and it is one I deeply regret.'

Kolb said Wednesday: 'It's a terrible lapse in judgment, one I have urged others not to make, and I take full responsibility for it. I made the wrong decision, and it is one I deeply regret'

District Attorney Jim Ritts said Kolb would not get special treatment because of his job and a special prosecutor. A judge from outside of the county will be assigned Thursday

Kolb has represented the district since 2000 and has served as Assembly minority leader since 2009. The district covers all of Ontario County and a portion of Seneca County. In 2018, Kolb briefly campaigned to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo before dropping out of the race.

On Christmas Eve, Kolb wrote a column in the upstate Daily Messenger newspaper that warned against people driving while under the influence of alcohol during the holidays, and acknowledged December is National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month.

Referencing statistics from the Special Traffic Options Program for Driving While Intoxicated, he told readers that last year alone there were 4,142 arrests for impaired driving and 144,197 tickets and violations issued.

'This year, let’s try to get both of those numbers to zero,' Kolb wrote.

'Many of our holiday traditions, especially our New Year's Eve celebrations, involve indulging in spirits,' he wrote. 'Done safely, and in moderation, these can be wonderful holiday experiences. However, tragedy can be only one bad decision away.'

U.S. airstrikes on the Iran-backed militia in Iraq have roots in Iran

Jan.2,2020 | Hassan Mahmoudi

Posted on by hassan.mahmoud

In early November 2019, a new wave of recent uprisings in Iran -- triggered by high inflation, unemployment, and institutionalized corruption within the regime -- resulted in more than 1500 deaths and 12,000 detainees. These protests were a natural progression from the recent surge of protests in Iraq and Lebanon. Irans stronghold in these countries was shattered and its hope to create a heavily-invested Shiite Crescent had come under attack.

Forty days have passed since the unrest began. The regimes security guards have used threats and arrests to prevent families from holding funeral ceremonies for those killed in the protests. The Iranian regimes brutality and crudeness appalled the world. Last Sunday, the U.S. launched airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia in Iraq. U.S. attacks should be analyzed as one of the dominoes that the Iranian regime is watching fall.

Any U.S. attack should looked at in the larger context of the Iran regimes current situation. Alongside the U.S. attack, the recent surge of uprisings in Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon, send the regime a unified message: Back down a little.

The U.S. airstrikes were a retaliation move, a first in response to Irans continuous ambitions beyond its borders. Since October 28, 2019, Iran-backed militias have made 11 attacks against U.S. military bases that house American diplomats and military personnel. Iranian Revolutionary Guards also fired on an American drone. Up until Sunday, the U.S. opted not to retaliate.

Image Mojahedin.org

Sundays military attack against Kataeb Hezbollah, which killed 25 fighters, was the first American military response of its kind in this regard. Although the U.S. action is framed as retaliation for an American contractors death last week from a Kataeb Hezbollah rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, the real reason for the strike can be found elsewhere.

Why?

The answer lies in the Iranian regimes current status, as well as the geopolitical situation in the Middle East. In 2002, American policy changed generally in the Middle East and, specifically, coalition forces occupied Iraq. These changes gave the Iranian regime a golden position to expand its influence in the region. Iran began to form militia and proxy groups in Lebanon, Iraq and, later, in Syria and Yemen. Irans terrorist expansion in the above countries has proven to be a headache for the U.S.

Irans golden window is drying up, though. The violence it fomented in the last 17 years is creating a backlash. Whats happening now, both the riots and Americas willingness to target Iran-backed militias and threaten major retribution for the embassy raid, suggests that the new golden window of opportunity is not for the Iranian regime, but for the regimes foes.

The situation is still fluid. Its up to the people of this region, including those in Iran, to decide what comes next. Their decisions will form and fuel resistance forces or weaken and destroy them.

On one front, the Iranian regime is facing very serious challenges at home, for it is surrounded by countless political, economic, and social issues. On another front, the Iraqis dismay about Iranian meddling and its growing hatred for the Iranians create similar political challenges and deadlocks in Iraq.

Given that the Iranian regime does not have the power to bring the anti-regime forces in Iraq under its control, the Iraqi unrest is bringing things to a pivotal point. As always, and as a natural consequence of similar situations, Irans inability to act will produce negative outcomes just as a malfunctioning heart will exhibit muscle pains, signaling problems at the source. For a political and geopolitical analogy, one only has to look at the Soviet Unions fall, which was preceded by breakdowns in distant territories over which it lacked full centralized control.

By attacking the U.S. K1 Military base in Iraq, the regime in Tehran intended to have a show of force to inspire its own weak and disengaged proxies. Contrary to its intent, the attack became a biting snake coming after the regime. While this type of proxy attack might once have served the regimes purpose by instilling fear, those days are over, thanks to the recent massive unrest in Iran. For Irans regime, theres no going back. If its citizens no longer fear it, why should people in other countries give it respect. The regime in Tehran is in complete disarray these days.

So, the heroic people of Iran and their resistance are saying farewell to 2019 and optimistically welcome 2020, a year promising to be a year of more bad news for the regime of the mullahs.

Iran is the root of evil in the world and since we were dead set on war in 03, they should have been the target and not Iraq.



To: hassan.mahmoud

Once Trump gets serious, he will call on, publically, for the Russians, Chinese, Syrians and North Koreans to either break with Iran or face the same music. All the crap about the end of year North Korean surprise was centered on the North Korea/Syrian/Iranian nexus for missile and nuclear tech. That Trump dealt with Iran and is facing up to the proxy war and is ready to use USSOCOM to defend foreign service posts worldwide will have a chilling effect. Iran’s window is closing, even for use of terrorist attacks. They pledged since 1979 to attack 1) Diplomatic Missions abroad, 2) American Corporate Interests, 3) American citizens, both foreign service, military and civilians. Trump will both defend US Interests where previous administrations either would not or (could not) - could not because we were bogged down in a GWOT and huge troop deploments to the Mid-East - but now all 30K plus special ops troops can be put to use in stealth defense of our Interests and Diplomatic Corps abroad, and Trump is going to go head to head with the Iranians and their proxies. We control the Sky and as Trump has stated it will be quick and fast with Iran proper - it might take another couple of years to finish off the terror cells but they too will be destroyed or disband globally as funding dries up. The big bonus is that we finally get to take down the rest Al Qaeda in Qoms and other cities in Iran with a regime change there.



To: hassan.mahmoud

Iran is so desperate to troll Trump into making a move that will harm him geopolitically that they are playing weak cards. Any time they cause trouble outside of their borders (and the perception of their sovereignty) such as attacks on oil facilities in S.Arabia or the embassy in Iraq, they show how their patience is eroding. An overreaction on our part, and thus playing into their hands, would be to retaliate inside of Iran. So far, Trump’s play has been very good. Defensive, measured, and commensurate. It seems to me that he is aware of Iran’s intentions. They really want him to stick his neck out there, so the democrats and the media can take a swing at it here. Al Gore is probably the strategic liaison between the DNC and the Ayatollah . heh



To: z3n

Al Gore was supposed to be John Kerry. Sorry, I got previously failed democrat presidential hopefuls crossed up. Iran, like N.Korea, are now in an ‘outlast Trump’ holding pattern. The only problem is that there is every probability that Trump wont lose in November, which is why they need to attack him politically. Rhetoric wont work. They need to make him trip up.



To: hassan.mahmoud

The Iranian people have their opening, let’s hope they take it.

26111,6bb219de889ef04f3ff14fcdf1939f43,"THE mother of a British teenager found guilty of lying about being gang-raped in Cyprus has backed calls for tourists to boycott the country.

The 19-year-old was convicted on Monday of causing public mischief, prompting a #BoycottCyprus hashtag on Twitter.

Her mother told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that she supported the campaign and that she believes the resort of Ayia Napa is dangerous.

‘The place isn’t safe — it is absolutely not safe,’ she said. ‘And if you go and report something that’s happened to you, you’re either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what’s happened to my daughter may happen.’

The teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists, aged between 15 and 20, in a hotel room in Ayia Napa on July 17. But she signed a retraction statement ten days later. She told Famagusta district court, in Paralimni, she was forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police. The Foreign Office has said it was ‘seriously concerned’ about the fairness of her trial and officials are understood to have raised the ‘deeply distressing case’ with Cypriot authorities.

Meanwhile, Cyprus has said it has ‘full confidence’ in its justice system.

Yesterday, the teenager’s mother said her daughter was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder, hallucinations and was sleeping for up to 20 hours a day because of a condition called hypersomnia.

She has been on bail since August after a month behind bars and faces up to a year in jail and a £1,500 fine when sentenced on Tuesday.

‘She needs to get back to the UK to get treated — that’s my absolute primary focus,’ her mother said.

A crowdfunding appeal to raise money for legal support has passed £80,000. The girl’s mother said they would be appealing against the verdict ‘without question’.

Trial judge is blasted over tantrums in court and ‘shameful’ treatment of teen defendant

THE judge at the centre of the gang-rape case has been accused of treating the teenage defendant ‘shamefully’ during her trial.

District judge Michalis Papathanasiou (pictured) is said to have repeatedly lost his temper and shouted: ‘Show respect, face the front and you must respect this court.’

Dr Marios Matsakis, a forensic expert witness who gave evidence, said: ‘He was shouting, he was aggressive. It was shameful -judges like this should go home. It’s embarrassing.’

According to the Daily Mail, the defendant was ordered at least six times to sit down or step outside so the judge could hear separate cases. The judge also rejected bids for her bail conditions to be relaxed, dismissing suggestions she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

He also ‘scolded’ her lawyers Ritsa Pekri and Nicoletta Charalambidou.

“Political and social unrest has brought the country to a standstill,” the report says of Haiti, “driving food prices up by 40 percent.” More than one in three Haitians, or 3.7 million people, needs urgent food assistance, in both rural and urban areas. Among these, 1 million are suffering from severe hunger.

WFP’s 2020 lowdown presses home the need for the world to act swiftly — with billions of dollars in investment — to stop food insecurity deepening its tentacles in vulnerable locations across the world.

Under a sliding scale of ‘Overheating’, ‘Boiling’ and ‘Simmering’, Global Hotspots 2020 explains the factors behind each emergency, its effects on people, and the action WFP is taking to help avert a deepening of the crises.

Another country at highest risk is Zimbabwe, where the worst drought in decades is accompanied by “temperatures hitting 50 degrees Celsius and the water flow at Victoria Falls slowing to a trickle.”

“As things stand, we will run out of food by end of February, coinciding with the peak of the hunger season — when needs are at their highest,” says Niels Balzer, WFP’s Deputy Country Director in Zimbabwe. “Firm pledges are urgently needed as it can take up to three months for funding commitments to become food on people’s tables.”

Global Hotspots 2020 warns that food insecurity levels are the highest in a decade in Zimbabwe, with half the population — 7.7 million people — suffering from severe hunger. WFP hopes to nearly double its assistance to reach up to 4.1 million people.

Also overheating is South Sudan, with the effects of a deadly civil war which displaced 3.8 million people still running deep. A crippled economy, poorly functioning markets, lack of infrastructure and the effects of climate change all hamper recovery efforts.

The report adds: “Parts of the country were hammered by severe drought and flooding in 2019, which has affected close to 1 million people and destroyed over 73,000 metric tons of cereals.”

“Sometimes you end up asking, have the Gods forsaken us?” a South Sudanese woman farmer lamented during a recent field visit by WFP.

Forsaken is certainly how Africa’s Central Sahel region currently appears. Mali, Burkina Faso and Western Niger face a “toxic cocktail” of climate change, war and population displacement, according to Global Hotspots. In Burkina Faso alone, the number of people displaced internally increased by more than 400,000 in 2019.

“Conflict is moving forward and moving fast,” says Margot van der Velden, Director of WFP’s Emergencies Division, in describing the region.

“Every day there are people coming from their villages with horror stories that they were just able to escape. Some try to go back and see if they can get some of their belongings and they don’t come back, so it is assumed they’re killed.”

WFP estimates it will require more than US$10 billion to fully fund all of its operations in more than 80 countries around the world. Without this, planned assistance is under threat.

WFP Executive Director David Beasley says: “Every year at WFP, we plan ahead for the next 12 months and ask for support from the generous governments, private sector institutions and members of the public who help us reach our humanitarian and development goals.” He adds that WFP is “an agency that depends entirely on voluntary donations.”

26418,02548a8c0d9c0c37570eb6322016144c,"Concerned by the environmental and health toll that coal-fired power plants exact, leaders of 12 networks and non-government organizations collectively urged Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc to stop 14 coal-fired plants in Vietnam.

Among the signatories to the statement released Monday are Green Innovation and Development Center (Green ID), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Vietnam Sustainable Energy Alliance, CARE International and Oxfam Vietnam.

The 14 projects, located in eight provinces – Quang Ninh and Bac Giang in northern Vietnam, Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Binh Thuan in central Vietnam, and the southern Long An, Tien Giang and Soc Trang – will have a total capacity of 17,390 MW.

Seven of these have already faced considerable public backlash, while one project has been delayed for eight years and investors of two others are undetermined. For four ongoing projects, provincial authorities are contemplating a switch from coal to gas and ""green energy.""

The collective statement said they were alarmed that the new coal plants under the revised national Power Development Plan VII carry huge risks of damaging the environment and public health, thereby threatening the country’s political and socioeconomic stability.

Under the Plan VII, a total of 60,000 MW is expected to be generated by 2020, with coal-fired plants accounting for 42.7 percent followed by hydropower (30.1 percent), gas-fired plants (14.9 percent), and renewables (9.9 percent).

The collective pointed to a global retreat from investing in fossil fuel projects and the shift to clean and sustainable energy, implying that Vietnam follow suit.

The statement proposes that the government stops the 14 projects and conducts a comprehensive evaluation of their economic feasibility and environmental impacts.

It also proposes that the authorities work on removing obstacles facing ongoing renewable energy projects and that the citizenry is involved at all stages, from the planning of energy projects to their completion.

Dr Bui Thi An, a former National Assembly representative and Director of Institute for Resources, Environment and Community Development (IRECO), said the government should be transparent about the price of coal-fired energy so as to enable a comprehensive comparison with other forms of energy generations.

The statement was released following concerns about the negative impact coal-fired power plants have had on Hanoi’s poor air quality in recent months - first vocalized by Tran Dinh Sinh, deputy director of Green ID.

The accusation was denied by state power utility EVN that runs several plants. EVN said the plants were so far away that they could not pollute the city.

A 2017 study by Harvard University researchers into diseases caused by coal-fired power plants in Southeast Asia estimated that by 2030 Vietnam's premature mortality would be around 19,220 per year, a 4.5-fold increase from 2011, as a result of PM2.5 emitted by coal-fired power plants.

Pham Thi Huong Giang, President of the Song Foundation, a non-profit that helps build new weather-resilient housing in regions frequently stricken by natural disasters in Vietnam, noted that a statement like this was unprecedented.

26500,f5c1bd49f0d28695d10962662822cce9,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey's parliament on Thursday authorized the deployment of troops to Libya to support the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli that is battling forces loyal to a rival government seeking to capture the capital.

Turkish lawmakers voted 325-184 at an emergency session in favor of a one-year mandate allowing the government to dispatch troops amid concerns that Turkish forces could aggravate the conflict in Libya and destabilize the region.

The Tripoli-based government of Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj has faced an offensive by the rival regime in the east and forces loyal to commander Gen. Khalifa Hifter. The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into violent chaos rivaling the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last month that Sarraj requested the Turkish deployment after he and Sarraj signed a deal that allows Ankara to dispatch military experts and personnel to Libya. That deal, along with a separate agreement on maritime boundaries between Turkey and Libya, has led to anger across the region and beyond.

Ankara says the deployment is vital for Turkey to safeguard its interests in Libya and in the eastern Mediterranean, where it finds itself increasingly isolated as Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel have established exclusive economic zones paving the way for oil and gas exploration.

""A Libya whose legal government is under threat can spread instability to Turkey,"" ruling party legislator Ismet Yilmaz argued in defense of the motion. “Those who shy away from taking steps on grounds that there is a risk will throw our children into a greater danger.”

The government has not revealed details about the possible Turkish deployment. The motion allows the government to decide on the scope, amount and timing of any mission.

Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation and discussed the situation in Syria and in Libya, the Turkish president's office said soon after the vote. A brief statement said they discussed “the importance of diplomacy in solving regional issues.”

Egypt’s foreign ministry condemned “in the strongest language” the Turkish parliament’s authorization to deploy troops, saying Turkey would carry full responsibility for the negative effect it would have on the stability of the Mediterranean region.

Egypt, which neighbors Libya, has backed the regime in the country’s east.

The leaders of Greece, Israel and Cyprus denounced the move as a “dangerous threat to regional stability"" and a “dangerous escalation” of the Libyan conflict that violates U.N. resolutions and undermines international peace efforts.

“The repercussions of such a reckless move will be dire for the stability and peace of the entire region,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a joint statement after signing a deal for a pipeline conveying east Mediterranean gas to Europe.

“Ankara should refrain from taking such action, which blatantly violates Libyan national sovereignty and independence.""

Numan Kurtulmus, deputy chairman of Turkey's ruling party, welcomed parliament's vote, telling CNN-Turk television the mandate “will ensure that the legal government in Libya remains in place and Turkey's natural rights (in the Mediterranean) are maintained.""

He added that the mandate does not mean that “troops will be quickly sent tomorrow to conduct operations.”

Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told state-run Anadolu Agency that Turkey would send “the necessary number (of troops) whenever there is a need.” But he also said it would not dispatch forces if Libya's rival government halts its offensive.

Turkey's main opposition party, CHP, had vowed to vote against the motion arguing that the deployment would embroil Turkey in another conflict and make it a party to the further ""shedding of Muslim blood.""

Before the vote, CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu called on the government to work for the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Libya.

Kurtulmus, the ruling party official, said the mandate does not exclude a peacekeeping force. He said, however, the government believes that U.N. peacekeeping missions were not successful in ending conflicts in the past.

Two other opposition parties voted against the motion.

""We cannot throw our soldiers in the line of fire of a civilian war that has nothing to do with our national security,"" Aytun Ciray, a member of the opposition Good Party, said during the parliamentary debate.

However, Erdogan's ruling party is in an alliance with a nationalist party, and the two held sufficient votes for the motion to pass.

Fighting around Tripoli escalated in recent weeks after Hifter declared a “final” and decisive battle for the capital. He has the backing of the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia, while the Tripoli-based government receives aid from Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Armed assailants on Thursday killed three people and injured two others in Kenya’s Lamu county, a coastal region near the border with Somalia, police said.

The county is part of a large swath of territory where Islamist group al Shabaab carries out gun and bomb attacks to pressure Kenya into withdrawing its forces from Somalia.

A Kenyan military contingent forms part of an African Union peacekeeping force that helps defend Somalia’s government against the Islamists.

According to a report by Lamu county police seen by Reuters, the attack took place in the early afternoon when armed men sprayed bullets into a passenger bus.

“Three men were shot at close range,” the report said, adding they had died instantly, while two others were injured.

The report did not give details of the bus’s route or say how many people it was carrying.

In April 2015, al Shabaab fighters stormed Garissa University in the area and sought to kill Christian students. At least 148 people were killed.

The al Qaeda-affiliated al Shabaab seeks to topple Somalia’s government and establish its own rule based on a strict interpretation of sharia law.

Last week al Shabaab claimed responsibility for a bomb attack in Mogadishu in which at least 90 people died."," Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing, not spec below",3

The arrival of the 2020 brings a handful of changes stemming from the 2019 legislative session, including final pieces of enforcing a new law that cracks down on texting and driving. Starting Wednesday, the highway patrol will join other law-enforcement agencies in issuing tickets, instead of warnings, to motorists stopped for texting while driving.

“There’s going to always be education going on, however now it’s going to be enforcement time,” Lt. Derrick Rahming of the highway patrol said. “We never want anyone to learn the hard way, so we gave everyone six months to learn about this law.

Florida in recent years has banned texting while driving, but it had been enforced as a “secondary” offense --- meaning motorists could only be cited for texting if they were stopped for other reasons such as speeding. But the new law (HB 107) made it a “primary” offense, allowing police to pull over motorists for texting behind the wheel.

The law also bars motorists from talking on cell phones in school and work zones, unless the motorists use “hands-free” electronic devices.

Law-enforcement agencies such as the highway patrol phased in enforcement of the law, with troopers issuing warnings to motorists before planning to start writing citations in 2020.

Tickets issued for a first offense carry a $30 fine plus court costs, which could reach $108.16. The fine jumps to $60 --- $158.18 with court costs --- for a second violation within five years.

CLOSE Car insurance companies have taken notice, and their penalties for texting and talking while driving include massive insurance premium increases. Wochit

Because of concerns the law could lead to racial profiling, officers are required to record the race and ethnicity of every violator.

Highway patrol troopers have issued about 800 warnings, which Rahming said shouldn’t be considered low.

“I think it’s right around where it needs to be,” Rahming said. “Throughout the state, we’ve had 1,151 citations issued (by all law enforcement) since the law started in July.”

Rahming said people putting down their phones while driving will make the roads safer.

“When you are sitting inside of a patrol car, you are going to see a lot of things. One of the things you will see is someone distracted in their vehicle,” Rahming said. “The number one thing we want to do is make sure everyone has their mind on driving and they are doing everything they need to, to make sure they are focused on driving.”

Among other changes taking effect Wednesday:

As part of an $87 million tax relief package (HB 7123), a sales-tax rate on commercial leases will be trimmed from 5.7 percent to 5.5 percent. The reduction is expected produce a $30.8 million cut in state and local taxes in the remaining six months of the fiscal year. Over a full year, the savings are estimated at $64.5 million.

A new law (HB 831) requires health care practitioners to transmit prescriptions electronically, with certain exceptions.

A new law (HB 409), allows remote, online notarization of documents.

A new law (HB 427), establishes the Honor and Remember Flag, which will honor members of the military who have died in the line of duty.

26891,43c10019735aeaaa71f78f988666228d,"Authored by Ryan McMaken via The Mises Institute,

On December 29, an armed gunman entered the West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas and shot two members of the congregation. Within six seconds, a third member of the congregation drew a weapon and shot the gunman dead.

The events were captured on live-streamed video, with the dramatic events — in the minds of many observers — highlighting the benefits of privately-owned firearms as a defense against armed criminals. Moreover, the gunman, who had a criminal history, obtained his gun illegally, and demonstrated one of the central pitfalls of the gun-control narrative: namely, that those with criminal intent are not easily restrained by laws controlling access to firearms.

Nonetheless, many media outlets were unable to bring themselves to admit that privately owned firearms in this case were the key in preventing a wider massacre. After all, had the congregation waited around for the police to arrive, it is unknown how effective a police response could have been. Nor is it clear that had the police arrived quickly, they would have immediately engaged the shooter or even engaged the right person.

These considerations were not sufficient to divert many media observers from their insistence that private gun ownership is helpful in situations like these. Both government agents and their media boosters continue to insist that even well-meaning ordinary citizens ought not be trusted with firearms and that what is really needed are ""experts"" with government-approved police training.

Elvia Diaz at the Arizona Republic demonstrated this premise well when she wrote :

The reality of Wilson's heroism is a lot more complex. He wasn’t just an ordinary parishioner, as gun advocates may want you to believe. The church’s volunteer security team member is a firearms instructor , gun range owner and former reserve deputy with a local sheriff’s department, according to a New York Times detailed account. In other words, he’s exactly the kind of man you want around with a firearm. But we know nothing about the at least six other parishioners who also appeared to draw their handguns at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas. And that's terrifying.

To many people who aren't left-leaning journalists, it is hardly ""terrifying"" that some other private citizens of unknown expertise were armed in the congregation. After all, these people never fired a shot once they saw the shooter had been incapacitated. None of them provided any reason to suspect they pose any risk to anyone else.

On the other hand, 2019 has provided plenty of reminders of what sort of ""expertise"" and heroism government-provided security forces offer.

In the Spring of 2019, the parents of victims of the Parkland school shooting are sued the Broward County school board and the sheriff's office for failing to take timely action against the school shooter who killed 17 people at the school in February 2018. According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel , police officers repeatedly sought to protect themselves rather than the victims in the school. An analysis of communications among law enforcement officers at the site of the massacre confirmed there were ""at least two times a Broward deputy urges another officer to protect themselves, not confront the killer.""

Meanwhile, 2019 provided reminders police officers will shoot citizens dead in their own homes for no justifiable reason, as was the case with Atatiana Jefferson on October 12. According to multiple accounts the shooter — a now-former-cop named Aaron Dean — entered Jefferson's private property unannounced in the middle of the night. He peered into Jefferson's windows, and within seconds, the officer had shot Jefferson dead. Jefferson had been playing video games with her nephew.

Also in October, former police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced to ten years in prison for unlawfully shooting Botham Jean in his own apartment. At the time, Guyger was a police officer returning home from work. She illegally entered the wrong apartment and promptly shot Jean — the unit's lawful resident — dead.

If there is anything that ought to be ""terrifying"" to ordinary Americans, it is not the idea that some law abiding citizens might be carrying firearms. Rather, the far-more terrifying thought is the knowledge some police officers are so eager to murder residents in their own living rooms.

More Guns, More Crime?

These facts will no doubt fail to derail the usual media narrative that there are too many guns, and the police — the same people who shoot residents in their homes or cower behind cars when faced with real danger — will ensure public safety through weapons prohibitions and by generally ""keeping us safe.""

Fortunately, the facts certainly offer little to support the idea that more legal gun ownership is a problem in terms of homicides.

According to 2019's gun manufacturing data from the BATF, total gun production and importation in the US has increased significantly over the past twenty years. If we look at total guns produced in the US (not counting those exported) and added to total guns imported, we find new gun production increased from around 4.5 million in 1998 to more than twelve million in 2017.1 Over that same period, homicide rates decreased from 6.3 per 100,000 to 5.3. In fact, after years of rising gun production, the US homicide rate fell to a 50-year low in 2014. This correlation doesn't prove more guns reduce crime, of course. But this relationship strongly suggests the benefits of increased gun ownership — namely greater self-defense capability on the part of private citizens — are greater than the potential costs.

Moreover, new data on homicides released in September 2019 shows the homicide rate in the US has fallen two years in a row since 2016, and is nearly down to half of the national homicide rates reported during the early 1990s.

Many states with weak gun-control laws are also among the states with the lowest homicide rates. For instance, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine — all of which have few gun restrictions — report remarkably low homicide rates. Other gun-permissive states like Utah, Iowa, and South Dakota all have homicide rates comparable to Canadian provinces, although we're told Canada only has low homicide rates because of gun restrictions. Clearly there's more behind the reality of violent crime than is suggested by the usual ""more gun control means less crime"" claims.

Many anti-private-gun-ownership activists continue to insist that only police officers and other government personnel ought to be carrying firearms, and that the police will protect the people from violence criminals. Yet, it's unclear why the public ought to accept this rather strained claim. In 2019, police were repeatedly shown to endanger the public while pursuing their own safety. Meanwhile, the end of the year brought another case of private gun owners stopping a murderous gunman far more effectively than police ever could have. Nor was the Texas church case the only notable example we can recall this year. It is entirely possible, of course, that cases like these are not typical or representative examples of police behavior or what happens when armed criminal gunmen attack innocents. But there's no denying the optics this year were bad for the pro-gun-control side. Faced with the choice of owning a gun for protection, or trusting in police for protection, many apparently continue to choose the former."," Threaten, not specified below",3

I’ll be honest. I’ve kept a one of my many spare eyes on MiniLAW in the hope that it would overcome its horrible controls. Having gone back to it today, I can say that it sort of has. The controls are a lot better than they were, especially using a controller. But they’re still awkward, and the keyboard-and-mouse controls border on maddening. Space to aim? SPACE? Shift is ‘use’, but F is dash, and you can’t run unless you dash first. Melee attacks are right click but blocking with your arms is stuck to the E button. Ludicrous. Fortunately those defaults can be changed, but it does feel markedly better with a pad.

Other than that, MiniLAW is bloody great. You’re a future cyber-cop, sent out in a flying patrol car to subdue a variety of criminal groups who are running wild during a mass panic about a mysterious figure who’s hidden a nuclear bomb somewhere in the city. Scores, probably a few hundred blocks flare up into violence as you travel the city map, so you have to visit them and put down the troublemakers, either lethally, non-lethally, or verbally.

The best approach is usually to mix all three, since although you get more points with which to buy upgrades, weapons, and augmentations by playing non-lethally, many of the suspects are very hard to persuade, and picking them off with a gun is the only sensible option. That gets tricky when you’re ordered to bring in specific targets alive, but that’s the job. You get multiple ‘lives’ too, resurrecting on the spot with zappy defibrillator effects.

If you have a controller, I’d say it’s well worth playing. Its variety in weapons, playstyles, and stat-altering character backgrounds make for a lot of replay value, and the shooting and high-pressure decision making carry it a long way.

In a letter of reassurance sent to French Banking Federation, first reported by AFP, Le Maire explained that although the situation was ""a cause for legitimate concern, both for the banks and those of their clients affected by the TIN requirement"", once the 2019 deadline had passed, ""the absence of transmission of the TIN by the banks will in no way characterise, immediately and automatically, a significant breach of their obligations with regards to FATCA rules"".

The FATCA international tax code was intended to clamp down on international tax avoidance, but many Americans living abroad have found it has also caused problems for them.

The controversy in France and other countries is the US tax system deems anyone with a connection to the States is a taxpayer even if they only lived in the country for a short time as a child. And as a US citizen, they are obliged to pay tax on their worldwide earnings.

These taxpayers with a tenuous link are called ‘accidental Americans' and many do not realise they are subject to paying taxes in the US.

Banks in France had previously warned that they could be forced to close up to 40,000 accounts belonging to US citizens because of ongoing difficulties with FATCA.

27027,34bcfd506bda0dd6d252001f0f67f63f,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump played down rhetorical attacks from Kim Jong Un as the end-of-the-year holidays passed Wednesday without any new nuclear tests in North Korea – but with threats of future ones.



""If the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward the DPRK (North Korea), there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula,"" the Korean Central News Agency said, quoting Kim as he announced he no longer feels bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing.

Trump, speaking with reporters at his annual New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, said he still has ""a very good relationship"" with Kim, with whom he has met three times.

""He likes me, I like him, we get along,"" Trump said, adding: ""He did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization. ... I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out.""



In announcing that his moratorium on nuclear testing is no longer operative, Kim also told a meeting of ruling party officials in North Korea he would unveil a ""new strategic weapon"" in the near future, the state news agency said. Kim had given the United States an end-of-the-year deadline to reduce economic sanctions on his country or face the prospect of new nuclear tests.

""The DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy,"" the Korean Central News Agency reported Kim as saying.

© Evan Vucci, AP President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in 2018.

Trump administration officials had feared such a test during the holiday – a North Korea official had threatened a ""Christmas gift"" to the U.S. – but nothing had happened as midnight passed in North Korea.

In speaking with reporters, Trump joked that he hoped Kim's ""Christmas present"" was ""a beautiful vase ... as opposed to something else.""

Trump remains hopeful of a denuclearization agreement with North Korea, though critics say Kim's government has continued to develop nuclear programs even after the two leaders signed a document at their first summit in June of 2018. The two men also met in 2019 in Vietnam and at the North Korea-South Korea border.

While Trump often cites the Singapore agreement as a hopeful sign, critics pointed out that it was nonspecific and nonbinding when it came to North Korea giving up nuclear weapons.



""Kim signed nothing binding regarding nukes or missiles. No Kim ever has,"" tweeted Robert E. Kelly, professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea.

He added: ""And Republicans used to know that the Kims shouldn’t be trusted. But now the GOP’s a cult of personality, right? So if the great leader says it’s true, it must be so.""

27069,2cdd3bce768dbce797edf8642631812f,"The FDA is reportedly taking unprecedented action to try and stop the teen vaping epidemic. Under the direction of the Trump administration, it will likely announce a ban on mint, fruit and dessert flavored e-cigarette cartridges as soon as Friday.



The ban reportedly will not include the sale of menthol or tobacco flavors.

Insiders told CBS News that President Trump has been hesitant to ban flavored e-cigarettes based on advice that his supporters would react negatively to it. Now anti-vaping activists accuse the administration of siding with e-cigarette companies and the vaping industry.

Matt Myers heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. He says banning flavors is good, but leaving menthol and tobacco vaping products on the market is dangerous.



""This policy is one that was dictated by the e-cigarette industry,"" Myers said. ""Menthol cigarettes are used by more than half of all kids as they start a product.""



His group says one-third of all e-cigarette users in the U.S. are middle and high school students, and 97% of kids use flavored pods.



President Trump hinted at the ban this week.



""We'll be taking it off, the flavors for a period of time-- certain flavors,"" Trump said. ""We're gonna protect our families, we're gonna protect our children and we're gonna protect the industry.""

A few months ago, CBS News spoke to 18-year-old Chance Ammirata. His doctor believes his vaping may have contributed to a lung injury.

""I never thought I'd be addicted,"" Ammirata said. ""And I'm sure every other teenager or young adult would say the same exact thing.""

The Centers for Disease Control counts more than 2,500 cases of people hospitalized with e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury and 55 deaths. The CDC says the chemical vitamin E acetate, found in some vaping products, is ""closely associated"" with the deaths and illnesses.

In August, Tony Dokoupil sat down with then-Juul CEO Kevin Burns, who said the company never intended to target kids to grow the business.

""I've said this before, I'm sorry that their kids are using the product,"" Burns said. ""We never intended for our product to be used by them.""

Some vape shop owners worry a ban will also hurt business. Arizona vape shop co-owner Scout Stubbs says she's already expanding to hemp products to offset a drop in sales.



""If we just enforce the laws we already have, or maybe beef them up, have some marketing restrictions, there are solutions out there to combat youth usage that don't involve banning adult products,"" Stubbs said.



Myers disagrees.



""This is not an issue about jobs, this is an issue about the health of our nation's children,"" Myers said.

27113,4d14be504f0ed8917f363a9f5fd4000e,"The opioid crisis continues to tear at the fabric of American society 14 months after widely supported bipartisan legislation was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Some progress has been made, though much more is needed. And without near-term action from Washington, the situation could get worse.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug abuse deaths have declined 4.7% from 2017 to May 2019, yet the numbers remain staggering. For the 12-month period that ended May 2019, the CDC reported 67,071 deaths, compared with 70,237 deaths in 2017. Opioids are involved in two-thirds of drug abuse deaths, taking more lives than car crashes or shootings.

Many solutions are required, including reducing needless opioid prescriptions and strengthening treatment programs. There is also a vital international law enforcement component. The Department of Justice reports, “China is the principal source country of fentanyl-like substances and other synthetic opioids, producing most illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-like substances that reach U.S. users.”

To tackle this, Washington should do the following.

• Enact legislation banning fentanyl analogues by Feb. 6. There is a loophole in federal law by which drug traffickers can make minor structural modifications to fentanyl and potentially face lower penalties than if they imported, distributed or manufactured the base drug. In 2018, the Department of Justice addressed this, implementing an emergency order that treats trafficking in copycat products the same as trafficking in fentanyl. The order, issued under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, expires Feb. 6.

The best way to address this issue is for Congress to enact legislation by Feb. 6 that removes any doubt that Justice can permanently make such classifications. The Justice Department warned the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 4 that without legislation, “the department would enter unchartered legal and regulatory terrain. It is unknown whether a newly encountered fentanyl-like substance, having just been allowed to lapse from the class scheduling regime, could later be quickly subject to temporary control.”

At a July 1 news conference, Amanda Liskamm, the department’s director of Opioid Enforcement and Prevention, was more direct, saying, “Prosecutors will undoubtedly be hindered, and drug traffickers will undoubtedly be helped.”

• Full-court press to immediately inspect China’s mail. A central provision of the 2018 drug legislation is a requirement that all incoming mail and packages from China, effective Jan. 1, 2019, have advanced electronic data (AED). This information, which includes the sender and recipient’s address and the declared contents, enables suspicious mail to be identified and seized more quickly. However, 15% of mail and packages from China still do not have AED.

As part of continuing trade and other discussions, the Trump administration should press China to make sure its postal service, China Post, has AED on all out-bound U.S. mail and packages. This is the most direct and clear way to ensure compliance.

• Push for more stringent international mail standards. International mail standards are set by the Universal Postal Union, which is affiliated with the United Nations. This past September, the State Department and Peter Navarro, the president’s director of trade and manufacturing policy, secured a major victory at the UPU based on an eminently fair request: that foreign shippers will pay the same as U.S. ones for the services of the U.S. Postal Service.

Building off this, the United States should push for stringent AED and customs standards at the UPU when the organization holds its annual four-year conference in August. AED technology is readily available to ensure better postal inspections. And, with drug traffickers likely to improvise and use additional shipping points than China, such an international agreement is timely.

The fight against opioids and drug abuse deaths requires many actions and vigilance. At this time of year especially, it is important to renew resolve on this important fight.

“For more than a year, NPPC has advocated for an increase in the number of agricultural inspectors at our borders,”​ said NPPC president David Herring. “We applaud the House, especially Reps. Vela, Thompson, Peterson, Axne, Carbajal, Gonzalez, Costa, Rouzer and Fortenberry, for approving an essential provision to reduce the risk of ASF and other FADs and to protect the rural economy from a devastating outbreak. We also thank the USDA and Customs and Border Protection for all they have done to strengthen US biosecurity.”​

The NPPC suggests that the most likely way ASF or another foreign animal disease (FAD) could enter the country would be through the importation of infected animals or contaminated products. It warns that an outbreak of certain FADs would “immediately close US pork export markets, with significant harm to farmers, consumers and overall economy”​.

The trade body added that it continues to advocate for other FAD preparedness measures, including establishing a US Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccine bank as provided for in the 2018 Farm Bill, warning that the US does not currently have access to enough vaccine to quickly contain and eradicate an FMD outbreak.

27182,1d9eff5bd95822a9de232d364dd212ce,"The Nepali government is seeking to build roads to every village in the mountainous nation. But some warn the road boom could have high costs for communities and the environment, especially in areas where traditional livelihoods and trek tourism rely on unspoiled nature.

The Manaslu Conservation Area in the Himalayan Mountains of north-central Nepal is a 642-square-mile protected area that has yet to be connected by road to the outside world. The route for trekkers, opened more than two decades ago, follows a deep river gorge, ascends through hardwood and conifer forests, weaves through villages, and emerges into alpine pasturelands north of Mount Manaslu, which, at 26,781 feet, is the world’s eighth-highest peak. The glacier-flanked trail then crosses a 17,000-foot pass before descending into the region of the Annapurna massif, with peaks climbing to 26,000 feet. The views on the Manaslu trek are among the most breathtaking in Nepal. Manaslu’s local Nubri people trace their lineage to neighboring Tibet, and for centuries have herded yak and tended fields in what they view as a sacred landscape. But despite protected area status and growing dependence on trek tourism income, three road projects are converging simultaneously on this narrow, long-isolated valley. “The lakes here are pristine, the wildlife is abundant, and our ancient culture is alive,” says local ward chairman and trekking lodge owner Pema Döndrup. “We need to preserve this area.” The valley’s old-growth forests contain trees that have escaped cutting, villagers say, because they are too large to safely fell by hand. But the new road projects will bring trucks, diesel-hydraulic excavators, and chainsaws to the region, the latter a major threat in view of the powerful hunger for lumber in Nepal’s lowland cities and in near-treeless Tibet. The roads being built to the Manaslu region are part of an ambitious new effort in Nepal to construct paved, gravel, or dirt roads to every town and sizeable settlement in the country. As this frenzy of road construction gnaws into even the most remote valleys of the Himalayas, subsistence farmers and traders — long neglected by Nepal’s government — are hoping the roads will bring jobs, lower trade and transportation costs, and improved education and health care to the country’s far-flung corners. New roads already have expanded access and economic opportunity in populated lowland areas. But in remote areas of the Himalayas where traditional livelihoods (and trek tourism incomes) rely on unspoiled natural resources, some local officials and residents fear that the socio-economic and environmental costs of this road-building spree will be high.

With little public discussion, roads are even being built into national parks and protected areas.

These critics note that most mountain roads are being crudely dug along riverbanks, through alpine wetland ecosystems, and across slopes that are prone to landslides and pummeling monsoon rains. With little official or public discussion, roads are even surging into national parks and protected areas, such as Manaslu. Some Nepalis fear an increase in damage to sacred sites, an expansion of timber cutting in heretofore-inaccessible woodlands, and a growing trade in endangered and threatened species, particularly with China, Nepal’s neighbor to the north. In recent decades, Nepal has gone from having few drivable roads to more than 7,000 miles of paved roads, as of 2015. Yet over the last several years, the pace of road building has quickened dramatically, driven by the country’s new constitution, enacted in 2015, which emphasizes decentralized economic growth and includes a directive that roads be constructed to remote settlements. According to the Department of Roads, Nepal built an additional 7,500 miles of new paved, gravel, or dirt roads in 2017 and 2018. The road-building boom is being funded by international development agencies, the Nepalese government, and countries such as China. The contours of China’s involvement in the road projects are evolving, but China is keen to include transit through Nepal in its global, trillion-dollar-plus Belt and Road Initiative. With China’s financial help, Nepal’s Strategic Road Network is simultaneously pushing northward from the sub-tropical lowlands and south from the border with the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. In a visit in October to Kathmandu, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke of a desire to forge a “strategic partnership” with Nepal that would include extension of rail and road infrastructure to Nepal’s southern border with India. Nepal’s road-building initiative is also being driven by internal cronyism and corruption, according to some experts.

“We’re seeing what’s referred to as ‘bulldozer terrorism,’” says Dipak Gyawali, former Minister of Water Resources. “A very high percentage of newly empowered local and regional politicians also own bulldozers or excavators. They secure the funding, then award themselves the construction contracts.” Landowners near the proposed routes also are benefitting, with property values predictably increasing, sometimes substantially, along road routes. The growing pace of road construction can be seen in some recent economic and industrial statistics. In 2017, the Indian heavy equipment manufacturing giant JCB sold 2,140 pieces of equipment to Nepal — the highest number of backhoe loaders and excavators sold in any country of South Asia. The Nepali Times reported last year that 83,000 diesel-hydraulic earth movers were operating in the country. Underlying the concern about Nepal’s runaway road construction is the impact of opening up large, relatively unspoiled regions of the Himalayan nation to development. Pasang Sherpa, a former member of Parliament from far northeastern Nepal, has catalyzed a political consensus to delay road construction into the fragile high valleys of the Mewa River drainage area, in the shadows of Mount Kanchenjunga (28,169 feet) and Mount Makalu (27,766 feet). This biodiverse landscape features an abundance of alpine meadows and lakes, snow leopard, blue sheep, and wolves. The area is the source of rich origin myths for the local Limbu and Dhokpya Sherpa ethnic groups. They harvest sizable quantities of dwarf rhododendron and dwarf juniper, and transport it by yak train for regional sale as incense. Road access would expedite this exploitation.

Trade in endangered species in Nepal could significantly worsen as roads reach more remote areas.

“We’re saying, ‘yes,’ bring the roads as far as the lower villages of those valleys — but not above and beyond them,” Sherpa says. “When people along the roadway below my village found themselves working as day laborers for wealthy outside businesspeople, and saw their houses coated in dust, they began to raise questions. I describe to them the area below Mount Everest, which is thriving economically without a road.” Along with local members of a social welfare committee and an NGO called KTK-BELT, Sherpa is proposing designating these upper drainages as the Alpine Dhokpya Ramsar Wetlands Conservation Area, which would, in principal, exclude road excavation. Elected officials, including at the ministerial level, are beginning to embrace the concept. Shant Raj Jnawali oversees the U.S. AID-supported WWF-Hariyo Ban (“Green Forest”) Program, which is working to protect a relatively unspoiled corridor in west Nepal. “No one cares about environmental safeguards,” he says flatly. “Road EIAs [environmental impact assessments] go uncommissioned, or at best are disregarded.” He acknowledges the desire among Nepalis for higher standards of living, but as the local environments and resources that villagers depend upon are increasingly exploited, he sees diminishing benefits from growth.

Many of these villagers are leaving anyway to seek jobs and education in cities and abroad, and are being replaced by new arrivals and temporary workers who have little interest in long-term stewardship. As a result, objection to environmental and cultural impacts is muted. “The conservation value of one’s personal attachment to their homeland can’t be overstated,” says Jnawali, “and this goes missing as people move away.” One important environmental concern is that the trade in endangered species in Nepal could significantly worsen as roads are carved into evermore remote areas. Nepal has long been known as a transit country for tiger skin, musk deer pods, and other endangered animal parts, typically carried from India on foot over Himalayan passes to pharmaceutical markets in China and Vietnam. Villagers, in the habit of questioning outsiders passing through their valleys, have acted as unofficial monitors of this trade. But the bellies of trucks and jeeps offer cover for shipments that can pass undetected (or with collusion of authorities) around villages and through jurisdictional checkpoints. The sheer danger that roads present is also a major cause of concern. A study conducted by mountain hazard scientist Dave Petley, a professor of geography at the University of Sheffield, showed an increase in landslides, often fatal, coinciding with ad hoc road construction in Nepal. Road maintenance funds are seldom provided in budgets. A 2013 World Bank report estimated that as many as 18,000 miles of Nepal’s roads have little hope of being properly maintained over the long term. In many cases, hastily trained bulldozer drivers are acting as impromptu engineers, deciding on the spot where to build roads. They use dizzying switchbacks to negotiate steep terrain, and road rights-of-way can consume and destabilize entire hillsides. Vertical road cuts as high as 50 feet sever traditional foot trails, rendering them impassable for pedestrians and pack animals.

“What do we mean by ‘development’? And on whose terms are we going to transition into the future?” asks a local critic of the road-building approach.

“Significant environmental damage is mistakenly viewed as a necessary cost of rural development,” says Karen Bennett, a watershed scientist working with the Nepal River Conservation Trust. She stresses that robust, durable roads can be constructed in the mountains. “Careful alignment, drainage that can handle monsoon rains, a grade of less than 10 percent, and management of massive debris fans – these can all be designed and planned for.” Bennett singles out the habit of “side casting” – dumping the cut material directly onto the slope below – as a major contributor to slope instability. End hauling, or transporting the material to a low-angle, stable location, is one of many “green” road building techniques that could be applied. This could well save lives. Bus plunges and other vehicle accidents occur routinely in Nepal. In a recent three and a half month period, 538 deaths were recorded on Nepal’s roads, an average of five per day. At that rate, 18,000 people would perish on roads in the next 10 years – more than the number killed in conflict during the brutal Maoist insurgency from 1996 to 2006. Alternatives exist. “Ropeways,” or electricity-powered aerial cable cars, offer a lower-impact (and often cheaper) transport option that nicely dovetails with Nepal’s growing hydropower capacity. An 11-mile cargo-only ropeway is now being planned just south of Mount Everest, on the trek route to the Sherpa village of Namche Bazaar. This should reduce the need for the near-endless mule trains that currently supply the park’s 60,000 annual foreign visitors and rapidly growing numbers of Nepali trekkers.

Road construction presents a rural development conundrum: for decades, foreign aid programs have strived to include local villagers’ labor, skills, and decision-making at the forefront of their assistance. “But when heavy equipment is introduced on the scene, that becomes a useless development model,” notes Sonam Lama, an architect and filmmaker from the valley of Tsum, located within the Manaslu Conservation Area. “The villagers are told to stand aside while the dozers and excavators do all the work. It’s a one-way process, with no transfer of knowledge or training, and no employment for the local people. Then it’s left to us to repair the incidental damage, and maintain it all.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3
27212,22b0e19735f990bd358d777b24e3ad96,"ANKARA/ISTANBUL — Turkish lawmakers are set to back a bill on Thursday that allows troop deployment in Tripoli, but that is likely to begin with military support, training and drones in the air rather than boots on the ground.

President Tayyip Erdogan, whose ruling party’s alliance has a majority but faces opposition to the plan in parliament, said last week Turkey would deploy troops in Libya to support Fayez al-Serraj’s internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).

The GNA has requested Turkish support as it fights off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar’s forces in the country’s east that is backed by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan.

Analysts and officials say Ankara is unlikely to immediately send troops, but rather military advisers and equipment.

A senior Turkish official said last week Turkey may train Libyan soldiers in Turkey, and Reuters reported that Ankara is also considering sending allied Syrian fighters to Tripoli as part of the planned military support.

On Wednesday, Vice President Fuat Oktay said the bill served a symbolic role that Ankara hoped would be a “deterrent” to the parties, and that Turkey may not send troops if Haftar’s forces halted their offensive and pulled back.

“The deployment will likely start with military advisers, increased (drones), and special operations that would work with the Libyan military,” said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who is chairman of the think-tank Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies.

“The hope would be that the Turkish military may not itself be involved in military action,” he said.

Erdogan’s ruling AK Party and its nationalist allies are expected to back the legislation on Thursday despite opposition from the other major parties that say military support would cause Libya’s conflict to spread across the region and endanger Turkey’s safety.

Ankara signed a military cooperation accord with Tripoli in November and has said it would help prevent Libya sliding into “chaos.” It is also meant to protect Turkish private investment in Libya and bolster Turkey’s offshore energy claims in the Mediterranean.

But it could also put Turkey at odds with the other foreign players in Libya’s war and in the region. The Arab League is the latest to warn against the deployment of foreign fighters in the North African country.

“Ankara sees its involvement in Libya as a symbol of its new status as a regional power,” said Asli Aydintasbas, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The idea is, to be at the big table, you need to be present on the ground.”

Ankara has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a U.N. report seen by Reuters.

Better drones from Turkey could help the GNA.

The U.N. said Haftar’s Chinese-made drones, which were provided by the UAE and have a broad range, flew 800 air strikes until November, while the GNA’s Turkish-made drones carried out 200.

At the end of 2019, the ""dream"" project of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the 45-kilometre Istanbul Canal that will cross Istanbul and serve as a double for the Bosphorus strait, finally received approval from the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) eliminating one of the last obstacles in the new canal's path to being implemented.

Turkey expects to resolve several issues pertaining to the Bosphorus strait. Turkish authorities have argued that the strait is overloaded with ships often waiting in a queue to cross the only maritime waterway connecting the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara and the Mediterranean. In addition, President Erdogan noted that the project will bring profits to Ankara, which is currently forced to charge only minimum fees for vessels passing through the Bosphorus due to its being regulated under the Montreux Convention of 1936.

Despite the EIA's positive assessment of the project its opponents continue to fight it, claiming that the endeavour remains too costly for both the country and for the environment. They argue that the $10 billion price tag for such a canal is ""not realistic"".

Opponents of the Istanbul Canal received renewed hope in June 2019, when Ekrem Imamoglu from the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) came to power as mayor of Istanbul and vowed to oppose the project in any way he can. Imamoglu slammed Erdogan's ""dream"" canal as a ""betrayal of Istanbul"" and a ""murder project"" ditching the cooperation protocol between the city and the country's government on the waterway's construction.

Erdogan, however, dismissed Imamoglu's criticism and stated that Ankara doesn't need the city's approval for a project conceived on a national level.

27354,7ced8c5d66ce41f1dc9f14d8021d368e,"On 30 December 2019, pastor Wang Yi of the Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu, China, was sentenced to nine years in prison. Responding Patrick Poon, China researcher at Amnesty International, said: “Today’s verdict makes a mockery of China's supposed religious freedoms. Wang Yi was merely practicing his religion and peacefully standing up for human rights in China.

“This nine-year sentence is appalling and unjust. Wang Yi is a prisoner of conscience and must be immediately and unconditionally released. It speaks volumes that Wang Yi felt he needed to prepare a statement in advance refuting the court’s conclusions, together with any ‘confessions’ he might be forced to make. In China, religious practitioners live under the permanent threat of politically-motivated prosecution and conviction.”

Pastor Wang Yi of the Early Rain Covenant Church was sentenced to nine years at the Chengdu City Intermediate People’s Court in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan. He had been charged with “illegal business operation” and “inciting subversion of state power,” a catch-all charge often used against dissidents and activists who speak out against the government.

In early December 2018, police in Chengdu raided the premises of the Early Rain Covenant Church. About 100 members of the church, including Wang Yi, were taken away and questioned by the police in the following days. Some of them said they were asked to sign a document guaranteeing that they would not take part in the meetings of the church again.

Three days after the raid, the church issued a written statement that Wang Yi had prepared several months in advance, in which he expressed determination to defend religious freedom.

Wang wrote: “Regardless of what crime the government charges me with, whatever filth they fling at me, as long as this charge is related to my faith, my writings, my comments and my teachings, it is merely a lie and temptation of demons. I categorically deny it. I will serve my sentence, but I will not serve the law. I will be executed, but I will not plead guilty.”

Founded in 2005, the Early Rain Covenant Church is one of the largest and most prominent ‘house churches’ in China. The leaders and members of the church did not want to register with the Religious Affairs Bureau or the “Three-Self Patriotic Association”, as Protestant churches are required to do in order to be recognised by the government. These churches are commonly referred to as ‘house churches’ because they usually gather to worship in members’ homes. Local officials can bring criminal and administrative sanctions against practitioners who carry out activities outside of state-approved “patriotic religious associations”.

Many Catholics, Protestants, Tibetan Buddhists, Uyghur Muslims and Falun Gong practitioners have been harassed or even imprisoned in the struggle to freely practice their religion or beliefs, but recent regulations and amendments have tightened the Chinese government’s grip on religious practice.

“Israeli Army Minister (sic., Minister of Defense) Naftali Bennett yesterday, Wednesday [Dec. 25, 2019], signed an order seizing the money of the families of eight prisoners from the 1948 territories (i.e., Israel), claiming that they are monthly salaries (rawatib) they received from the PA.

Bennett took pride in his decision to steal the prisoners’ money, and claimed that ‘This is the first step that Israel is carrying out directly’ against the prisoners who receive monthly salaries from the PA, claiming that the salaries ‘encourage’ carrying out operations (i.e., terror attacks). He also threatened to seize the money of additional prisoners in the future.

The prisoners who were included in the money seizure order: Muwaffaq Naif Hassan Uruq (i.e., terrorist, led two suicide bombers who murdered 23), Ibrahim Muhammad Ibrahim Al-Bakri, Yassin Hassan Saleh Al-Bakri (i.e., terrorist brothers, aided suicide bomber who murdered 9), Hikmat Fahim Mustafa Na’amneh (i.e., involved in funding illegal organizations assaulting and intimidating Jews on the Temple Mount), Muhammad Sa’id Tawfiq Jabarin (i.e., terrorist involved in the Night of the Pitchforks, 3 murdered), Walid Daqqa (i.e., terrorist, involved in murder of 1), Samir Saleh Taha Sarsawi (i.e., terrorist, threw a hand grenade), and Mujahid Muhammad Yusuf Dhouqan (i.e., attempted to bomb an Israeli rail line near Netanya in cooperation with Fatah terrorists).

In response to the decision, Director of [PLO] Commission of Prisoners and Released Prisoners' Affairs Qadri Abu Bakr said that the decision is blatant robbery and open theft of the rights of the prisoners’ families.

He added that the salaries that the commission is paying the prisoners, independent of their place of residence, are allowances that provide their families with a living, a place to live, health, education, and so on, and we will not relinquish this obligation regardless of the extremist Israeli ways of thwarting them [the allowances], seizing them, or stealing them like highway robbers.”

Muwaffaq Naif Hassan Uruq – Arab-Israeli terrorist who led two suicide bombers to their double attack in Tel Aviv in which 23 people were murdered and dozens injured on Jan. 5, 2003. Uruq is serving a 30-year sentence.

Ibrahim Al-Bakri – Israeli Arab terrorist who, together with his brother Yassin, assisted the terrorist who committed the suicide attack on bus no. 361 at the Meron Junction in northern Israel on Aug. 4, 2002, in which 9 were murdered and approximately 50 wounded. Al-Bakri is serving 9 life sentences and an additional 30 years.

The Night of the Pitchforks - Four Islamic Jihad terrorists entered an army training camp and used knives, axes, and a pitchfork to murder three sleeping soldiers Guy Friedman, Yaakov Dubinsky, and Yuri Ferda on Feb. 14, 1992. The Israeli Arab terrorists Ibrahim Agbaria, Yahia Agbaria, Muhammad Agbaria, and Muhammad Jabarin are each serving 3 life sentences. The attack, near Kibbutz Gilad in northern Israel, is known as “the night of the pitchforks.”

Walid Daqqa - Israeli Arab member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). He is serving a life sentence for being part of the squad that kidnapped and murdered Israeli soldier Moshe Tamam in 1984.

Samir Sarsawi – Israeli Arab terrorist and Fatah member who threw a hand grenade on Nordau St. in Haifa in 1988. Sarsawi was sentenced to life for the grenade throwing and his involvement in other terror attacks, but Israeli President Shimon Peres reduced his sentence to 30 years in 2012, and Sarsawi was released in November 2018."," Conduct suicide, car, or other non-military bombing, not spec below",3

27839,cf1ddf635be5798555bb8f4b0e4b4658,"Swedish political science professor Tommy Möller has warned that the unprecedented mass migration into Sweden in the last decade could unravel the country’s “democratic welfare society.”

Professor Möller, who teaches at Stockholm University, has claimed that political stability in Sweden has been greatly affected by mass migration, stating that it could be relegated to a museum in an op-ed published by Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri.

“No matter what happens, no one can deny that our society has undergone significant changes as a result of the extensive immigration, and these demographic changes will permeate Swedish politics for the foreseeable future,” Moller said and highlighted the rise of the anti-mass migration Sweden Democrats (SD) who have topped recent opinion polls.

Malmö Shooting Suspects Overwhelmingly from Migrant Backgrounds https://t.co/pN0x73IFAY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 24, 2019

“Problems in health care and school, the municipalities’ increased costs for supply support, housing shortages and, not least, the accelerating gang crime – all of these are problems and some of them have been linked by SD with immigration,” he said.

Mass migration has been linked to several of those issues such as in the southern city of Malmo where the vast majority of shooting suspects in a Swedish media report released earlier this year were from migrant backgrounds.

Municipalities who took in large shares of asylum seekers and migrants since the height of the 2015 migrant crisis have also seen financial difficulties, such as the municipality of Bengtsfors which claimed it risked bankruptcy earlier this year.

Swedish Municipality That Took Too Many Migrants Faces Bankruptcy https://t.co/yq4XgAw30d — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) August 3, 2019

The professor went on to add that polarization and cultural conflicts were on the rise, warning, “Unless the integration of the newly arrived succeeds better, in the long run, the social putty that makes a democratic welfare society of our kind possible risks being torn apart.”

“Unfortunately, the interpersonal trust that is a prerequisite for a large-scale society to function has decreased in Sweden in recent years,” Moller said and added, “Gaps between people, whether economic or cultural, create a distance in terms of experience and values.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

As the vehicle exits on a highway ramp, the car is seen to spin and its tires can be heard screeching. The driver then drops the camera and the car rolls over at it crashes.

The driver, Kenneth Hofler, 23, of Middletown, Connecticut, was driving over the Gold Star Memorial Bridge on Saturday when the incident took place. An officer was following him at the time of the crash, ABC News affiliate WABC reported.

The posted speed limit for the Gold Star Memorial Bridge is 55 mph.

Hofler was detained and taken to Lawrence and Memorial Hospital with minor injuries, police said.

At the time of the crash, Hofler was free on a $35,000 bond from an October arrest and in possession of more than one ounce of marijuana, according to the Associated Press.

He has been summonsed for violations including reckless driving and driving on a suspended license and possession of marijuana.

27957,bb2e505537c3b496e11b05485ea5fe30,"Ending Donald Trump's presidency is important, but the task also includes launching the era that must come next, tackling urgent crises in our nation.

A decade ago, I came to Iowa knocking doors for a young presidential candidate with a funny name. The stakes were high in that election. They are enormous now.

Traveling throughout Iowa this year, I’ve met workers facing rising costs and stagnant wages. Farmers are paying the price of a reckless trade war. Our children are learning active shooter drills before they learn to read.

Iowans cannot afford four more years of this president or the division that he exploits. On the morning after this president leaves office, the sun will come up on a country even more bitterly divided than we are now, exhausted from fighting — and still facing urgent crises.

This election will decide whether the next president will mobilize Americans behind bold ideas or polarize them around the same Washington fights that have held us back for decades. We need to elect a president who can not only end the era of Donald Trump, but can launch the era that must come next. I’m running for president to lead a nation done with division and hungry for action.

IOWA CAUCUSES:More commentary, the latest news stories, and candidate schedules

I’ve seen that hunger on display throughout Iowa.

I’ve seen it in the Des Moines mother who wrote me that her medical bills had become so expensive that she and her parents sold their homes to pay for her 24-hour care. That’s why I’ve proposed Medicare for All Who Want It, which guarantees every American affordable coverage while letting you choose which plan is best for you, and introduced Long-Term Care America to ensure all Americans are supported. I measure the power of an idea not by how much controversy it generates, but by how many people it can help.

In a sweltering barn in Shenandoah, I met a young man who wanted to know how agriculture in the Midwest could help lead the fight against climate change. “People tend to forget about us,” he said. I told him how we’d put rural communities like his at the center of a national project and achieve a net-zero carbon economy by 2050.

During a Fourth of July parade in Storm Lake, I marched alongside 24 floats proudly displaying the two dozen countries that made up the area’s immigrant population. Places like Storm Lake inspired my plan for community renewal visas to attract immigrants to areas experiencing population decline, and strengthen my faith that we can manage our border in accordance with our values and our laws.

And I’ve seen that spirit in a teenager from Muscatine who found the courage to be open about her autism after watching our campaign lead with values of inclusion and belonging.

It may seem out of place, to emphasize unity and belonging at a time like this. But my sense of hope is based not in my age but in my experience.

In the dust of a war zone, I saw fellow Americans who had nothing in common besides the flag on our shoulders learn to trust each other with our lives. Amid the ruins of old factories, I saw my hometown answer those who called us a “dying city” by rising up and forging a new future. One afternoon in South Bend, I walked into my church, having once believed that something inside would make me forever an outsider — and walked out a married man. And in some of the most conservative counties in Iowa, and in more than 20 counties I’ve visited that voted for Barack Obama and then Donald Trump, I’ve witnessed the makings of an American majority made up of progressives, moderates, and even what I like to call “future former Republicans” sickened by the actions of this president, ready for something better.

What I’ve seen in Iowa has made me a better candidate, and it will make me a better president. There’s still plenty of work to be done before the caucus on Feb. 3. But I am forever grateful to have been welcomed into your communities. Propelled by your stories and your support, we can change the trajectory of our nation and usher in that era that must come next.

Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic candidate for president.

“From his service in Vietnam, to leading our Corps through the Beirut bombing aftermath, Gen. Kelley served with honor and distinction,” said Gen. David Berger, commandant of the Marine Corps.

Kelley, a Life Member of MOAA, was truly ""a Marine's Marine,” said MOAA Board Member Lt. Gen. Edward Hanlon, Jr., USMC (Ret).

“He looked, spoke, acted, fought, and lived his life as a Marine,” Hanlon said. “When he entered a room, you felt his charismatic presence. I suspect a generation of Marines, myself included, saw him as the ultimate role model. His career was wide-ranging and impactful.”

Kelley commissioned into the Marine Corps in 1950 after graduating from Villanova University. He served 37 years in the Marine Corps, including assignments commanding reconnaissance Marines, serving as the exchange officer with the British Royal Marines, and working as the Combat Intelligence Officer for the 3rd Marine Amphibious Force during his first tour in Vietnam.

He then took command of 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, earning a Silver Star Medal, Legion of Merit with Combat ""V"" and two awards of the Bronze Star Medal with Combat ""V"" during his time with the unit.

Kelley returned to the U.S. and attended the Air War College at Maxwell AFB, Ala. He was assigned to Headquarters Marine Corps and worked as the military assistant to the assistant commandant.

Kelley then returned to Vietnam, where he commanded the 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, the last Marine ground combat unit to leave Vietnam. During his second tour, Kelley was awarded a second Legion of Merit with Combat “V.”

Our 28th Commandant, General P.X. Kelley, passed away yesterday. We should honor Gen Kelley’s lifetime of service to the Corps and to the nation.

Berger (@CMC_MarineCorps) December 30, 2019

Over the next 10 years, Kelley earned promotions and served in leadership positions shaping plans, policy, and programs. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter promoted Kelley to lieutenant general and appointed him as the first commander of the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force, the four-service force now known as U.S. Central Command.

Kelley was serving as the 28th commandant of the Marine Corps in 1983 when a car bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut killed 241 Marines, sailors, and soldiers.

The attack took only six seconds from the time a 5-ton truck carrying 5,000 pounds of explosives left an adjacent parking lot until it slammed into the building, Kelley told the Senate Armed Services Committee. It remains the single deadliest attack on Americans on foreign soil.

Kelley, who served as commandant from 1983 until his retirement in 1987, welcomed home survivors of the attack at Camp Lejeune, N.C.

“When I met the first flight of your fallen comrades as they arrived at Dover, Delaware, after the mass murder of Oct. 23, I asked the question, Lord, where do we get such men?” Kelley said at Camp Lejeune. “As you stand here today I ask the same question.

The simple answer is that we get them from every clime and place, from every race, from every creed, and from every color.”", Carry out car bombing,3

Three teenagers have been found guilty of killing an Uber Eats delivery driver as he tried to stop his scooter being stolen.

Iderval Da Silva, 46, was set upon with ""fists and feet"" in Battersea, west London, in May last year.

He was punched and kicked by youths and left unconscious on the ground.

Mr Da Silva died three days later from a bleed on the brain.

Following an Old Bailey trial, a 16-year-old boy and 19-year-old Jadan Richards, from Wandsworth, were found guilty of murder.

A youth aged 17 was found guilty of manslaughter but cleared of murder.

Prosecutor Tony Badenoch QC had told the trial how Brazilian Mr da Silva had parked his scooter outside a Battersea cafe on May 25 last year.

A group of young men spotted the unattended moped and one of them made to snatch it, he said.

When Mr Da Silva tried to stop him, he was set upon with ""fists and feet"".

Mr Badenoch told jurors: ""It was a momentary explosion of short-lived violence which killed Mr Da Silva.""

Jasire Frazer, 18, from Wandsworth, and a 17-year-old were cleared of murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter.

Another 17-year-old boy was cleared on the judge's direction midway through the trial.

Judge Mark Dennis QC adjourned sentencing until February 5.

In normal times, Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh area would easily fall off the map: A dingy, congested locality with open drains and dangerously dangling power cable lines. But these are not normal times in the overcrowded areas that surround Jamia Nagar, the epicentre of anti-Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) protests in the national capital. Which is why the otherwise nondescript Shaheen Bagh has suddenly found a voice that resonates far and wide. Every day, round the clock, braving the severe winter cold, large groups of women sit in protest here on the street. Raising slogans, chanting songs, seeking justice, shattering every stereotype. Not a stone has been thrown here in anger even though the rage is palpable. The fury is as much against the Delhi police who entered the Jamia library and targeted students as it is against the Narendra Modi government which, they are convinced, is “anti-Muslim” in intent.

Few of those gathered seem to have read the fine print of the new law, but insist that the legislation is “draconian”. “Bharosa nahi hai (we don’t trust)”, when I remind them of the prime minister and home minister’s repeated promises that no Indian Muslim would be affected by the CAA and their claim that the National Register of Citizens has not even been discussed. Clearly, this is a battle of perception as much as of the legislative minutiae, a conviction in the minds of the protestors that the Modi government has a discriminatory, majoritarian mindset.

“But aren’t you all also benefitting from government schemes like Ujwala, Mudra Yojna or an Ayushman Bharat, where is the Hindu-Muslim narrative in that?” I ask. “This is only for votes at election time, do you really think that the prime minister treats us as equal citizens, unke sarkar ke liye hum sab aantakwadi hain, (we are all terrorists for his government)!” an elderly woman hits back. Remember Shaheen Bagh is not too far from Batla House, another Muslim-dominated zone in the neighbourhood that shot into public imagination after a terror encounter here in 2008.

I persist with my line of questioning, and ask them about the incidents of violence that have taken place in Jamia and parts of Uttar Pradesh during the anti CAA-NRC protests: Buses burnt, public property damaged, firearms being used. “You TV persons keep showing images of a burning bus, we give roses and water to the police here,” a young woman in a bright salwar-kameez responds. TV news is the new “enemy”, the so-called “godi [pliant] media” seen as a surrogate of an autocratic State machinery.

A WhatsApp video of a senior police officer from Meerut telling protestors to “go to Pakistan” has gone viral. Amoral technology cuts through religious boundaries, and every incendiary video only adds to the sense of being encircled and persecuted by the “other”. “Would any policeman speak like this to any Jat or Gujjar protestor, why should wearing a skull cap and a beard, or a burqa or hijab lead to our patriotism being questioned?” says an infuriated lady. I mumble something incoherently about how not every police officer is communal-minded, only to be cornered again by another livid voice: “Forget policemen, there are ministers in this government who keep telling Muslims to go to Pakistan!” (the reference I presume is to Giriraj Singh, a serial offender in this regard).

This isn’t the only video that has gone viral in a highly surcharged atmosphere. I point to a video of Amanatullah Khan, the local Aam Aadmi Party Member of Legislative Assembly, making a provocative speech where he warns the crowd that its getting difficult for Muslims to breathe and live with freedom. “Is this not a brazenly communal speech, why don’t you call him out?” I ask. The response is just as combative: “Look, Amanatullah is our leader here, if he takes up our cause, what’s wrong with it? Don’t Amit Shah and Yogi make similar speeches, didn’t the PM make a shamshan-qabristan speech?”

The argumentative interaction continues for almost an hour. Its getting darker and colder, but the crowd isn’t melting away just yet. Some women have brought blankets, and are planning to spend the night under the icy skies. I am preparing to leave when one of them gets in a last word: “Next time, please call us to the studio instead of the maulvis that you always do!”

Maybe I really should. Maybe our VIP ministers too should meet and listen to Shaheen Bagh’s women, and step out of their self-comforting echo chambers of privilege. Trapped between victimhood and rage, these are voices that are both revealing and scary. They reveal the volcanic lava that is bubbling under the surface of increasingly fragile communal relations, threatening to erupt at the slightest trigger point. The divisive CAA-NRC debate has been one such trigger that has only further polarised the fault lines within an already fragmented society. And yes, brought the incensed women of Shaheen Bagh onto the streets.

Post-script: As I get into my car, and switch the heater on, I gaze at the potholed roads, hanging power cable lines, crazily crowded by-lanes. I wonder when we will see urban protests break out over lack of jobs and crumbling infrastructure. Or, will the toxic narrative of “muscular” Hindutva and aggressive Islamism remain the overriding messaging, one that is ominous for society, but perhaps politically convenient for the leadership of both communities?

28148,b89d871d94a4fbe7f86e7ec6039d0d38,"Right Opinion Iran Officials Must Face Justice for Crimes Against Humanity

Iran unleashed its proxies in Iraq to attack the U.S. embassy in Baghdad on the last day of 2019. That speaks volumes about the nature of Tehran rulers. President Trump correctly held them accountable. The ayatollahs’ conduct at home and abroad has been utterly malign. Period. They stand out as one of the most pressing challenges the international community faces as we enter 2020.

In November, major protests broke out in Iran. The regime’s response was unprecedentedly brutal. International rights group Amnesty International condemned “the frequency and persistence of lethal force” deployed against peaceful demonstrations. Astonishingly, the death toll has now surpassed 1,500. Over 4,000 have been injured, and more than 12,000 are in prisons and at risk of torture. Some reports have indicated that a number of detained protesters have already been tortured or killed. Yet, the world community is not holding the regime’s officials accountable for these crimes against humanity.

There are harrowing accounts. In the city of Mahshahr, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) arrived with tanks and armored vehicles. After unarmed protesters came under fire and fled into a nearby marsh, the IRGC surrounded them and used truck-mounted machine guns to massacre as many as 100 people.

In other cities, IRGC agents fired into crowds from the roofs of government buildings. And videos show IRGC and other security forces shooting some fleeing protesters in the back. The UN’s top human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, said last Friday that the forces in question were unmistakably “shooting to kill.”

What makes the entire episode more chilling is that the Iranian regime cut off all Internet access for roughly the first week of demonstrations. It clearly had the intent of massacring as many people as possible to prevent the spread of protests.

The leading opposition group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), was the most active movement on the ground in Iran. In addition to sending out videos and credible news, its “Resistance Units” also led and guided the protests. On Dec. 15, it said that 1,500 protesters had been killed. Since then, various news agencies and U.S. State Department officials have cited the MEK’s reported figures as their sources.

After the resumption of Internet access, in just a few days, upwards of 20,000 messages reached the U.S. State Department, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The MEK, along with its parent coalition the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), has also emphasized that the protests are not over. Some regime officials have acknowledged that arrests are still being made, while “leaders” of the uprising are still being identified.

The NCRI says thousands of detained protesters are under excruciating conditions. The regime’s suppressive forces have reportedly transferred many of the wounded out of hospitals and placed them under torture. Many of the detainees, including those in Shiraz, are being pressured to take part in televised “confessions” and speak out against the uprising and the MEK. Amnesty International has called for those arbitrarily arrested to be released.

Suppression is now virtually the only factor forestalling the mullahs’ overthrow. Regardless of whether Western policymakers think it is worthwhile to put pressure on Tehran or support the change of this regime by the Iranian people, there should be no question about their responsibility to halt a massacre if they are able to do so. When it comes to defending the Iranian protesters and defending them against the ayatollahs’ brutality, Europe should stand shoulder to shoulder with the U.S.

Some governments may think they have dodged this responsibility simply by waiting out the unrest. They must be reminded that both the protests and the regime’s crackdowns are far from over. And even if the nationwide uprising were brought to heel, it wouldn’t mean that the participants in that uprising were suddenly safe. Iran’s jails are already overcapacity, and the regime has threatened to execute those deemed responsible for the unrest. It’s a safe bet that as soon as the world’s attention is focused elsewhere, Tehran will make good on that promise.

This is why the international community must offer a permanent response to the present situation. As Iranian opposition leader Maryam Rajavi has urged, the world community should demand that the regime grant free access to the country for UN human-rights experts and other monitors who are committed to safeguarding the rights of protesters throughout the world. The U.S. can play a leading role to this effect.

Until the international community can effectively guarantee that Tehran’s repressive policies are a thing of the past, no free, democratic nation should willingly engage in trade or diplomatic exchanges with Iran. The regime cannot refuse this ultimatum without affirming its intent to continue murdering its own people.

It is an affront to humanity and a serious shirking of moral responsibility for the international community to remain silent in the face of the crimes being committed against humanity in Iran. The UN must act now to send a fact-finding mission to Tehran to investigate the regime’s crimes. Tehran’s leaders must face justice, lest more crimes against humanity continue unabated.", Accuse of aggression,3

ALLAHABAD: There were more than 1,200 incidents of fire in the city in 2019 and most of these were triggered by short circuits at homes, hotels and shops. Cooking gas leak was the second major cause of fires that reduced property worth crores to ashes.According to fire department statistics, around 67% incidents were caused by electrical short circuits, including the four infernos at Nehru Complex Kutchery Road godown, Dhoomanganj godown and Naini godown . Another 18% is attributed to LPG mishaps at homes and restaurants. While four persons lost their lives in these incidents, firemen managed to save 18.The highest number of fire mishaps at 338 were recorded in May followed by 307 in April, 157 in June, 88 in March, 52 in January, 51 in November, 43 in February, 42 in July, 41 in October, 31 in December , 26 in August and 25 in September.Confirming the figures, chief fire officer (Allahabad) RS Mishra indicated that overworked home appliances were behind several fires that took place during the night. Short circuits occur when a low-resistance path not suited to carry electricity receives a high volume of current, the result being appliance damage, electrical shock or a fire.“To prevent electrical fires at homes, the department has launched a campaign to educate people about the dos and don’ts. While periodically checking appliances for loose connections is necessary, people must also keep fire extinguishers up to date. Commercial establishments must adopt same precautions,” Mishra said, pushing for regular monitoring of LPG connections as well.A detailed advisory has been issued to industrial units, warehouses, godowns and residential colonies, and surprise inspections are on the cards. “The department is also checking the status of fire-fighting equipment at multi-storey buildings, including government offices,” the chief fire officer said. “All district hospitals will shortly be equipped with advanced fire-fighting systems,” he added.A special drive is being planned to decongest old city lanes and fix dangling wires."," Threaten, not specified below",3

An insider told US Weekly that Kate and Prince William's three youngster's 'adore' Prince Harry, 35, and 38-year-old Meghan Markle's seven-month-old son, Archie.

It comes as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spent their first Christmas as a family with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland in Vancouver Island, Canada.

28430,410855b7576b83ef0d153e39924934a2,"Harvey Weinstein will get out of a black SUV in lower Manhattan on Monday and walk into a media gauntlet. More than 150 journalists have obtained credentials to cover his rape trial, making for one of the biggest spectacles in memory.

On the 15th floor, Weinstein will take a seat in the courtroom of Justice James Burke, a former prosecutor who has denied motion after motion from a rotating cast of Weinstein defense lawyers to dismiss counts or exclude witnesses. Many of the more than 80 women who have accused Weinstein of sexual assault will be seated in the audience behind him. A few will be instantly recognizable — many more will not. Some will have been waiting decades for this moment.

Once the trial gets underway, his defense hopes to find jurors who will keep an open mind and can see their way to reasonable doubt. Even a hung jury would be a victory, and many defense lawyers who are following the case believe that outcome is within reach.

“I think this is going to be a very, very difficult case for the prosecution to win,” says Jeffery Greco, a criminal defense attorney who practices in New York and Los Angeles. “A lot of jurors are going to look at him and say, ‘I don’t doubt that what he did was morally wrong and reprehensible, but I don’t know that it was against their will.’ If that’s not believed beyond a reasonable doubt, they’re going to walk him.”

The jury will hear from six accusers, but the case will rest largely on the credibility of just two of them. Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant on a Weinstein Co. show, alleges that the producer forcibly performed oral sex on her at his Soho home in 2006. The second woman, who remains unidentified, alleges that he raped her in a hotel room in 2013.

In addition to the two primary accusers, Weinstein will face four other witnesses, including “Sopranos” actor Annabella Sciorra, who have their own allegations against him. Sciorra alleges that Weinstein raped her in 1993 or 1994.

In pretrial motions, Weinstein’s then-attorney argued that Haleyi and the unidentified accuser maintained friendly relations with Weinstein long after the alleged assaults. The attorney, Benjamin Brafman, disclosed emails in which both women sought Weinstein’s help in landing jobs.

“Each woman who accuses the defendant of sexual assault increases exponentially the difficulty of defending the allegations in the indictment.”

Daniel Hochheiser, New York defense attorney

“I appreciate all you do for me, it shows,” the unidentified accuser wrote to Weinstein less than a month after the alleged rape, according to one of Brafman’s filings. Such exchanges went on for years, he alleged.

In 2017, the accuser allegedly wrote, “I love you, always do. But I hate feeling like a booty call.”

Brafman said his investigators had also talked to a close friend of the accuser who would testify that the accuser and Weinstein were in a consensual relationship. He said the friend recalled going with the accuser to a Weinstein Co. test screening just hours after the alleged rape, where both met with Weinstein. According to Brafman, the accuser didn’t mention the rape to her friend until years later, when she allegedly tried to enlist the friend in pursuing charges.

If jurors decide not to believe either of the two women, Weinstein will be acquitted. The challenge is getting jurors to tune everything else out.

“No matter what you know about him, he’s only charged with crimes related to these two women,” says Julie Rendelman, a defense attorney and former Brooklyn prosecutor. “If the jury focuses only on that, the prosecutor does have problems with their case.”

Weinstein’s lead lawyer, Donna Rotunno, specializes in sex crimes cases, and has built a reputation in Chicago for meticulous cross-examination of accusers. In interviews, she has pushed back on aspects of the #MeToo movement.

“My biggest issue is this notion that because women make a claim it must be true,” she tells Variety. “This notion that cross-examination is victim shaming … is obscene. Any claim has a right under our system of justice to be questioned and cross-examined. That doesn’t mean we’re horrible people. But I have a right to do my job.”

In addition to Sciorra, three other corroborating accusers — who have not yet been identified — will testify about incidents in 2004, 2005 and 2013. Their testimony will be used to buttress the main witnesses’ accounts, in much the way that Bill Cosby was tried and convicted in 2018.

Little is known about the supporting witnesses’ accounts, but their presence will make the defense’s job substantially harder.

“Each woman who accuses the defendant of sexual assault increases exponentially the difficulty of defending the allegations in the indictment,” says Daniel Hochheiser, a New York defense attorney. “A good defense lawyer can challenge the credibility of one complainant, two complainants. Once you get to three, four, five, it gets to the point you need a magician instead of a lawyer.”

The defense has indicated that it may try to go after the NYPD for alleged misconduct. The lead investigator, Det. Nicholas DiGaudio, was removed from the case after allegedly withholding exculpatory evidence from prosecutors.

The prosecution is not likely to call DiGaudio to the stand, and is instead expected to rely on the D.A.’s own investigators. The defense could call DiGaudio as its own witness, though it is unclear how far Burke would allow the defense to go. In November, the judge denied a defense request to obtain DiGaudio’s personnel file.

Rotunno and co-counsel Arthur Aidala could also call Weinstein to testify, though that would be a high-risk strategy. The defense is not expected to make a final decision on that until the trial is underway.

The other key strategic moment will be jury selection. The court is expected to call hundreds of prospective jurors, in hopes of finding people with lots of free time who know relatively little about the case. Jurors will be given a lengthy questionnaire in an effort to flag potential issues. For each panel of about 20 jurors, the prosecution and the defense will have about 15 minutes for questioning. The defense will aim to use that time to weed out people who seem ill disposed toward its client. It will be an uphill battle.

“He’ll come into the courtroom with a black mark on him. He’s already been vilified,” says Bennett Gershman, a law professor at Pace University and a former Manhattan prosecutor. “It’s an incredibly difficult challenge for the defense to overcome the public feeling — the venom that people feel about his conduct.”", Sexually assault,3
28469,83b120858a86bedadb99246a9694f2fd,"OTTAWA — The Trudeau government has long characterized it as a dispassionate policy exercise drawing on expert evidence.

But the political drumbeats are growing louder — at home and abroad — as the federal Liberals come closer to deciding whether to let a Chinese telecom firm help build Canada's next-generation mobile networks.

The development of 5G, or fifth-generation, networks will give people speedier connections and provide vast data capacity to meet the ceaseless demand for emerging applications, like virtual reality and autonomous driving, as more and more things link to the internet.

In Canada, China-based Huawei Technologies, Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are among the leading candidates to help telecommunication firms such as BCE and Telus build their 5G networks.

The opposition Conservatives are pressing the Liberals to deny Huawei a role in assembling the country's 5G infrastructure, alleging it will allow Beijing to spy on Canadians more easily.

Some security experts say Huawei's participation could give it access to an array of digital data gleaned from how, when and where Canadian customers use their electronic devices. In turn, the theory goes, Chinese security agencies could pressure the company into handing over the personal information.

Such fears stem from the fact China's National Intelligence Law plainly states that Chinese organizations and citizens shall support, assist and co-operate with state intelligence work.

At a forum in Halifax last November, Donald Trump's national security adviser urged Ottawa to bar Huawei from 5G efforts because the technology would be used as a ""Trojan horse"" to undermine Canada.

The warning came a day after China's ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, dismissed the notion Huawei could compromise users' security by installing ""back-door"" channels in equipment, calling it a ""groundless accusation.""

Huawei emphasizes it is not a state-controlled enterprise and that it would never do the bidding of spymasters from China or any other country.

Benjamin Howes, a Huawei Canada vice-president for international media affairs, notes the company's involvement in Canada's existing 4G networks has never led to any such security incident.

He points to Huawei's $650-million investment in research and development in Canada since 2009, with major labs in Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, Ont., Montreal and Vancouver, as well as plans for one in Quebec City.

""In every country where we have a business presence, we're committed to complying with the applicable laws and regulations, and Canada is no different,"" Howes said. ""So we will continue to be compliant, as we have been over the decade that we've been here, with Canadian laws and regulations.""

Ottawa is carrying out a comprehensive review of Huawei's potential role in 5G that includes a broader, strategic look at how the technology can foster economic growth.

Given the scope of the review, several agencies — namely Public Safety Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Communications Security Establishment, Global Affairs, and Innovation, Science and Economic Development — are taking part.

""We will ensure that our networks are kept secure and will take the appropriate decisions in due course,"" said Scott Bardsley, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.

The government has been tight-lipped about the exercise, but the results are expected relatively soon.

""We respect the process, and we just hope that it's going to be based on technology and security, not politics,"" Howes said.

However, the public debate has already been tinged by political developments.

Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei executive, in December 2018 at the request of the United States, where she is wanted over allegations of violating sanctions on Iran. Her extradition case is before a Canadian court.

The move angered Beijing, and two Canadians working in China were arrested soon after on vague allegations of endangering national security — a move widely seen as retaliation against Ottawa.

The U.S. and Australia, key intelligence allies of Canada, have already taken steps to curb Huawei's participation in 5G networks.

In the House of Commons, the Conservatives have persistently needled the Trudeau government over the issue.

""When will the Liberals ban Huawei?"" Conservative MP Steven Blaney asked Blair during a recent question period.

""Would they rather see Canadians' personal information in the hands of the Chinese?""

Blair's answer underscored the fact the government has long had a security-review program in place to manage cybersecurity risks that might stem from new equipment and services.

""We will continue to work with telecommunication service providers and the vendors through this collaborative program to mitigate the security concerns,"" Blair said. ""We will examine all security, economic and global considerations when making this determination.""

Canada will be watching closely for Britain's coming decision on Huawei's participation in its 5G projects. If Boris Johnson's new government adopts the Australian and U.S. line, it could be more politically challenging for Canada to embrace Huawei.

Ottawa's examination of 5G technology and the associated security and economic dimensions will include ""the careful consideration of our allies' advice,"" Bardsley said.

For its part, Huawei insists it will remain committed to Canada, no matter how the 5G microchips fall.

""Regardless of the decision, our position is we will continue to serve our customers in Canada with our products and networks,"" Howes said. ""And we will continue to enhance our investments in R and D.""

28479,f57b92d62e5f7b707bb3037f68191eb4,"For more than two centuries, Christianity suffered under the Roman Empire. Christians were arrested, tortured, mutilated, burned, and starved. Christian buildings and the homes of Christians were torn down and their sacred books burned. The religious persecutions came to an end when Emperor Constantine ascended the throne. Unlike his predecessors, the emperor was a great patron of the Church. He built an extraordinary number of basilicas around the length and breadth of the empire, granted privileges to clergy, endowed the church with land and wealth, and even returned property confiscated from Christians by earlier rulers.

Battle of the Milvian Bridge by Giulio Romano, 1520-24.

What made Emperor Constantine convert to Christianity has been debated and discussed by theologians and historians for centuries. It is possible that Constantine's mother exposed him to Christianity from an early age. But many historians believe that Constantine experienced a dramatic event in 312 just before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge began, on the banks of Tiber on the outskirts of modern-day Rome, leaving a profound effect on the future emperor.

Eusebius, one of the Christian Church's early historians, describes a vision that Constantine had while marching towards the site of the battle:

...while he was thus praying with fervent entreaty, a most marvelous sign appeared to him from heaven, the account of which it might have been hard to believe had it been related by any other person. ...about noon, when the day was already beginning to decline, he saw with his own eyes the trophy of a cross of light in the heavens, above the Sun, and bearing the inscription 'conquer by this'. At this sight he himself was struck with amazement, and his whole army also, which followed him on this expedition, and witnessed the miracle.

At first Constantine was unsure of the meaning of the apparition, but the following night he had a dream in which Christ explained to him that he should use the sign against his enemies. Constantine then commanded his troops to adorn their shields with the Christian symbol, the Chi-Rho, which he had seen in the skies. Constantine's army won the battle, and the new emperor dedicated the victory to Christ whom he believed had helped him.

But what was the celestial event that had such a transforming effect on Constantine?

Geologists believe Constantine had witnessed a meteorite impact, and the crater the impact had left behind is still out there in central Italy. The Sirente crater, located in the highlands north of the Sirente massif, is small and circular, and although there have been a lot of theories about its formation, Swedish geologist Jens Ormö believes it’s an impact crater.

“Its shape fits and it is also surrounded by numerous smaller, secondary craters, gouged out by ejected debris, as expected from impact models,” Ormö explains.

Image credit: visitabruzzo.altervista.org

Radiocarbon dating puts the crater's formation at about the same time Constantine had his celestial vision. An impact generating a crater the size of one at Sirente would have been visible from a great distance. Before it hit, the meteorite would have blazed across the sky in a large fireball mesmerizing Constantine and his troops. It would have struck earth with the force of a small nuclear bomb, about one kiloton in yield.

The age of the crater also corresponds to local history. A nearby village was suddenly abandoned possibly because of fire during the 4th century. Catacombs dating to the same period reveal many bodies interred in a hasty manner. A local legend, passed orally, also provides a vivid description of the cataclysmic event. One version of the legend goes thus:

And then, an uproar hit the mountain and quartered the giant oaks announcing the violent arrival of the Goddess. A sudden and intense heat overwhelmed the people and a shout echoed all around, splitting the air with its trail of violence. All of a sudden, over there, in the distance, in the sky, a new star, never seen before, bigger than the other ones, came nearer and nearer, appeared and disappeared behind the top of the eastern mountains. …Soon the star shone as large as a new sun. An irresistible, dazzling light pervaded the sky. The oak-leaves shuddered, discolored, curled up. The forest lost its sap.

The close spacing in both time and geography between the Milvian Bridge and the Sirente impact site have led researchers to reexamine the historic events. According to one study, Constantine and his military forces were camped only 100 km from the impact site before the battle of the Milvian Bridge. This must have given them a clear view of the mushroom cloud that would have likely arose following the impact, deeply influencing him and turning the tide of the conflict and the course of Christianity.

Two of the women are said to have been raped and the third reportedly fought off her attacker as he tried to force himself on her although she is said to have been physically attacked as she did so.

Police in the city of Murcia in south east Spain, where the incident occurred, have confirmed they are investigating a complaint made by three women.

'We cannot say any more because the investigation is ongoing.'

He declined to specify the nature of the complaint.

Local press said the three women, described as sisters from the US aged 23, 20, and 18, had told investigators they were targeted after going back to the home of one of the women with three men they had met in a pub on New Year's Eve.

Respected daily La Opinion de Murcia said two of the women had been visiting a third sister who had been studying in the city and was about to return to the States.

Two of the women are said to have been raped at the flat. The third woman, thought to be the teenager, was reportedly injured after being assaulted as she resisted.

No arrests have yet taken place. Spanish state RTVE has described the men the three women say sexually attacked them as Iranian.

All three women have been examined in hospital by a medical practitioner.

At the end of September a Spanish teenager told police she had been raped in the toilets of a nightclub in Valencia.

Two suspects were arrested but later released after DNA tests showed they had taken no part in the suspected sexual attack.

Two of the women are said to have been raped and the third reportedly fought off her attacker as he tried to force himself on her although she is said to have been physically attacked as she did so. Pictured is the area in Murcia where the rapes allegedly happened

At the start of the same month a French tourist told police police she had been raped in the holiday resort of Platja d'Aro near Girona in north-east Spain.

The 27-year-old said she was sexually attacked after being abducted by three men outside a nightclub.

The gang rape is said to have taken place on the resort's main beach, known as Platja Gran, around 6am on September 1.

No arrests are yet believed to have taken place.

In August five French men aged 18 and 19 were arrested on suspicion of gang-raping a Norwegian tourist at a house in Benidorm and indecently assaulting her friend.

Three of the five detainees were remanded in custody after appearing before a judge in a closed court hearing.

The French holidaymakers arranged to meet the two Norwegians over social dating site Tinder.

In July four Germans of Turkish origin were arrested on suspicion of gang-raping an 18-year-old German in the Majorcan holiday resort of Cala Rajada.

The holiday nightmare was far from over for Lisa, however.

She told Express.co.uk: “We spent the day with the police, after being attacked in the early hours of the morning. Later I went to the mall to buy a cheap phone. Then we went to sleep and got some rest.”

Waking up on Sunday morning, the day they were flying to their next location Puerto Escondido, Lisa discovered she had been emailed the previous evening by the hotel cancelling their booking. Panicked, she contacted Booking.com.

“The next morning when I checked the phone saw the email, I spoke to (Booking.com) and said ‘That’s not funny, I’m about to fly over.’”

Lisa explained about the circumstances of the attack she and her partner had endured, and their lack of personal items, plus the fact they were in an area with a poor wifi signal and about to fly.

Lisa said: “She just kept saying, ‘I can’t escalate the call’.”

Lisa was put on hold, and eventually the call was hung up.

“They then emailed and said we found you accommodation,” Lisa explained.

“They found somewhere next door, but they told us there was no other accommodation in the town because it’s New Years. Plus, they told us it’s the busiest New Years they’ve ever seen there.”

28636,ab1f723e93944e724b344b6f6d0b8e3c,"PORTLAND, Maine — Their catch this year has plummeted, while their exports to China have been gutted by the trade war. The government has imposed strict quotas on their primary bait. And they’re facing serious lawsuits that could affect how they fish.

© Robert F. Bukaty A lobster boat headed out to fish at Cape Porpoise in Kennebunkport, Maine in August.

Now, the region’s lobstermen are facing a new, imminent threat, one that could drastically change how they’ve operated for generations: regulations to protect North Atlantic right whales.

With a population that has dwindled by 20 percent over the past decade to about 400, the critically endangered species is at risk of extinction, largely because of hundreds of thousands of buoy lines that extend from the surface to the seafloor in the Gulf of Maine.

As a result, federal regulators are considering rules that could cut as many as half those lines, the leading cause of right whale deaths.

But lobstermen here say such limits could devastate an industry that contributes an estimated $1.5 billion to the state’s economy, and their opposition has been building for months, with the support of their state’s leaders.

“My administration will not allow any bureaucrat to undermine our lobster industry or our economy with foolish, unsupported, and ill-advised regulations,” Governor Janet Mills told a crowd of cheering lobstermen at a protest last summer in Stonington. “I will do everything to protect your rights and livelihoods and defend Maine’s lobster industry in the face of this absurd federal overreach.”

The backlash started shortly after a government-appointed team of scientists, fishermen, and others urged the agency to require lobstermen to reduce their buoy lines, among other measures.

Initially, representatives of lobstermen and state officials in Maine voted to approve the team’s controversial recommendations, a compromise with environmental groups that scientists estimated would reduce the risk of death and serious injury to the whales by roughly 60 percent.

But with increasingly vocal protests across Maine’s rugged coast from rank-and-file lobstermen, the state’s leaders — including the entire congressional delegation — reversed the state’s position and opposed the recommendations made by the Atlantic Whale Take Reduction Team, even writing to President Trump to ask for his intervention to block the rules.

More recently, state officials have countered the federal proposal with one of their own, which would instead reduce buoy lines by about 25 percent.

Maine’s plan would require lobstermen to use weaker rope that could break during an entanglement, increase the number of traps per buoy line for many lobstermen, and mandate specially colored rope that indicates the lines are from Maine. It would also require lobstermen to file monthly reports on where they fish, and how many traps they used.

“This is our line in the sand,” Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told lobstermen at a meeting in Portland in December. “If they don’t accept this, I’m sure we’re going to be in a federal court, fighting this out.”

But environmental advocates argue that Maine’s counterproposal is woefully inadequate, noting that federal scientists have said that the species can’t survive the unnatural death of more than one whale a year.

“It’s disappointing that Maine has continued to backtrack,” said Erica Fuller, a senior staff attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston-based advocacy group that has sued the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to do more to protect right whales. “We are in the midst of an extinction crisis, and the agency cannot let politics and money get in the way of saving this iconic species.”

The only sure way to reduce the risk, she and other advocates say, is to allow far fewer buoy lines or expand fishing closures, as the federal government already does for several months a year in Cape Cod Bay.

“NOAA cannot allow any more blind management decisions to contribute to the alarming decline of right whales,” said Fuller, adding that Maine officials have “politicized the scientific process and made gratuitous recommendations.”

But lobstermen, who have seen this year’s catch fall by as much as 40 percent and have been coping with a 70 percent cut to quotas for herring, their primary bait, argue that the real fault lies with Canada.

In a letter to NOAA last month, Maine’s congressional delegation accused the agency of perpetuating “the unsubstantiated narrative that the Maine lobster fishery is the primary cause of right whale serious injury and mortality.”

In recent years, as the Gulf of Maine has warmed and the right whale’s primary food source has declined and moved farther north, the lawmakers noted that more of the whales have died in Canadian waters than off the coast of New England. Of the 30 found dead since 2017, 21 died in Canada.

“Continuing to downplay the role of Canadian fisheries in future right whale management plans ignores the reality that the species is not bound by national borders,” they wrote. “Lobster fishery management efforts cannot be successful unless the impacts from Canadian fisheries and shipping on right whale injury and mortality are adequately accounted for.”

Facing opposition on both sides, federal regulators say they’re searching for common ground.

A recent scientific evaluation of Maine’s proposal suggested it would protect whales only slightly less than the federal plan submitted in the spring, meaning Maine’s plan could be accepted, NOAA officials said.

“We are working on a solution that allows for right whales to recover, while lobster fishing continues to thrive,” said Jennifer Goebel, a spokeswoman for NOAA.

Michael Pentony, the regional administrator of NOAA, said he recognizes that Maine has “the most to lose” from the new regulations.

“We understand their frustrations,” he said in an interview.

He declined to comment on the agency’s plans but called the effort to save right whales “a moral obligation.”

“This is a monumental challenge we’re facing, and it requires everybody . . . our state partners, the fishing industry, environmental groups,” Pentony said. “We all need to come to the table and play a part in the recovery of this iconic species.”

NOAA officials had said the rules would likely be released this month, but they are now slated for March. NOAA officials recently announced that they plan to provide $1.6 million to help lobstermen and others comply with the protection measures.

At a recent conference on right whales in Portland, scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution presented a study suggesting that lobstermen can actually increase their profits by reducing their buoy lines.

Between 2007 and 2013, landings per trap in Maine increased by 124 percent, while the overall number of traps they fished fell by 10.5 percent, the study found. In 2018, Maine lobstermen caught 119 million pounds of lobster — more than double the catch in 2000.

The paper also found that while Maine lobstermen spent significantly more time fishing than their Canadian counterparts, the Canadians caught nearly four times as much as the Americans, suggesting the lobstermen across the border are more efficient.

“If fishermen end up taking gear out of the water to protect right whales, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the industry will suffer,” said Hannah Myers, one of the authors of the study. “In fact, they may earn more in the long term by making the fishery more efficient. The data show that this could be a genuine win-win scenario.”

Officials at the Maine Lobstermen’s Association didn’t respond to requests for comment about the study. But they oppose both the federal and state proposals to protect the whales.

That continued resistance, and the possibility that regulators could accept Maine’s plan, has led some environmental advocates to threaten legal action.

“The right whale has no time for half measures,” said Jane Davenport, a senior staff attorney at Defenders of Wildlife, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group that has already sued the federal government. If NOAA “runs out the clock rather than implementing the aggressive, full-court press strategy the law requires to save this species, it will answer to us in court.”

28675,bcaa5015b3704c77f94df5aa67e3dae2,"Customers of 3 MSPs Hit in Ransomware Attacks

Early information suggests threat actors gained access to remote monitoring and management tools from Webroot and Kaseya to distribute malware.

UPDATE: 06/21/2019 This story has been updated to reflect the fact that customers of at least three MSPs were impacted in the attacks, not just one MSP as previously reported.

Computers belonging to customers of at least three managed services providers have been hit with ransomware after attackers somehow gained access to tools used by the MSPs to remotely manage and monitor client systems.

Details of the attacks are still only emerging, and the full scope of the incidents or even the names of the MSPs are still not currently available. But early information suggests that attackers likely used two remote management tools at the MSPs — one from Webroot, the other from Kaseya — to distribute the ransomware. Both vendors have said the attackers appear to have used stolen credentials to access their tools at the MSP locations.

Comments on an MSP forum on Redditt, including from security researchers claiming close knowledge of the incidents, suggest one MSP is a large company and that many of its clients have been impacted.

A researcher from Huntress Labs, a firm that provides security services to MSPs, claimed on Reditt to have confirmation that the attackers used a remote management console from Webroot to execute a PowerShell based payload that in turn downloaded the ransomware on client systems. Webroot describes the console as allowing administrators to view and manage devices protected by the company's AV software.

According to the Huntress Labs researcher, the payload was likely 'Sodinokibi', a ransomware tool that encrypts data on infected systems and deletes shadow copy backups as well.

Kyle Hanslovan, CEO and co-founder of Huntress Lab says a customer of one MSP that was attacked, contacted his company Thursday and provided their Webroot management console logs for analysis. ""We don't know how the attacker gained access into the Webroot console,"" Hanslovan says.

But based on the timestamps, the Webroot console was used to download payloads onto all managed systems very quickly and possibly in an automated fashion. ""This affected customer had 67 computers targeted by malicious PowerShell delivered by Webroot,"" Hanslovan says. ""We're not sure how many computers were successfully encrypted by the ransomware.""

What's also not clear is how the attackers are managing to gain access to the Webroot console so efficiently he says. ""We’ve yet to see anything that would suggest the issue is a global Webroot vulnerabilty."" However, three MSP incidents in less than 48hrs involved compromised Webroot management console credentials, he notes.

One Reditt poster using the handle ""Jimmybgood22"" claimed Thursday afternoon that almost all of its systems were down. ""One of our clients getting hit with ransomware is a nightmare, but all of our clients getting hit at the same time is on another level completely,"" Jimmybgood22 wrote.

Huntress Labs posted a copy of an email that Webroot purportedly sent out to customers following the incident, informing them about two-factor authentication (2FA) now being enforced on the remote management portal. The email noted that threat actors who might have been ""thwarted with more consistent cyber hygiene"" had impacted a small number of Webroot customers. The company immediately began working with the customers to remediate any impact.

Effective early morning June 20, Webroot also initiated an automated console logoff and implemented mandatory 2FA in the Webroot Management Console, the security vendor said. Chad Bacher, sebior vice president of products at Webroot says the comapny's product has not been compronised. ""We all know that two-factor authentication (2FA) is a cyber hygiene best practice, and we’ve encouraged customers to use the Webroot Management Console’s built-in 2FA for some time,"" Bacher says.

Meanwhile, another researcher with UBX Cloud, a firm that provides triage and consulting services to MSPs, claimed on Reditt to have knowledge that the attacker had leveraged a remote monitoring and management tool from Kaseya to deliver the ransomware.

""Kaseya was the only common touch point between the MSPs clients and it is obvious that the delivery method leveraged Kaseya's automation by dropping a batch file on the target machine and executing via agent procedure or PowerShell,"" the researcher claimed. As with the Webroot console, the MSP did not appear to have implemented 2FA for accessing the Kaseya console.

In emailed comments, John Durant, CTO at Kaseya, confirmed the incident.""We are aware of limited instances where customers were targeted by threat actors who leveraged compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to privileged resources,"" Durant says. ""All available evidence at our disposal points to the use of compromised credentials.""

In February, attackers pulled off an almost identical attack against another US-based MSP. In that incident, between 1,500 and 2,000 computers belonging to the MSP's customers were simultaneously encrypted with GandCrab ransomware. Then, as now, the attackers are believed to have used Kaseya's remote monitoring and management tool to distribute the malware.

MSPs and IT administrators continue to be targets for attackers looking to gain credentials for unauthorized access, Durant says. ""We continue to urge customers to employ best practices around securing their credentials, regularly rotating passwords, and strengthening their security hygiene,"" he says.

An 160ft exclusion zone has been erected in Birmingham - after a Second World War grenade was found.

The discovery of the WWII device came on Thursday, January 2.

Bomb disposal experts are being sent to the scene as a large area is sealed off near the A457 Spring Hill at Winson Green, in Birmingham.

The grenade was discovered in a canal off Clissold Passage at around 11am today.

West Midlands Police officers were sent to the scene and a 50 metre, 160ft, area was sealed as bomb disposal experts were alerted.

The force said in a statement: ""Police were called after a suspected World War II grenade was found in a canal off Clissold Passage, Winson Green, at around 11am.""

West Midlands Police continued: ""A 50-metre cordon has been put in place and the explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team has been called to assess the device.""

As far back as 2009, the Construction Industry Research and Information Association estimated that, between 2006 and 2009, about 15,000 devices, including grenades, had been removed from UK towns and cities.

It is impossible to know how many devices are out there, according to Matt Brosnan, a historian at the Imperial War Museum.

Mr Brosnan told the BBC: ""Just to put it in context, the Luftwaffe dropped 24,000 tonnes of high explosive on London in 85 major raids during the war.

""Clearly not all of those would have exploded, because of defects or other reasons, and they could have buried themselves tens of feet below the surface so we simply don't know where they are.""

Ending Donald Trump's presidency is important, but the task also includes launching the era that must come next, tackling urgent crises in our nation.

A decade ago, I came to Iowa knocking doors for a young presidential candidate with a funny name. The stakes were high in that election. They are enormous now.

Traveling throughout Iowa this year, I’ve met workers facing rising costs and stagnant wages. Farmers are paying the price of a reckless trade war. Our children are learning active shooter drills before they learn to read.

Iowans cannot afford four more years of this president or the division that he exploits. On the morning after this president leaves office, the sun will come up on a country even more bitterly divided than we are now, exhausted from fighting — and still facing urgent crises.

This election will decide whether the next president will mobilize Americans behind bold ideas or polarize them around the same Washington fights that have held us back for decades. We need to elect a president who can not only end the era of Donald Trump, but can launch the era that must come next. I’m running for president to lead a nation done with division and hungry for action.

I’ve seen that hunger on display throughout Iowa.

Policies to serve people

I’ve seen it in the Des Moines mother who wrote me that her medical bills had become so expensive that she and her parents sold their homes to pay for her 24-hour care. That’s why I’ve proposed Medicare for All Who Want It, which guarantees every American affordable coverage while letting you choose which plan is best for you, and introduced Long-Term Care America to ensure all Americans are supported. I measure the power of an idea not by how much controversy it generates, but by how many people it can help.

In a sweltering barn in Shenandoah, I met a young man who wanted to know how agriculture in the Midwest could help lead the fight against climate change. He said that people tend to forget about them. I told him how we’d put rural communities like his at the center of a national project and achieve a net-zero carbon economy by 2050.

During a Fourth of July parade in Storm Lake, I marched alongside 24 floats proudly displaying the two dozen countries that made up the area’s immigrant population. Places like Storm Lake inspired my plan for community renewal visas to attract immigrants to areas experiencing population decline, and strengthen my faith that we can manage our border in accordance with our values and our laws.

Trump should have stayed in the Iran deal: Attack on US embassy in Iraq shows Trump is failing. He walked into Iran's trap.

And I’ve seen that spirit in a teenager from Muscatine who found the courage to be open about her autism after watching our campaign lead with values of inclusion and belonging.

It may seem out of place, to emphasize unity and belonging at a time like this. But my sense of hope is based not in my age but in my experience.

The future can be better

In the dust of a war zone, I saw fellow Americans who had nothing in common besides the flag on our shoulders learn to trust each other with our lives. Amid the ruins of old factories, I saw my hometown answer those who called us a “dying city” by rising up and forging a new future.

Make the center hold: Truce? Progressive Democrats need Republican moderates to beat Donald Trump in 2020

One afternoon in South Bend, I walked into my church, having once believed that something inside would make me forever an outsider — and walked out a married man. And in some of the most conservative counties in Iowa, and in more than 20 counties I’ve visited that voted for Barack Obama and then Donald Trump, I’ve witnessed the makings of an American majority made up of progressives, moderates, and even what I like to call “future former Republicans” sickened by the actions of this president, ready for something better.

What I’ve seen in Iowa has made me a better candidate, and it will make me a better president. There’s still plenty of work to be done before the caucus on Feb. 3. But I am forever grateful to have been welcomed into your communities. Propelled by your stories and your support, we can change the trajectory of our nation and usher in that era that must come next.

28861,2746e097bdee74eb68a92d414fd7a9a2,"(Bloomberg) -- Gaming company Razer Inc. has teamed up with homegrown Singaporean entrepreneurs and Asian billionaires to apply for a full digital banking license, joining the race to create virtual lenders in the city state.Razer Fintech, the company’s financial technology unit, will own a 60% stake in the group, while five partners will hold the remaining 40%, according to a statement. They are Sheng Siong Holdings Pte, the private company of the Singaporean Lim brothers behind a popular local supermarket chain; billionaire Richard Li’s insurance company FWD Group; internet entrepreneur Chen Danian’s tech company LinkSure Global Holdings Ltd.; Insignia Ventures Partners; and Carro, an online car marketplace.

Razer’s consortium is the second group to submit an application for the digital full banking license after Grab Holdings Inc. and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. announced their joint bid on Dec. 30. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is set to announce the winners of five digital banking licenses in mid-2020.

Efforts to open up the Singapore banking industry to technology companies come on the heels of a similar move in Hong Kong, where units of Ant Financial and other Chinese firms including Tencent Holdings Ltd. obtained licenses. Southeast Asia’s digital lending market is expected to more than quadruple to $110 billion by 2025, according to a report by Bain & Co., Google and Temasek Holdings Pte.Instead of fighting local banks, Razer Fintech plans to target the youth and millennial segment in Singapore. But eventually, it aims to roll out globally as Razer Youth Bank, making it the first bank of its kind.

“Youth and millennials are underserved even in a crowded space like Singapore,” said Lee Li Meng, Razer’s chief strategy officer who assumed an additional role as chief executive officer of Razer Fintech from Jan. 1. Targeting those in the age group of 12 to 35 years, he said many young people grow up with little financial knowledge. When they join the workforce they struggle to open a bank account or get a credit card or loans due to lack of savings and credit history. “We want to help them from a young age,” Lee said.

Razer is trying to leverage on its large, young fan base and its existing digital payments networks Razer Merchant Services and e-wallet service Razer Pay. It’s also looking to its global presence -- the company is based in Singapore and San Francisco but has retail stores in places like London, Las Vegas, Hong Kong and Taipei -- to boost its digital bank’s international prospects.

It’s also trying to capitalize on younger consumers who use their mobile phones to read, chat and play, and stream music and videos. Such users will expect to use mobile phones to manage their money and trade stocks for more convenient and speedier services, Lee said.

Razer Co-Founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan has been trying to build an ecosystem of software and services for gamers to reduce Razer’s reliance on hardware peripherals such as gaming mice and keyboards. It got into the digital wallet business by acquiring e-payments platform MOL Global.

Since forming Razer Fintech as a separate entity in April 2018, it has built a large digital payment network in Southeast Asia and processed more than billions of dollars in total payment value. Razer Fintech has about 200 employees and some of its most prominent hires include Lim Siong Guan, former president of GIC Pte, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.

“We’ve thought about this long and hard,” Lee said. “We believe that we can do something revolutionary here in Singapore.”

Dozens of rockets fired from Gaza after Israel assassinates senior Islamic Jihad leader Read More »

Gaza's Ministry of Interior has already arrested six members of a cell they say was working under the command of Shaaban al-Garbawi, the PA General Intelligence Services officer accused of collaborating with Israel.

Under Garbawi's leadership, the ministry says, the men spied on an Islamic State leader, Bahaa Abu al-Ata, for several months before he was assassinated, along with his wife, Asmaa, by Israeli fighter jets at their Gaza City home on 12 November.

The information they gathered was shared with Israeli intelligence services, according to the ministry.

The Fatah movement, which dominates the PA, has denied the allegations. “It is all lies and has no base in reality,” Fatah said in a statement.

The assassination led to two days of fighting between Israel and Palestinian movements in which Israeli air strikes killed 34 Palestinians, including women and children, before a ceasefire was agreed.

'Ya Barry'

In the recording made public on Thursday, a voice which Gaza's interior ministry say is Gharbawi is heard telling another man, who the ministry says is an Israeli intelligence agent named Barry, the details of Palestinian fighters' activities and plans along the Gaza-Israel border.

“Barry, the al-Quds Brigades had a meeting with the military council and Bahaa Abu al-Ata was present, and they gave instructions for a monitoring operation for three days to carry out an attack using a Kornet missile,"" the voice is heard saying.

""They are working on three targets, ya Barry,” he continues, and then he lists targets. Barry's voice is barely audible in the background.

'It is just a failed attempt to disguise the agreements for a long truce with the occupation' - Fatah movement statement

Fatah in its statement dismissing the allegations said it had grown accustomed to ""Hamas' lies"". ""It is just a failed attempt to disguise the agreements for a long truce with the occupation,"" the movement said, referring to Israel.

""In return, Israel would recognise the Emirate of Gaza, and start implementing the Deal of the Century that aims to put an end to the Palestinian national project and selling Jerusalem and its sacred places.""

Fatah and Hamas have been locked in a tit-for-tat row since 2006 after Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections. The following year, the PA split. Since then, Hamas has been the de facto government in Gaza, with Fatah running the West Bank, with ongoing tensions between the two.

Abu al-Ata was a senior leader in the Quds Brigades, Islamic Jihad's military wing. He joined the movement in 1990, eventually becoming the commander of the northern Gaza Strip.

Israel tried three times to assassinate him, most recently in 2014. He was also jailed in PA prisons several times over his activities in the Quds Brigades.

28966,924bd223e34e8b803ccfd549059da801,"Noted cosmetic surgeon Dr Viral Desai from Mumbai, who was accused by a television actress of rape in August last year, has been granted anticipatory bail by the Mumbai Sessions Court.

The complainant had filed a complaint against Dr Viral Desai, alleging that he tried to sexually assault her in his clinic on August 9, 2019. Based on the complaint, a case of rape was registered.

Dr Viral Desai has claimed that he and the complainant were in a consensual relationship and that she had purposefully misrepresented the facts in her complaint. He submitted evidence in the form of photographs and WhatsApp messages exchanged with the complainant, which showed that he and the complainant were in a consensual relationship since last few years.

Dr Desai drew the attention of the court to the fact that immediately after the alleged incident of rape, the complainant herself took the doctor for dinner to a restaurant from his clinic and continued to chat with him on a regular basis.

Additional Sessions Judge Kalpana S Hore granted relief to Dr Desai on November 19, 2019.

Dr Desai's counsel, Parvez Memon, senior partner of MZM Legal, pointed out to the court that the complainant is a forty-two-year-old actress who is going through a troubled marriage and is amidst a divorce case in the family court. There cannot have been a relationship on the basis of a promise of marriage since the complainant was already married, argued Memon.

29066,b0b706b93a4d62cdc0224d8f68f373ae,"Reliance Life Sciences won a case against Roche, 4 years after the MNC sued to stave off challenge to a hit breast cancer drug

Five years ago, we had predicted that regulatory battles between generic drug manufacturers of biosimilars and originator companies would prove to be tougher and dirtier than the patent battles witnessed in the past. And so it has come to pass.

A biosimilar is a biologic medical product very similar to an approved biological medicine. Unlike generic versions of chemically synthesised drugs, biosimilars are approved according to the same standards of pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy that apply to all biological medicines. The makers have to conduct their own clinical trials because of the complexity of biologics which use living cells to produce the core molecule, the innovator product. And that, too, has inherent variability in each lot.

In September, Reliance Life Sciences (RLS) finally won its case against Roche, four years after the multinational filed a suit in the Delhi High Court restraining it from marketing their products as equivalent to their top selling biologic trastuzumab, which is used to treat a particularly virulent kind of breast cancer. Sold under the brand name Herceptin, it had last raked in nearly $7 billion in global sales annually for Roche.

In India, it had earned R130 crore some five years ago. The RLS case, instituted in 2015 soon after a similar high-profile case against Biocon-Mylan, which was set to become the world’s first biosimilar for trastuzumab, was won in appeal (filed in 2016) against a bizarre order passed by Justice Manmohan Singh that the manufacturer could not refer to the original drug in any way.

That drug majors will stoop to any level to fight competition from companies offering a much cheaper version of their drugs is well known. Since it did not have a valid patent for trastuzumab in India, its case against these firms was centred on their alleged “passing off” of their biosimilars as the original. It was telling that the judges hearing the RLS appeal noted that the appellant’s claim that the Roche suit was “actuated by malice — with the object of stifling competition — needs serious consideration”. Not that Roche is targeting just Indian companies.

In 2018 it sued Pfizer, a fellow pharma giant, for patent infringement, soon after the latter applied for regulatory approval of its trastuzumab biosimilar. Roche claimed that Pfizer had infringed 40 of its patents on the drug. This is the biggest sticking point for makers of similar biologics. Legal experts in the US have warned of the biosimilar patent dance, which they say is “a convoluted and often uncertain process” by which the patent issues are resolved before the launch of a biosimilar.

Manufacturers of generics have Food and Drug Administrations’s (FDA’s) Orange Book of patent and data exclusivity in the US whereas firms making biosimilars do not have such a record. The FDA’s Purple Book lists biological products, including biosimilars, and the date of licensing but does not list the patents. If a Bill to set right the lacuna is passed by the US Senate, the FDA would be obliged to list the patents for biologics in the Purple Book. Till then, there will be few launches of biosimilars.

29094,38f4f6c9303b51f61d7d0836ff574c01,"An urgent pre-trial conference on Daniel Augustin De Costa’s criminal defamation case will be held on Fri morning (3 Jan) at 11.30am in Court 15A of the State Courts, with M Ravi acting as defence counsel.

Carson Law Chambers on its Facebook page today said that the pre-trial conference will be held as a result of the Prosecution’s alleged refusal “to disclose the accused’s statements made to the police”.

M Ravi, a lawyer from Carson Law Chambers representing Mr De Costa in the immediate case, is seeking to rely on the above in the upcoming hearing, scheduled to take place on 20 Jan at 9.30am in open court at Court 15A, according to the law firm.

Mr Ravi will do so “in support of his client’s challenge to the constitutionality of the criminal charges”, as the criminal charges “arguably violate the right to equality provision (Article 12)”, particularly “owing to the non- prosecution of PM Lee’s siblings by the Attorney General for allegedly making similar if not more serious allegations against the PM and members of the cabinet”, added Carson Law Chambers.

“The police statements (called the long statements) made by the accused are usually given to Defence lawyers under the Criminal Case Disclosure Conference (CCDC) for District Court cases.

“Unlike the District Court cases, the prosecution retains its discretion for Magistrates Court cases,” according to Carson Law Chambers.

Carson Law Chambers added that M Ravi had earlier applied to the court under section 171 of the Criminal Procedure Code for the court to convene an urgent pre-trial conference.

The pre-trial conference, added the firm, aims at directing the prosecution to disclose Mr De Costa’s police statements to enable the accused’s statements to be addressed in court “with regards to the allegations made by the Lee Siblings in the statements with reference to the criminal charge”.

M Ravi last month filed an application on behalf of Mr De Costa to have his client’s criminal defamation case stated in the High Court for the purpose of raising the question as to whether the prosecution of De Costa contravenes the equality provision of Article 12 of the Constitution.

Mr De Costa was charged on 13 Dec 2018 under Section 500 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev. Ed. 2008) for criminal defamation, the following of which is the full charge:

‘… that you on 4th September 2018, at about 7:24pm, at an Internet café located in Chinatown, Singapore had defamed members of the Cabinet of Singapore by making an imputation concerning members of the Cabinet of Singapore by words intended to be read, to wit, by sending an email titled ‘PAP MP apologises to SP’ from [email protected] to [email protected] which you had written and which stated that there was ‘corruption at the highest echelons’ intending that the contents of the said email would be published on the website www.theonlinecitizen.com, knowing that such imputation would harm the reputation of members of the Cabinet of Singapore […]”

Published on 4 Sep 2018, the article, submitted by De Costa under the pseudonym Willy Sum, alleged that “we have seen multiple policy and foreign screw-ups, tampering of the Constitution, corruption at the highest echelons and apparent lack of respect from foreign powers ever since the demise of founding father Lee Kuan Yew”.

Mr Ravi in his application, pointed out that other publications, such as the Joint Statement of Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang – siblings of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong – made similar or worse imputations that were directed squarely at the Prime Minister, a member of the Cabinet.

The application highlights a segment of the Joint Statement by Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang where they wrote, “Lee Hsien Loong misused his powers as Prime Minister, and that he hijacked the organs of state to pursue his own personal desires” against De Costa’s offending words, “corruption at the highest echelons”.

The offending article was taken down under the orders of Infocomms and Media Development Authority (IMDA) on 18 Sep 2018. IMDA then reported the article to the Singapore Police Force the following month on 8 Oct 2018.

On 20 Nov 2018, the police seized electronic devices from Terry Xu, TOC‘s editor-in-chief, and Mr De Costa’s respective residences under court orders.

Mr Xu was subjected to an eight-hour interview with the police on the day itself, while De Costa was interviewed at a later date.

Under Section 500 of the Penal Code, those found guilty of criminal defamation may be subject to maximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment or a fine or both.

Carson Law Chambers in its statement today noted that the application that will be heard in the pre-trial conference tomorrow “engages the question of the right to fair trial and due process for accused persons facing Magistrates’ Arrest Courts (MAC) which we believe represent majority of criminal cases in Singapore”.

The law firm added that it will be posting further updates following tomorrow’s pre-trial conference."," Accuse of crime, corruption",3

The child was covered by bags of fruit and vegetables before he was discovered by police.

He was found at the Beni-Enzar border crossing in the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla on the northwest coast of Africa on 31 December.

It is understood the boy's mother, who was found living at a temporary shelter for migrants, had paid for him to be taken to Europe, but it is not known if he had family waiting for him on the other side.

The couple were arrested and the child taken to be with his mum.

Morocco has become a major gateway into Europe for migrants.

In January of last year, Spanish border guards discovered two migrants hidden inside mattresses strapped to the roof of a car at a checkpoint on the frontier with Morocco.

Video footage of the incident, reportedly filmed in Melilla, was published on social media by a senator in the Spanish parliament.

The fire ignited shortly before 3 a.m. on 630 E. Lambert Road and nearby residents were temporarily evacuated “out of an abundance of caution” as firefighters worked to extinguish the flames, the Brea Police Department said.

The first responding crew quickly left the structure after they realized it was a chemical response that likely exposed them to a hazardous material, Brea Fire Department Investigator Nicole Pesqueira told KTLA. They were all evaluated for exposure and no one was hurt.

Hazmat teams were called to the plant and they extinguished the fire.

They determined the material was an Alkaline-based chemical, according to Pesqueira.

Ten employees who were inside the plant were evacuated and no one was injured, according to fire officials.

The incident resulted in the closure of Lambert Road between State College Boulevard and Cliffwood Avenue.

Evacuated residents were told to head to the Brea Community Center on Madison Way before the orders were lifted about an hour later, according to the city’s emergency preparedness program.

City firefighters were joined by crews from Fullerton, Anaheim, Orange County and Los Angeles County.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.

Diogo Pires was only 20 when he served as a Supreme Court judge in Portugal. It was 1521, two decades after the forced conversion of Portugal’s Jews, and the brilliant young judge had a secret: he was a Jew. He would soon leave the court and the country and become one of the most influential kabbalists of all time. Justice Diego Pires would soon become Rabbi Shlomo Molcho, and he would be burned at the stake for doing so.

Nearly 500 years after he died al Kiddush Hashem, Molcho is in the news again. His manuscript commentaries on the Bible and Zohar were collected from various archives around the world and published as Kitvei Rabbi Shlomo Molcho Hakadosh in Jerusalem. (Disclaimer: This writer spent three years editing the commentaries.)

In addition, a first-ever public memorial for Molcho is being held in Jerusalem to mark his assumed yahrzeit (the 5th of Tevet), a video about his life was produced for social media (“Sipuro Shel Shlomo Molcho,” in Hebrew) and a Hebrew pop song was written about him (“Shlomo Bechiri”).

Molcho was born to a Marrano family in Portugal sometime between late 1500 and early 1502. Many of the Jews expelled from Spain in 1492 had moved to adjacent Portugal, but in 1497 the Jews once again were forced to convert.

In 1521, when Molcho would have been 20 or perhaps even 19, he is referred to in Portuguese documents as Dr. Diogo Pires. That year, the king appointed him to the Court of Appeals, the country’s highest court, and also guaranteed him a second income by putting him in charge of the court stenographer’s office. This latter position explains why Jewish writers often described him as scribe to the king.

In December 1525, one of the more interesting figures in Jewish history appeared in the royal court in Lisbon: David Reuveni. He claimed his bother ruled over a kingdom of the lost tribes and needed weapons to wrest the Holy Land from the Moslems. The king received Reuveni with honors. The Marranos of Lisbon were flabbergasted: Here was a Jew dressed regally, carrying a flag with the 10 Commandments embroidered on it and negotiating with the king.

Diego Pires met Reuveni in the royal court and asked him to teach him Torah. Reuveni tried to dissuade him. Pires believed Reubeni didn’t want to teach him because, as a Marrano, he had not been circumcised. So he circumcised himself, enduring several days of excruciating pain and, shortly afterward, he had dreams in which he was taught the mysteries of the Torah and shown what his fate would be. He returned to Reuveni and announced he was now part of the Covenant of Abraham and again asked to be instructed in Jewish law.

Reuveni, a more astute politician than the young dreamer and idealist, correctly predicted that when news of Pires’ return to Judaism became public, both of them would be thrown out of Portugal. Indeed, Reubeni’s negotiations were soon cut short and he made his way through Europe, while Pires adopted the name Shlomo Molcho and made his way through Italy to Salonika, in the Ottoman Empire, where he was free from Christian oppression.

Molcho met Rabbi Yosef Taitazak, a great posek at the time, and apparently studied in his yeshiva in Salonika. His fellow students included Rabbi Moshe Alshich (the Alshich Hakadosh) and Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz. The yeshiva was not known for kabbalistic studies, yet, influenced by the charismatic Molcho, a number of its students turned to Kabbalah and – like Alkabetz who would write Lecha Dodi – became some of its major proponents.

Molcho won a reputation for being able to answer any question posed about the Torah, and people came from far away to pose questions to him. At the request of his friends or admirers in Salonika, Molcho wrote a book of commentaries that was published in August 1529.

Molcho did not bother naming the book, but after his death it was republished under the title Sefer HaMefoar (The Wondrous Book). In it, Molcho explains the nature of the soul and attributes Adam and Eve’s sin to their preferring material pleasure to divine contemplation – a sin he says the Israelites repeated in the desert when they preferred Egyptian fruits and fish to manna from heaven.

Molcho also interprets the Books of Ruth and Job as allegories for Jewish history and the redemption of Israel and reveals connections between dozens of seemingly unconnected Biblical verses.

Molcho’s own copy of his book is marked with corrections and edits, but these remained undiscovered until a few years ago and unpublished until this year, when they were included in the new Jerusalem edition of his works.

One of the first dreams Molcho had after his return to Judaism was of his being killed while trying to save flocks of doves that were under attack by other nations. Believing that he had a role to play in the process of redemption and in saving the Jews from oppression, Molcho left the safety of the Ottoman Empire and headed for the lion’s den – the center of Christian power, Rome.

Apparently Molcho’s reputation preceded him, and some Jews were afraid he would anger the Christian authorities, so they informed on him. Molcho wasn’t deterred; he went straight to the pope. He emerged from his meeting with Pope Clement VII’s permission to publicize Torah teachings offering comfort to the Jewish people as long as he did not malign Christianity.

An even cursory reading of Kitvei R. Shlomo Molcho Hakadosh, however, reveals he did not abide by these terms; he issued dire predictions for what would happen to the Christians when they were judged by heaven.

The pope nonetheless continued to protect Molcho, and Molcho repaid the favor by warning the pope that a flood was about to inundate the city. The flood struck on October 8, 1530, killing some 10,000 people.

Molcho then sent a message to his former friend, the king of Portugal, warning that an earthquake was imminent and, indeed, on January 26, 1531, a quake destroyed one-third of the houses in Lisbon. Molcho also predicted the appearance of a comet, which turned out to be Hailey’s Comet, whose cycle was unknown at the time.

The pope came to view Molcho as a seer and a strategic asset, and Molcho supposedly used his influence to delay the imposition of the Inquisition in Portugal.

Molcho wrote a second book of commentaries, among other things elaborating on the two messiahs of Jewish tradition, their respective roles in redemption, the wars of Gog and Magog, and the rivalry between Jacob and Esav. The book’s main theme is that for redemption to come, the Jewish people have to master not only the trait of mercy but also of strength; that for Israel’s enemies to be destroyed, Gad g’dud yegudenu – the people of Israel will have to form legions to fight wars.

One chapter comes close to poetry when it tells of the journey of the soul after death as it is greeted by our forefathers. A particularly beautiful section relates that every night our forefathers remember the destruction and pine for the messiah, and the messiah sees our mother Rachel weeping and he weeps, too. Our fathers hope the Divine Wisdom will inspire the messiah so our people can be freed, but G-d doesn’t want to have to punish the many evildoers he finds in Israel, so the redemption is delayed for another day.

The book remained in manuscript form and, except for excerpts, was not published until its inclusion in this year’s new edition of Molcho’s works.

In 1532, Molcho decided the time had come to act on his mission. Analyzing the geopolitical situation, he saw that the Christian leaders of Europe were fighting and losing battles with the Moslems of the Ottoman Empire. Molcho raised his own flag, embroidered with various Biblical verses and holy names, found and took him David Reuveni along, and set off to meet the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V.

The pair spent two hours with the emperor. Molcho proposed establishing a Jewish-Christian army to fight the Moslems and offered to lead it into battle. The emperor was aghast; a Jewish army would be bad enough, but the idea of a Jewish commander in chief was anathema. The emperor sent Reuveni to jail and sent Molcho to the Inquisition for trial and execution.

The Inquisitors feared Molcho because of his reputation as a seer and kabbalist. They gagged him as he was led to the auto-da-fé to prevent him from uttering any magic formulas or to prevent him from swaying the crowd. Just before he was executed, a messenger from Charles V arrived with an offer of clemency if Molcho recanted and converted to Christianity.

Molcho’s gag was removed. He replied that his only regret was that he had ever lived in Christian society, and now he was ready for his soul to return to its home with G-d.

Molcho’s lasting influence was felt in several ways. At the time, his public drashot in synagogues lifted the spirits of a downtrodden, oppressed people and kept alive the hope of redemption. His approach – that the redemption would come with strategic, political thinking and activity – would bear fruit only centuries later.

His rabbinical colleagues were greatly affected by his death. Rabbi Joseph Karo, the author of the Shulchan Aruch, called Molcho “Shlomo Bechiri” (Shlomo, G-d’s chosen one) and prayed he would die like Molcho.

A few months after the execution, Rabbi Karo gathered with his friends for a nighttime of Torah learning. Apparently still shaken by the death of the charismatic dreamer who had given them such comfort, they heard a bat kol that night, which told them to go Eretz Yisrael and teach Torah there. They went, and thus was founded the kabbalistic community of Tzefas."," Threaten, not specified below",3

He made the statement amid the possible US entry ban on officials involved in the legislator's detention.

""It is lamentable that she is seeking international sympathy for her alleged wrongful detention, despite the fact that even the Supreme Court itself upheld the legality of her arrest,"" Jimenez said in a statement forwarded by his office to GMA News Online on Thursday.

He said that the drug-related charges that the VACC lodged at the Department of Justice against De Lima followed procedural due process.

In December US President Donald Trump signed the 2020 federal budget, which includes a provision banning the entry of Philippine government officials involved in De Lima's detention.

It was stated that the ban shall apply on an official if US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo finds ""credible information"" about his or her involvement in the ""wrongful imprisonment"" of De Lima, who was arrested on drug charges in February 2017.

De Lima, a staunch critic of President Rodrigo Duterte, has denied the allegations.

Jimenez, who was among those whom De Lima included in the initial list, decried the development.

""Most of the members in the VACC are victims of illegal drug-related crimes. It is unfortunate that those who are merely in pursuit of justice are the one being harassed and persecuted for it,"" he said.

Jimenez has said he became an anti-crime advocate after his brother Jaime was killed in 1990, supposedly by a drug syndicate.

Amid the issue, the PACC chair said that it is high time for the government to continue to put traffickers of illegal drugs to justice.

""This is the perfect opportunity for the government to exercise its political will to its fullest extent, and show its seriousness in curbing the illegal drug problem in the country,"" Jimenez said.

In response to the provision on the entry ban to the US for alleged persecutors of De Lima, Duterte has barred its proponents, US Democratic Senators Richard Durbin and Patrick Leahy, from setting foot in the Philippines.

Duterte later barred another Democratic lawmaker, Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts, who called for De Lima's release.

Malacañang also said that visas will be required from American citizens if the US entry ban would be imposed against Philippine government officials.

“Should a ban from entry into US territory be enforced against Philippine officials involved in—or by reason of—Senator De Lima's lawful imprisonment, this government will require all Americans intending to come to the Philippines to apply and secure a visa before they can enter Philippine territory,” presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said. — BM, GMA News

Larry Lord, the man credited with saving lives before the deadly September gas explosion in Farmington, was still at a Massachusetts hospital as the New Year began.

Lord remains in serious condition at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he has been since suffering critical injuries in the Sept. 16 gas explosion, a hospital spokeswoman said Thursday morning.

Lord’s condition was upgraded from serious to fair in November before his condition worsened late last month. He was listed in critical condition for close to a month after he was admitted into the Boston hospital.

An explosion leveled a two-story building that housed the central offices for a nonprofit, LEAP Inc., that serves adults with developmental disabilities at 313 Farmington Falls Road — also known as Route 2 — just after 8 a.m. Sept. 16. The powerful explosion could be heard from as far away as Livermore, which is more than 30 miles southwest.

The blast killed Farmington fire Capt. Michael Bell, 68, a 30-year veteran of the department and brother of the department’s chief. Six other firefighters were injured in the blast, including Fire Chief Terry Bell; Deputy Fire Chief Clyde Ross; Capt. Timothy Hardy; Capt. Scott Baxter; his father, Theodore Baxter; and Joseph Hastings.

The firefighters had been called to LEAP’s offices for a propane leak.

Ross was treated and released from a Farmington hospital on Sept. 16. Hastings was released on Sept. 18, Hardy was released on Sept. 19, Theodore Baxter was released on Sept. 23, Terry Bell was released on Oct. 8 and Scott Baxter was released Oct. 13, all of whom were treated at Maine Medical Center in Portland.

Lord, the maintenance manager at LEAP, suffered severe burns on over half his body, multiple traumas, broken bones and critical injuries in the blast. He was the only LEAP employee injured in the blast.

Lord was lauded as a hero for saving the lives of LEAP employees when he alerted people to the smell of gas prior to the explosion and helped evacuate them."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

“Halt New Taxes Here” reads a sign leaning outside Hurricane City Library. Inside, local volunteers are collecting signatures from registered voters and residents of Washington County in an effort to contest the state’s latest tax reform bill.

This gathering, along with several others planned over the next few weeks, is part of a larger citizen referendum going on across the state to put the legislation on the November ballot.

Hurricane resident Paula Arriola showed up at the signing event at the library Tuesday morning. She said she's living on a fixed income and is worried about what the tax reform bill could mean for her.

""[State legislators] need to stand up for what we think, not just what's good for them. They aren't taking us into consideration,"" Arriola said before signing onto the referendum.

The bill that sparked this response came from a special session that was held by Utah Legislature in mid-December. The bill lowers the state income tax and offers tax breaks for low- to moderate-income residents. It also increases the state sales tax for food to 4.85%. Taxes on wholesale gasoline, which was already going to rise in 2020, is also increasing.

Gov. Gary Herbert signed the bill, but because it failed to receive the support of at least two-thirds of the legislature residents have a chance to challenge the law with a statewide referendum.

How many signatures to get on the ballot?

To get the referendum on the ballot, about 116,000 signatures are needed, and they need to come from at least 15 of the 29 counties in Utah. Despite the referendum starting over the holidays — and ending before the next legislative session begins later this month — Larry Meyers, one of the organizers of the movement in Washington County said he's hopeful the minimum quota can be met by the Jan. 20 deadline.

“It’s been tough because of the holidays. People are not focused on politics right now,” said Meyers, who is president of a local political advocacy group called the Dixie Republican Forum. “It would be nice to have a little bit more time. [The Legislature] chose to do this at a time that would be maximum difficulty for us on the referendum side. We’re up against some tough deadlines here.”

Washington County needs at least 6,000 signatures to help meet the state goal, but Meyers said they’re shooting for 10,000. Signatures, and other verification information, are collected in booklets managed by volunteers and then turned into the county recorder office. There can be issues if anything is illegible or can’t be verified, which is why Meyers said they’re aiming for a higher mark.

Meyers and other coordinators like Utah State School Board member Michelle Boulter are holding signing opportunities for residents through the coming weeks. Most of their organizing has been on Facebook, and the group is updating signing events in the group, Washington County UT 2019 Tax Referendum.

Boulter, who is running for the District 29 state Senate seat, plans on volunteering as much as possible over the coming weeks. She said she's heard about local businesses and families holding their own signing events to get the referendum on the ballot. For people who would like to collect signatures on their own, Boulter said there are some basic training points to go over to make sure all signatures are counted.

Other's hoping for referendum

Hurricane resident Willie Billings, a former chair of the county Republican party, picked up a referendum packet on Tuesday to collect his own signatures. He's planning to talk to everyone in his ""center of influence"" to get them to sign on.

""I feel like this [bill] is too large, too sweeping and unnecessary at this point in time,"" he said. ""Raising taxes is a never, especially if it's not absolutely mandatory, and this is not.""

As people come in and out of the library, Boulter said it’s been “amazing” to see the people respond to the bill.

“The people know what they want, and they want to be listened to. And it’s high time our elected officials do that,"" Boulter said.

29803,cda66cd9ac070a5480213f4d12466117,"Turkey's parliament on Thursday passed a bill that allows troop deployment to Libya, Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop said, paving the way for increased military cooperation despite criticism from opposition lawmakers.

Sentop said the legislation passed with an 325-184 vote in the parliament, where President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party and its nationalist allies hold a majority. All major opposition parties in the assembly voted against the bill.

Analysts and officials say Ankara is unlikely to immediately send troops, but rather military advisers and equipment.

A senior Turkish official said last week Turkey may train Libyan soldiers in Turkey, and Reuters reported that Ankara is also considering sending allied Syrian fighters to Tripoli as part of the planned military support.

On Wednesday, Vice President Fuat Oktay said the bill served a symbolic role that Ankara hoped would be a ""deterrent"" to the parties, and that Turkey may not send troops if Haftar's forces halted their offensive and pulled back.

""The deployment will likely start with military advisers, increased (drones), and special operations that would work with the Libyan military,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who is chairman of the think-tank Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies.

""The hope would be that the Turkish military may not itself be involved in military action,"" he said.

Erdogan's ruling AK Party and its nationalist allies are expected to back the legislation on Thursday despite opposition from the other major parties that say military support would cause Libya's conflict to spread across the region and endanger Turkey's safety.

Ankara signed a military cooperation accord with Tripoli in November and has said it would help prevent Libya sliding into ""chaos."" It is also meant to protect Turkish private investment in Libya and bolster Turkey's offshore energy claims in the Mediterranean.

But it could also put Turkey at odds with the other foreign players in Libya's war and in the region. The Arab League is the latest to warn against the deployment of foreign fighters in the North African country.

Earlier Erdogan said that Turkey will not stay silent over Russian-backed mercenaries supporting Khalifa Haftar in Libya, as Moscow voiced concerns over possible Turkish military deployment to Libya in support of Haftar's enemies.

""Ankara sees its involvement in Libya as a symbol of its new status as a regional power,"" said Asli Aydintasbas, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""The idea is, to be at the big table, you need to be present on the ground."""," Threaten, not specified below",3

In a press conference on Thursday, officials of We Move Things Philippines, Inc., the corporate name of JoyRide, said they had not hired bikers who previously worked at Angkas, or DBDOYC, Inc.

“We’ve never gotten riders from Angkas,” said JoyRide Vice-President for Corporate Affairs Jose Emmanuel “Noli” M. Eala.

His disclaimer comes as Angkas is required to displace around 17,000 bikers to comply with the cap set equally among operating motorcycle taxi companies.

“Kung meron gusto sumama sa amin (If any of their riders want to join us), [they are] all welcome provided they have to go through our process again,” he said.

At present, JoyRide has 1,493 JoyRide bikers on Metro Manila roads, with 5,414 going through the on-boarding process. The process includes two days of seminars and test drives.

Last week, the Philippine Competition Commission’s Johannes Benjamin R. Bernabe last week cautioned against the cap, as it removes a bulk of the rider-base Angkas built up.

Mr. Eala later in the press conference noted that JoyRide does not check biker affiliations.

“We do not differentiate. We do not even ask if they have any affiliations with any other riders because they have to go through the same process anyway. It doesn’t matter to us kung kayo ay dati nang tumakbo (if you have worked) as Angkas or colorum. Basta ang importante po ay dumaan uli sila sa isang proseso. (What matters is that they go through a process).”

JoyRide also denied claims that government officials have business interests in their company, attributing ownership to entrepreneurs Ralph Nubla Jr. and Bea Chua.

JoyRide admitted to asking Senator Aquilino Martin D. Pimentel III to transmit a letter to the Department of Transportation. Mr. Eala described the lawmaker as a family friend of the owners. JoyRide denied allegations that the Pimentel family has a stake in the company.

The technical working group for motorcycle taxis extended the pilot program for the three companies Angkas, JoyRide, and MoveIt up to March 23, 2020, with no plans of further extensions. — Jenina P. Ibañez

29903,b7576b7d9b5872678c0128a1f099a6a4,"The Trump administration quietly used loopholes built into the 2017 tax cuts to give big corporations an even bigger tax savings.

The tax cut bill passed by Republicans in 2017 overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and big corporations, according to a House Budget Committee report issued earlier this year. The law gave individuals a modest short-term tax cut while permanently slashing corporate taxes from 35 percent to 21 percent. The new law has greatly contributed to the 50 percent growth in the budget deficit since President Trump took office.

But that was not enough for big corporations, which launched intense lobbying efforts to carve out even bigger breaks in the bill’s loopholes. The effort led the Treasury Department to quietly change rules to hand big companies an even bigger tax break, according to The New York Times , costing taxpayers billions in lost revenue.

“Treasury is gutting the new law,” University of Houston tax law professor Bret Wells told the Times. “It is largely the top 1 percent that will disproportionately benefit — the wealthiest people in the world.”

Republicans used budget reconciliation, a congressional process that allowed the Senate to pass the tax cuts with 51 votes instead of 60. But that process requires a bill that will contribute less than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, so Republicans decided to offset the cost of the corporate tax cut by eliminating a wide range of corporate deductions and introducing new taxes.

One of the biggest new taxes was the “base erosion and anti-abuse tax,” or BEAT , which aimed to cut down on foreign companies with large American operations avoiding US taxes by sending their profits to countries with lower tax rates. The other was a provision on “global intangible low-taxed income,” or GILTI , which imposed a tax up to 10.5 percent on some offshore income.

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that these two new taxes would add $262 billion in revenue over the next decade, which the Times noted would be enough to fund the entire Treasury Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Cancer Institute for 10 years.

But the new taxes also featured many loopholes, and “almost immediately” after Trump signed the tax bill, companies launched an aggressive lobbying effort to carve out breaks for themselves in the law, the Times reported.

Chip Harter, a longtime tax attorney who advised companies on how to avoid taxes — before being appointed as the Treasury official in charge of writing rules regarding the new taxes — and his team “found themselves in nonstop meetings — roughly 10 a week at time — with lobbyists” from those companies, according to the Times report. Many of the lobbyists were from the same firms that Harter had previously worked for.

Earlier this month, the department released the final version of some of the BEAT rules that allowed companies to use a “complex currency-accounting maneuver” to avoid paying the tax, according to the Times, giving the lobbyists what they had pushed for.

Foreign banks like Barclays and Credit Suisse also staged an aggressive lobbying effort to carve out an exemption in the BEAT law. The lobbyists included Erika Nijenhuis, who represented the Institute of International Bankers. Harter got Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to approve new exemptions for the banks earlier this year, before the tax office announced even more exemptions. In September, Nijenhuis was appointed to a job at Treasury’s Office of Tax Policy.

Officials at the Joint Committee on Taxation projected that the exemptions for international banks alone would cut revenue by up to $50 billion.

All told, BEAT is only likely to collect “a small fraction” of the $150 billion projection, tax adviser Thomas Horst told the Times.

The department made the moves even as Treasury officials warned Harter that it may lack legal authority to exempt bank payments from the law. Harter dismissed the objections, according to the Times.

“We thoroughly reviewed these issues internally and are fully comfortable that we have the legal authority for the conclusions reached in these regulations,” a Treasury Department spokesperson told the Times.

Companies like Procter & Gamble, News Corp., Comcast, Liberty Mutual and Anheuser-Busch also launched an intense lobbying effort to exempt themselves from GILTI. After months of meetings with lobbyists, the department announced the rules that the companies had pushed for in June."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The Countryside Alliance said the 'sky lanterns' are a menace for landowners who report sheep, cattle and horses being injured or dying from eating their metal frames.

Sarah Lee, Head of Policy at the Countryside Alliance said:

“While Sky lanterns are used to create a spectacle in the sky, they are also a serious danger to the countryside, livestock and wildlife.

""The horrendous news of the Zoo fire in Germany, should remind us all of the very real threat they pose.""

Sky lanterns, also known as Chinese lanterns, consist of a paper-covered wire or bamboo frame and an open flame heat source, which lifts the lantern into the air where it can float for miles from the point of release. Once extinguished the lantern falls back to earth.

Sarah continued:

""Drifting for miles they are a menace for farmers and landowners who frequently report sheep, cattle and horses being injured or even dying from eating the wire metal frames of the lanterns or being spooked by them, on top of the fire hazard they pose.

""Not only that, they are also a serious source of litter in the countryside. We urge people to think twice before letting them off and to consider the impact of them after they have left their hands. If people cannot act responsibly, then firmer action is needed from the Government, which could well result in a ban.”

An estimated 200,000 sky lanterns are sold and released each year in the UK

Sky lanterns also have a open flame to help them fly, which is a fire hazard to wildlife and can damage their habitats and the environment. During the dry summer months, this risk is increased as it's easier for grass and countryside to catch fire.

The RSPCA have also been campaigning against the use of 'sky lanterns' in a bit to end sky litter."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Kenyan soldiers on Thursday killed four suspected Al-Shabaab fighters and captured one after a bus attack in Lamu County.

Coast Regional Coordinator John Elungata gave this report just hours after the ambush in Nyongoro, a notorious place for Al-Shabaab attacks targeted at passenger vehicles and security agencies. Three people were killed while three others were seriously injured when suspected Al-Shabaab militants attacked a bus headed to Lamu from Mombasa.

The terrorists are said to have tried to forcefully stop the bus but the driver sped off, forcing them to spray the bus with bullets. County Commissioner Irungu Macharia said the identity of those killed and injured is yet to be established.

PURSUE ATTACKERS

Security teams were deployed to Nyongoro and the surrounding areas to pursue the attackers.

Transport on the Lamu-Garsen road was disrupted after buses heading to Mombasa from Lamu and vice-versa were directed to return to Witu Police Station.

The Nation also established that an unspecified number of passengers in the bus jumped out of the windows and fled to the nearby bushes after realising that their vehicle was under attack.

Another passenger identified as Omar Yusuf told the Nation that the number of casualties is expected to be higher.

“The bus had more than 40 passengers and was sprayed randomly with bullets. The number of deaths and injuries might be higher,” said Mr Yusuf.

Incidents of suspected Al-Shabaab militants attacking passenger vehicles and security agencies are not new on the Lamu-Mombasa route.

On January 13, 2018, a woman was killed and five police officers injured when a group of heavily armed militants attacked two Administration Police vehicles at Nyongoro area.

The police were escorting a convoy of over five passenger buses from Lamu to Mombasa when the incident occurred. The two police vehicles were burnt.

On July 26, 2018, a police officer was killed and two others injured when their Land Cruiser hit an improvised explosive device before heavily armed militants shot at the vehicle.

FERRIED PRISONERS

The vehicle had ferried prisoners to Hindi GK Prison and was returning to Mpeketoni Police Station when it was attacked at Milihoi area, another notorious place for Al-Shabaab attacks and ambushes.

On July 19, 2014, seven people, including four administration police officers, were killed by Al-Shabaab militants, who ambushed a bus en route to Lamu from Mombasa at Mambo Sasa Forest in Witu.

The bus was sprayed with bullets by the militants, who were hiding in the bush.

As a result, the government imposed a ban on night travel among passenger vehicles plying the Lamu-Mombasa route, a directive which exists up to date.

Buses are also required to travel in a convoy escorted by security agencies. Roadblocks were also mounted on the route.

INCREASED ATTACKS

Passengers plying the route are also required to alight at each of the roadblocks for frisking and police checks in a move aimed at containing security on the road.

The then increased attacks and ambushes on passenger and security vehicles on the Lamu-Garsen route also prompted the government in 2018 to set up GSU camps in all hotspot areas for Al-Shabaab attacks.

Shina Abubakar – Osogbo

Following the attack on the New Year crossover night venue on Wednesday in Osogbo, it was learnt that Police has arrested three suspects in connection with the attack.

It was gathered that while the thugs were disrupting the event and pelting stones at dignitaries, security operatives were trailing some of the thugs.

The three were apprehended by operatives of Operation Puff Adder and taken to the state Police Command.

However, the Police Public Relations Officer, Folasade Odoro disclosed that the suspects were arrested while attempting to disrupt the programme.

In a chat with our correspondent, she said, “During the New Year Eve festivities held at Freedom Park, Osogbo with the State Governor and other dignitaries in attendance.

Some miscreants attempted to mar the exercise at about 1am when His Excellency was about leaving the venue and it was rebuffed by the police Operatives Puff Adder team. However, three suspects were arrested and are helping with investigation”.

Meanwhile, the state All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun in a statement signed by his media consultant, Kola Olabisi disclosed that there is no basis for attack on the Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola.

In the decade from 2010 to 2020, a period in which the Conservative government oversaw the Great Recession and managed the slowest recovery from any economic slump on record – it heaped misery on millions in the shape of a failed policy called austerity.

It doubled the national debt as a percentage of GDP and borrowed over £1trillion to save the banks and the political-economic mismanagement of successive governments. In so doing, it deprived the most vulnerable in society, accelerated child poverty and homelessness and looked the other way over the emerging healthcare crisis and social care crisis. At the same time, well over 100,000 people lost their lives waiting for help. Inequality was expanded, not the economy.

The government offered a protest vote in the form of a referendum and in the end, it led to Brexit, which itself led to a government more right-wing than any for over 200 years. The UKs Union is now seriously at threat as are important international relationships. As the South American saying goes – “if there’s no food for the poor, there’s no rest for the rich.” This is the trajectory of a downward spiral.

In the last decade, we have witnessed more political and financial scandals than any other decade on record; its zenith observed in the fallout of the bank-led financial collapse, the implications of which, are still unfolding.

The next ten years will be worse though. Electoral law, the judicial system and parliament itself will all be ‘reformed’, all for the purpose of providing political and electoral advantages to one political party. Boris Johnson’s government will ruthlessly exploit their win and radically reshape British democracy, ushering in a period of power to last possibly a generation.

With authoritarian tendencies, the Tories, who have only ever dreamed of a victory of this kind, will take this opportunity to entrench what can only be described as Conservative hegemony.

This is evidenced by page 47/48 of the 2019 Tory manifesto, which sees making those dreams become a reality.

The Fixed-term Parliaments Act will be repealed. This allows Johnson the personal right to determine the date of the next general election. Electoral boundaries will be redefined to favour Tory marginals and a voter identification law will be introduced to ensure those who lack photo ID will be unable to vote. The totally outdated ‘first-past-the-post’ voting system is to be protected and the upper house will continue to be a place to shift power.

Boris Johnson, who won just 1 per cent more of the electoral vote than Theresa May did in 2017 – resulted in hers being a disaster but with FPTP his a landslide.

The threats contained in this manifesto are blatantly transmitted and more substantial than anything before it in modern times.

“After Brexit, we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the Government, Parliament and the courts; the functioning of the Royal Prerogative; the role of the House of Lords; and access to justice for ordinary people. The ability of our security services to defend us against terrorism and organised crime is critical. We will update the Human Rights Act and administrative law to ensure that there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government.“

Revenge hides maliciously in the shadows of this paragraph. The saga that unfolded during the Brexit battleground in 2019 is to be dealt with. The Supreme Court, House of Lords and parliament that attempted to halt Brexit will experience game-changing legislation. And when it does – it will be fashioned to ensure enduring power to crush any resistance to its will.

The institutions that have served Britain well over the decades are to be adapted to fit the new order. Dominic Cummings, the man in charge at Downing Street is a dangerous technocrat who has made no secret of his hatred towards Britain’s neutral civil service, towards an independent judiciary, the monarchy, military and government in general. He worships the American administration and authority (without the constitutional obstacles of couse) and their way of life. It says something about our politics when a fifth of all new Tory MPs have worked as lobbyists.

As TruePublica has reported on and warned about so many times, authoritarianism now beckons in this decade of breakdown. And, we are almost helpless in being sucked into its pernicious sphere.

In the UK, liberals have watched in horror as Donald Trump has trampled on the norms of US democracy. He has been impeached as a threat to national security amid claims of corruption and malfeasance. But on this side of the pond, the few mechanisms left to halt the destruction of laws designed to create fairness, balance and impartiality dissipate when the role of the political opposition is vacant. The truth is that the UK is more vulnerable to authoritarianism that America is. Britain’s centralised political model, its unwritten constitution and antiquated electoral system are all gifts to the incumbent government – especially one prepared to break all the rules.

Fake news, ‘deepfake’ video technology, artificial intelligence, surveillance capitalism, social media and other tools of failure will cover us in a blanket of mistrust. It’s the perfect cloak for populists – the dividend of liars.

A British prime minister — with a majority in the House of Commons is almost unrivalled in their power in Europe.

The electorate’s recent habit of returning governments with only small majorities — or no majority at all — had acted as an informal check and balance. But Johnson’s unambiguous triumph has removed even this.

Scotland, one of the few areas to defy Conservative hegemony, may soon secede from the UK. But watch how vindictive this government will be over granting that wish.

Britain’s delicate, unwritten constitution and fragile democratic institutions now face an unprecedented test. And as Labour will soon learn to its cost, election defeats of this nature have consequences. By the time their squabbling is over and they have regrouped, the political, technical and operational landscape of winning elections will have changed.

Supreme Court

There have been calls from Brexiter lawyers and MPs for the appointment of judges to be approved.

Outgoing Supreme Court president Lady Hale – who famously ruled against Mr Johnson’s five-week prorogation of parliament, used her retirement speech last month to warn against the political appointment of senior judges. “Judges have not been appointed for party political reasons in this country since at least the Second World War, we do not want to turn into the Supreme Court of the United States – whether in powers or in process of appointment.”

In a bid to stop cases reaching the Supreme Court – Downing Street has already confirmed a plan to allow lower courts to roll back EU legal rulings following Brexit. This is a plan that prompted concerns that it will become easier to challenge European standards in areas such as workers’ rights and the environment. This distortion of democracy is baked into the new Withdrawal Bill and is seen by many as a way to divert scrutiny and reduce regulatory standards.

Civil Service

Dominic Cummings quickly approaching war on the British civil service is alarming. One insider writes: “He (Cummings) is a shock doctrine aficionado who has seen in Brexit a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ram through policy ideas that couldn’t be implemented at any other time.” Some of those ideas may be good ones. Others, like allowing an increased politicisation of the civil service, are not. The problem with most of his ideas is that they are untested. If they go wrong, they would, according to the civil service union chief, David Penman, “impact upon the delivery of public services to millions of citizens” – an experiment that will could cost lives.

Civil Service World writers published this first paragraph in a dire warning of the immediate future – “After the crepuscular administration of Theresa May, night has descended. Shrouded in gloom, a Prince of Darkness rides. Dominic Cummings is set to become the most influential adviser in British political life. He will be this generation’s svengali; the internet-era Rasputin.”

Monarchy

In 1980, the Queen’s speech was watched by 28 million viewers which reflected and celebrated on the service of people to the state in its many forms. Last year, her speech was watched by 7.1 million people in which she warned that people should respect each other even when they harbour deeply held differences.

In 2019, Professor Robert Hazell of the Constitution Unit branded Johnson’s political plans a “sham” that “embarrassed” the Queen. The proroguing of parliament was a display of political power – not just to the Queen but to all of Johnson’s political adversaries. Relations between the monarchy and government then hit rock bottom.

Prince Andrew has done much to ruin the reputation of the House of Windsor, meanwhile – the right-wing printed media has used the Duchess of Sussex, Megan as their destination of royal ire.

In the next ten years, the Queen will likely become too old to serve and step down. Prince Charles is already 71. What she leaves behind is a monarchy that has been savaged by the right-wing media and subordinated to an unscrupulous authoritarian unphased by tearing down traditions and norms.

Economy

Old claims that Brexit will bring an economic boom have not just been thoroughly rejected by economists, but the drag effect of crashing inward investment is now taking its toll. The UK economy is now entering 2020 with the weakest growth outside a recession since second world war.

This can now be classed as a trend. Economic growth for 2019 as a whole is forecast to be just 1%, the weakest expansion outside a recession for more than half a century. And Johnson’s decision to leave the option of no-deal Brexit on the table will hold back business investment yet again, the impact will continue through the following years.

The only consensus by economists over Brexit is that all forms of Brexit will damage the economy. The only question left – is by how much. With promises to not raise taxes and spend more in an environment of reducing revenue will most likely see the 2019 Tory manifesto turns into a tissue of lies again.

NHS

There is no real consensus amongst economists that Brexit will increase tax revenues – quite the opposite in fact. The Tory manifesto promises no new taxes and in complete contrast to Boris Johnson ’s repeated election campaign denials about selling off, privatising and/or doing a trade deal with America – an exclusive report in The Mirror confirms that – “NHS cancer care and kids’ ­treatments are up for grabs in a stealth Tory sell-off.” Dr John Lister, from Keep Our NHS Public, said: “This is batch privatisation aimed at encouraging NHS trusts to outsource services rather than provide them themselves. This could mean outsourcing whole units or services and transferring staff, or making them redundant.”

Our most detailed report on NHS privatisation from the Centre for Health and the Public Interest proves that privatisation projects now takes up 26 per cent of the NHS budget – not 7 per cent as widely reported. The NHS is already heavily privatised and will continue to be so. The consequence is obvious. NHS services will nor recover and the overall service is once again being set up to fail. Expect no improvements in the NHS but do expect an expansion of private hospitals and related profit-based services that the NHS ends up buying. This is the money extra will go.

Immigration

There’s an unspoken irony here. The new PM has already publicly complained that EU citizens feel ‘too much at home in Britain”. But Britain cannot function without immigration. And so, it will continue.

You can expect immigration to be clamped down upon but don’t expect immigration to fall. Immigration from the EU will fall only to be substantially replaced (after all, according to the government, unemployment is at its lowest). Instead of EU service workers – expect workers from Africa, South America and Asia. The numbers won’t change unless the economy falters or it falters because there are not enough workers.

Age of uncertainty

All of this change will be covered in an era of uncertainty. Fake news, ‘deepfake’ video technology, artificial intelligence, surveillance capitalism, social media and other tools of failure will cover us in a blanket of mistrust. It’s the perfect cloak for populists – the dividend of liars.

Google/YouTube, Facebook/Instagram and Twitter command attention on a truly vast scale and opened political discourse to voices from outside the mainstream media. In so doing, they have done the same to those with nefarious intent, including foreign state powers. Sensational, misleading and fictitious content has been an essential driver of their growth.

According to files leaked by Edward Snowden, the NSA now has effectively unlimited access to data collected by Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Its sister institution in the UK, GCHQ, also conducts massive illegal surveillance of all our online communications. It knows more about your movements and interactions with the world than anyone. All this is now in the hands of a new government with authoritarian tendencies who got into power by lying. This trajectory will see the will of the government exercised over citizen protest groups and dissenters like never before. Soon, we won’t trust much about what we see, hear or read.

Breakdown or reconstruction?

Over the next decade, the political, economic and social landscape of Britain will undoubtedly change but one thing will surely emerge as the truth. By 2030 the schism between the haves and have-nots will have only widened further.

For the haves – Britain will have reconstructed itself in an era of financial failure (2008 crash = austerity) to emerge with extreme advantages provided in a post-Brexit world. For its architects and acolytes, wealth will continue to funnel upwards but with fewer barriers or regulatory obstacles. For the have-nots, social democracy and the institutions that supported it will have withered, and the failure of trickle-down (extreme neoliberal) economics only becomes more visible. Here – the entrenchment of discrimination, injustice and inequality become the definition of the crisis of daily life for half the population and all of the despair that brings with it.

30244,fa266a68e809b12965f8277019f43dbc,"Lower courts reign supreme: So much for the ‘travel ban’

Conservatives continue to entertain false hopes of transforming the judiciary through a “conservative” Supreme Court and through Trump’s appointment of 20 percent of the lower court judges. But the Supreme Court does not rein in lower-court judges, and the Trump administration keeps abiding by district judges’ nationwide injunctions, so the Left continues to gut Trump’s ironclad executive powers, even after he already won at the Supreme Court. The case of the “travel ban” is a perfect example of why Trump should finally delegitimize the entire concept of judicial supremacy rather than trying to beat the Left at its own casino game.

Throughout Trump’s first year in office, we watched one lower court after another create a right to immigrate and demand that the commander in chief surrender his power over sovereignty and national security to the courts. The courts violated 130 years of case law that emphatically concluded courts have no power to grant standing for lawsuits asserting a right to enter the country and that such decisions are exclusively up to the political branches of government. And this administration went along with the charade, even when a Massachusetts judge said its first, stronger, immigration moratorium was totally within the president’s powers.

On June 26, 2018, the “debate” over sovereignty should have come to an end when Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the 5-4 majority in Trump v. Hawaii, ruled that the president has categorical and plenary authority under 8 U.S.C. §1182(f) to exclude anyone he wants. However, on that day, I warned that “until we shut down the lower courts’ terrible practice of placing nationwide injunctions on national security policies, a power they manifestly do not have, the Left will continue shopping these cases to the same capricious lower court judges.” I also warned that experience with other issues has shown that as the lower courts continue chipping away at the original SCOTUS ruling, “the Supreme Court will gradually adopt their approach in the ever-evolving, one-directional ratchet of progressive jurisprudence.”

And here we are today. This AP article shows how a number of foreign nationals from countries on the so-called “travel ban” list – Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen – continue successfully obtaining visas from the administration under the threat of incessant lawsuits. In an interview with a lawyer for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a group named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a terror finance trial by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the AP observed, “When people file litigation, it attracts swift notice from the State Department or the Department of Homeland Security.”

The Trump administration allowed the lower courts to win by watering down the moratorium twice rather than having the Supreme Court rule on the original one. One of the changes in the watered-down version was relinquishing the categorical ban on visas and offering waivers to those who apply for them and claim exigent circumstances. The AP reports that of the 28,100 immigrant visa applications from those countries between December 2017 and Oct. 31, 2019, “11,325 have been deemed qualified for waivers and 16,775 have not.” So much for a “ban,” even on immigration from the very few countries on the list.

Now, groups like CAIR and the ACLU are using this against the administration. Agitation groups are now filing lawsuits and asserting that all these people are entitled to waivers. The AP observes, “The Supreme Court upheld the ban in June 2018, in part because of the promised waiver system that would allow people to come despite the ban if certain criteria were met.” That seems to be the thinking of administration officials based on what lower courts are now doing, but it’s simply not true.

While Roberts mentioned the existence of waivers as one of the factors to swat down arguments of the lower courts and of plaintiffs that the president had acted unlawfully, he offered one all-encompassing reason to uphold the ban without qualification.

The Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. §1182(f)) allows the president “for such period as he shall deem necessary, [to] suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” The Supreme Court already ruled on this in 1993, and Chief Justice John Roberts made it clear that there are no limits to this power. “By its terms, §1182(f) exudes deference to the President in every clause,” wrote Roberts in the majority opinion in Trump v. Hawaii. “It entrusts to the President the decisions whether and when to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, for how long, and on what conditions. It thus vests the President with ‘ample power’ to impose entry restrictions in addition to those elsewhere enumerated in the INA. Sale, 509 U. S., at 187.”

Thus, the issue of waivers is moot because the Trump administration doesn’t have to issue them at all to anyone who is not a citizen. But the hands-off Supreme Court and activist forum-shopped lower court judges are ensuring that victories at the high court are merely formulaic and ultimately meaningless. As I warned at the time, only Justice Thomas made it clear that there is no avenue for anyone to ever get standing in a lawsuit for the right to enter the country as an alien and that there are absolutely no limitations on the president’s power over admission into the country whatsoever. I predicted that absent a five-justice majority built on Thomas’ concurrence, the lower courts would just manipulate the perceived loopholes in the Roberts ruling, despite the general categorical language he used to affirm Trump’s broad power over entry.

And the rest is history. We are left with a slowdown of visas from just a handful of countries, in lieu of the original promise of a moratorium on immigration from the Middle East. All because the administration refuses to assert executive power over visas, even after the SCOTUS ruling.

This is just one issue, but it’s a glimpse into why the Left keeps winning the judicial game. Most victories at the Supreme Court are even more meaningless than the travel ban verdict, because the language is even more ambiguous. Lower-court liberal judges have no shame in going against the Supreme Court. Yet somehow the executive branch feels bound not just to a political opinion of the co-equal Supreme Court, but even to opinions from rogue lower-court judges. Until the administration gets more aggressive, even the most ironclad executive powers will be weakened and the campaign promises that hinge upon them relegated to nothing more than a dream."," Threaten, not specified below",3
30276,b0b48d0dfb087b46eac7869b1585563e,"A day after massive floods hit Jakarta, claiming the lives of at least 23 people, city officials warned residents and tourists more extreme rainfall is expected through the rest of the month and up to at least mid-February 2020.

At least 23 people were killed since heavy rains started on December 31, 2019, and at least 8 are still missing. In Jakarta alone, more than 62 000 people were forced to evacuate while several million lost power, drinking water and internet connections.

On January 2, the Head of the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), Dwikorita Karnawati, warned residents and tourists more extreme rainfall is expected over the next two weeks as the flow of wet air from East Africa reaches the country on January 10 through 15. Furthermore, the movement of wet airflow will also continue in late January to mid-February 2020.

A number of regions that are predicted to be affected by rain with high to extreme intensity according to the BMKG prediction include central Sumatra, Java, southern Kalimantan, and southern Sulawesi to the southeast. Therefore, the community is asked to prepare everything in anticipation of possible disasters.

In an effort to anticipate potential disasters from such extreme weather forecasts, the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology's (BPPT) - Weather Modification Technology Center is ready to help tackle major flooding with Weather Modification Technology (TMC).

BPPT will use TMC to accelerate the process of rainfall in a hope the rain would fall before the clouds reach the capital and surrounding areas.

The plan is to cause the rain in the Sunda Strait or Lambung, but if the wind blows to the east, the rainfall will be directed to dams such as Jatiluhur and Jatigede.

To help the TMC process BPPT together with BNPB and the TNI will deploy 2 types of aircraft -- CN295 and Casa.

According to BPPT, the basic principle behind the technology is prevention through moving rain.

In October 2019, the agency said they have successfully dropped hundreds of cubic meters of rainfall to overcome the widespread forest fires across Kalimantan and Sumatra.

Statistics obtained by the RAC Foundation showed more than 40,000 drivers were caught by officers in 2018/19.

Cumbria came 28th on the list of 39 police forces who provided data.

The county’s police and crime commissioner Peter McCall condemned speeding drivers.

He said: “Speeding is particularly dangerous in Cumbria because most of our roads are single track.

“The message is clear: speeding is not acceptable and it often leads to tragic accidents.

“People need to know that speed limits are there to keep people safe.”

Analysis revealed that speeding accounted for more than four out of five detected motoring offences across the country.

Some 2.39 million drivers were caught speeding in England and Wales in 2018/19, according to a study.

This was a four per cent increase on the previous 12 months and a 37 per cent rise compared with 2011/12.

A total of 2.84 million motoring offences were recorded in 2018/19, meaning speeding accounted for 84 per cent.

The majority (97 per cent) of speeding incidents involved drivers being caught by camera.

Researchers suggested variations across forces were partly due to geographical area, road type, traffic volume and local policing priorities. Government figures show 186 people were killed and 1,505 seriously injured on Britain’s roads in 2018."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

30458,49d49da00d17d90cbc6ff1857246c6ba,"Some Democrats got upset about this answer, but I think that’s a naïve response. If Biden showed any real inclination to pick a Republican vice president — as opposed to talking idly about doing so — I’d understand why people would be upset. Until then, Vox’s Ezra Klein offered some good perspective, in a series of tweets:

The degree to which this web site [Twitter] takes everything Biden says literally, as opposed to politically, is odd. He’s not going to choose a Republican VP. He thinks it’s good politics to signal that he’ll work with Republicans if they’ll meet him halfway. He’s probably right.

To put this differently: what makes it likelier that Democrats win the Senate race in Arizona and keep the seat in Alabama? A nominee who bends over backwards to signal his respect for wavering Republicans? Or one who antagonizes them?

When Biden says stuff like this, it’s a low-cost way of trying to appeal to 1) the small group of GOP-leaning voters who are persuadable and 2) the much larger group of voters who hate how bitter and angry politics has become.

Authorities say they were called out to a crash in Victor, New York, around 10:30 p.m. New Year's Eve, where a vehicle had crashed into a ditch. There, deputies found Brian Kolb, who has represented his district located outside Rochester for the last twenty years, to be the driver of the 2018 GMC Acadia that had crashed in front of the state lawmaker's home.

A deputy with the Ontario County Sheriff's office performed field sobriety tests, which Kolb failed. At the jail, Kolb's blood-alcohol content was over the legal limit of 0.08 percent, Ontario County Sheriff Kevin Henderson said.

No one else was injured in the accident, authorities said.

Kolb acknowledged his arrest in a a brief statement on Wednesday, saying there was no excuse.

""I fully recognize the severity of the situation and I am profoundly sorry,"" Kolb said. ""There is no excuse and no justification for what occurred Tuesday evening. I made the wrong decision, and it is one I deeply regret.""

""This was a terrible lapse in judgment, one I have urged others not to make, and I take full responsibility for it,"" he added.

Only a week before his arrest, Kolb authored a column that appeared in a local newspaper that warned against drivers taking the wheel when they've been driving and that it was an especially bad decision during the holidays, writing that: ""tragedy can be only one bad decision away.""

Kolb has been charged with driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor, and released pending a future court appearance.

The schools were supposed to reopen after the asbestos was detected late last year.

The asbestos was found in pipe insulation

Two Philadelphia schools that were supposed to reopen in the new year will instead remain closed due to asbestos.

Alexander K. McClure Elementary School on 600 W. Hunting Park Avenue as well as Laura H. Carnell Elementary School on 1100 Devereaux Avenue will be closed Thursday and Friday out of an “abundance of caution,” the Philadelphia School District announced.

Officials said asbestos was discovered in pipe insulation inside both buildings. A spokesperson for the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers also wrote that asbestos was found in multiple areas in the building at Carnell Elementary.

“Included in the observed hazards are crushed asbestos tiles in a maintenance closet and a staff bathroom containing severely damaged and unsafe asbestos insulation,” the PFT spokesperson wrote. “In addition, imminent hazards were discovered in at least one classroom, to the point that our environmental scientist was unable to fully complete his evaluation, as he needed a protective respirator to do so.”

Asbestos in Philadelphia schools kept some students from returning to class today. Parents are demanding change from the school district to put an end to these issues. NBC10’s Stephanía Jiménez was at Roberto Clemente Middle School to speak with some concerned parents.

Cleaning, abatement work and air quality testing are taking place in both buildings before students and staff are allowed back in.

Asbestos was n ongoing issue for Philadelphia schools in 2019. Pratt Head Start on North 22nd Street was closed in November while Benjamin Franklin High School and Science Leadership Academy, which share a building on North Broad Street, were closed in September.

School district officials announced they were using at least $12 million in operating funds and $500 million in capital funding to alleviate issues like asbestos and lead paint in 141 of its aging buildings. About 86,000 young people will be affected by the ""Healthy Schools"" environmental plan, the district said.

Asbestos is a fibrous material that was commonly used in commercial products such as installation and fire proofing for decades, according to The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

When inhaled, the microscopic particles from asbestos can cause life-threatening diseases including lung cancer and mesothelioma, the NIOSH says.

Dr. Theodore Karasik

Short Url https://arab.news/gbrjx

As we enter the third decade of the 21st century, measles, a deadly disease, is back because of foolhardy beliefs regarding the requirement for vaccination.

Over the last 10 years, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases have been reported in developed countries around the world. In particular, measles outbreaks have been ongoing in the EU since 2017, with the majority of cases concentrated in Romania and Italy.

Measles has been identified as a powerful indicator of the status of vaccination programs in a region, as outbreaks have been reported to quickly emerge as a result of underlying issues in immunization routines because of local belief systems due to poor educational reach.

It is important to consider the psychological, cultural, social and political causes of vaccine hesitancy and refusal reasons among some populations in rejecting or avoiding treatment programs.

Measles, also known as rubeola, is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, with at least a 90 percent secondary infection rate in susceptible domestic contacts. Despite being considered primarily a childhood illness, measles can affect people of all ages.

The viral illness infected nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killed 140,000, mostly children, as devastating outbreaks hit every region of the world even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine was available.

Today, there are an estimated 21 million unvaccinated infants globally, half of whom are in five countries: Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan.

Although measles vaccination resulted in a 73 percent drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2018 worldwide, in 2018, about 86 percent of the world’s children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday through routine health services — up from 72 percent in 2000.

Between 2000 and 2018, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 23.2 million deaths, making the vaccine a success in public health goals. So, progress against measles has been made over the past decade but now we are entering a period of time where anti-vaccination sentiment, influenced by quack scientific design, could affect that progress.

Measles and its spread can be controlled on a global level and world health specialists are not the only practitioners focusing their efforts on raising public awareness and delivering vaccines to communities. Dr. Theodore Karasik

But there is a catch that makes measles a health security issue: According to public health specialists, with each cohort of children born to parents who distrust or fear vaccines, the number of people susceptible to the measles virus expands. Simultaneously, there is a growing population of adults who were children in the early days of measles vaccination whose immunity may have worn off. Where these age groups merge is where the transmission spread of the disease becomes confluent.

The phenomena of avoiding vaccination in Western countries is of negative consequence and the implications for public health issues is one of frustration and dismay.

To be sure, measles cases are on the rise globally, including in wealthy nations such as the US and Germany, as some parents shun life-saving vaccines due to extraordinary false theories suggesting links between childhood immunizations and autism, plus other maladies.

The false literature countering such interpretations regarding vaccine against measles is replete with errors in judgment and scientific, fact-driven metrics. That means fake findings, and thus a phenomenon that is being manipulated by well-placed dissemination of the worst form of information warfare: Ignorance.

Consequently, there are infections occurring at increasing rates that are causing cases to pop up and affect wide communities where public health becomes a security issue and ultimately affects society and economy.

In April 2019, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency because of an ongoing measles outbreak. The mandatory immunization extended to anyone who lived, worked or went to school within zip codes assigned to a specific neighborhood in Brooklyn. This example of action by city officials was an important marker of response to an urban disease contagion.

The island nation of Samoa recently experienced a measles disaster that stood out as an example of the illness running amok in a country where vaccination rates were not high enough.

The state was ravaged by the disease that killed 81 people, mostly babies and young children, and affected more than 5,600 others. The Samoan outbreak came from New Zealand, a hub for travel to and from the South Pacific islands, the disease finding a highly susceptible population in Samoa which had far lower vaccination rates than its other island neighbors.

A robust action program saw school closures and travel restrictions among measures to control the outbreak. If there had ever been a test sample of how a geographical area could be infected with a contagion, this was it.

There is no doubt that without sustained attention, hard fought gains can easily be lost in the struggle to wipe out measles.

Where children are unvaccinated, outbreaks occur. Because of low coverage nationally or in pockets, multiple regions were hit with large measles outbreaks in 2018, causing many deaths. The conclusion by the World Health Organization’s strategic advisory group of experts on immunization that measles elimination was greatly under threat because of disease resurgence in a number of countries that achieved disease elimination, illustrated the return of the disease as a vector threat.

Given the continuous nature of the disease, modes of transport such as planes can become primary transition belts along with confined spaces including offices and commercial locations. Quickly identifying ill passengers or asking non-invasive questions based on their travel is an important part of mapping disease spread.

Overall, measles and its spread can be controlled on a global level and world health specialists are not the only practitioners focusing their efforts on raising public awareness and delivering vaccines to communities.

The security implications of whole communities becoming infected is one to be taken more seriously, as demonstrated in cases around the globe. Samoa’s six-week state of emergency was a case in point for better understanding responses to future outbreaks.

30925,9a9148ba69627c49081688eaf53f56e8,"“Anti-Semitism is not a thing of the past, it has a future [in Europe],” says French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut.

By United with Israel Staff

French-Jewish philosopher and recognized public intellectual Alain Finkielkraut issued a stern warning concerning rapidly rising anti-Semitism worldwide in an interview with the German Der Spiegel magazine that was recently published.

“Anti-Semitism is not a thing of the past, it even has a future,” Finkielkraut said. “I was actually the object of aggression that had a proven anti-Semitic character. I was not called ‘dirty Jew’ but ‘dirty s*** Zionist’.”

Finkielkraut was on the receiving end of anti-Semitic abuse hurled at him by “yellow vest” demonstrators in February. The yellow vests are part of a left-wing French protest group that seeks “economic justice.”

He said that “contemporary anti-Semitism uses the language of anti-racism. Because of the existence of Israel, the Jews are now considered racists.”

The philosopher emphasized the “worrying” situation with the “extreme left [that] defends radical, anti-Semitic Islam.” He pointed out two reasons for his concern.

“[I]deologically, because for them the Muslims are the new Jews, the disenfranchised, but also for tactical reasons, because there are many more Muslims than Jews in France today,” he told der Spiegel.

Finkielkraut continued, “Hatred of the Jews is very widespread in the Arab countries. Germany has recently opened its doors wide to a large number of immigrants from these countries. Germany is therefore already encountering a different, new anti-Semitism.”

He said that western Europe is “haunted” by Nazism and the Holocaust. This “blinds us to the reality of the present. We are so obsessed with the fear that our lap is still fertile and the beast can escape from it again, that we do not recognize the new forms of anti-Semitism. And, when we recognize them, we underestimate them.”

He did share a ray of hope, however, “Fortunately, we are mobilizing against anti-Semitism that stems from the neo-Nazi milieu. You can find it in Alsace, in Germany, in Italy.”

The victims are now living in churches, schools, hospitals and host families, who are finding it hard to feed and cater for all their needs.

Mr George Nambale, the Shikhururwe Village chairperson, said most victims lost all their properties.

Mr Nambale said due to the overwhelming burden that victims put onto the host families, others have sought to return to their homes, putting their lives in more danger.

""Victims have no food, beddings, materials, clothing to use and this is putting them at much greater risk of getting diseases such as malaria,"" he said.

Ms Lorna Watsemwa, 44, a mother of seven, said life has been hard for her.

""I fled my home after the landslide. Now I have nowhere to go and nothing to eat thus this has forced me to go back to my home and die from there because I am finding it hard to continue begging for help people yet I have a big family,"" Ms Watsemwa said.

Multiple landslides occurred early this month in Sironko and Bududa districts, killing more than 50 people and displacing hundreds.

In a bid to mitigate the plight of the survivors and victims, Uganda Red Cross has delivered a consignment of non-food items such as utensils, beddings, tarpaulins and jerrycans.

Mr Ibrahim Ssenyonga, a national disaster response officer from the Uganda Red Cross, cautioned victims not to sell the relief items.

""The hills here are so fragile, cracks are almost everywhere and this presents more risk to those who are still living in the hills. The best approach to this relocation plan is government to set a resettlement package that would enable these people buy land elsewhere that is safer,"" said Mr Ssenyonga.

He added that their delayed response to the victims was due to inadequate funds and the over whelming disasters all over the country that have stretched them a lot.

Mr Wilson Watila, the Bududa District chairperson, said more support is needed.

Mr Watila also said reactive interventions need to be stopped, adding that government needs to look for a lasting solution for the calamities.

""The calamities are not stopping today in Bududa thus government needs to speed up the resettlement process by using different methods other than relying on building houses which is too slow compared to the rate of disaster every year,"" he said.

Meanwhile, non-food items were also offered to 540 families in Butaleja District that were also ravaged by the floods on December 4.

And some of these items include bedding, utensils, jerrycans and tarpaulins.

Women helped. Mr Frances Amulen, an official at the Red cross of Tororo branch, said special package of menstruation health management kits were also given to 460 women. They consisted of pads, soap, towels, buckets and knickers.

France said in most case women in Butaleja have been neglected by their husbands due to poor management of menstruation hygiene."," Threaten, not specified below",3

MADISON - A group of voters asked a judge Thursday to find state election officials in contempt of court — and charge them as much as $12,000 a day — because they haven't removed thousands of people from the voter rolls.

Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy last month determined state law required the Wisconsin Elections Commission to quickly take off the rolls those who it believes may have moved.

The commission, which consists of three Republicans and three Democrats, is pursuing an appeal but has deadlocked on whether to take voters off the rolls in the meantime.

""Because of the failure of the commission to comply with an existing court order, we have no choice but to file a motion to have the agency held in contempt of court,"" Rick Esenberg, the president of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, said Thursday on WISN-AM (1130).

""Court orders are not suggestions and they’re not rendered inoperative by the fact that you’ve filed an appeal.""

Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, who represents the commission, said the state agency should not be found in contempt because both sides are asking higher courts to review Malloy's decision on the voter rolls.

""This case should not effectively be ended before the appeals process plays out,"" Kaul said in a statement.

Esenberg's group brought its lawsuit on behalf of three voters from suburban Milwaukee — Frederick Luehrs III, David Opitz and Timothy Zignego. Opitz is a former state lawmaker and former chairman of the state Republican Party. Zignego runs a road construction company and is a frequent donor to GOP candidates. Luehrs is a maintenance manager who has not made political donations in Wisconsin, according to state and federal campaign finance records.

In his motion, Esenberg asked Malloy to charge the commission and five of its members $2,000 per day for defying his order. Malloy has scheduled a Jan. 13 hearing on the request.

""It is obvious that the defendants do not intend to take any action to comply with this court’s order,"" Esenberg wrote.

The lawsuit and contempt request doesn't name the sixth member of the commission, Robert Spindell, because he wasn't on the commission when it made its decisions about how to handle the voter rolls. Spindell encouraged WILL to file its lawsuit over the rolls before he was appointed to the commission by state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. R-Juneau.

The commission most recently deadlocked Monday, when the commissioners split along party lines over whether to begin the process of taking more than 100,000 voters off the rolls.

Ann Jacobs, a Democrat on the commission, said after the vote she did not believe the commission was in danger of being found in contempt of court because the judge hadn't given the commission a deadline for when to act.

""Judge Malloy’s order says only (to) comply with the statute,"" Jacobs said Monday. ""It doesn’t say how and in fact in his oral ruling he says — and I’m paraphrasing — he says it’s up to the Elections Commission to figure out how to do to this. The order itself doesn’t have a date.""

The commission in October sent letters to more than 230,000 voters who it believes may have moved because they provided new addresses to the post office, state Division of Motor Vehicles or other government agencies.

The commission asked the voters to update their voter registrations or confirm they were still at the same address. At the time, it planned to remove people from the voter rolls in 2021 if they didn't act.

But conservatives argued the commission had to act much faster and Malloy agreed, saying it was required to take people off the rolls 30 days after sending the letters if the voters had not yet acted.

RELATED: A judge ordered the state to purge more than 200,000 voters from the rolls. What should I do if I'm one of them?

The commission has asked an appeals court to review the decision. WILL has asked the state Supreme Court to take up the case without waiting to hear from the appeals court.

Unclear is exactly how many voters could be taken off the rolls.

The commission sent letters to about 232,500 voters. But this week election officials said about an estimated 88,000 of those voters are believed to have moved within the same municipality. State law provides for removing people from the rolls if they move from one community to another, but not if they move within that community.

Malloy's order didn't address that issue. Democrats have cited that issue as one reason for not taking people off the rolls

""Judge Malloy’s decision is clearly incorrect and overbroad in that regard,"" Democratic commissioner Mark Thomsen said Monday.

Elections officials sent the letters based on information compiled by the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, a coalition of 28 states and Washington, D.C., that tries to keep voter rolls as accurate as possible. ERIC checks government databases to develop evidence that people have moved, but in some cases voters are wrongly flagged, such as when a voter who has not moved registers a vehicle at a business address.

Voters who are removed from the voter rolls, whether correctly or mistakenly, can regain the ability to cast ballots by re-registering online, at their clerk's office or at the polls on election day.

In addition to the lawsuit in state court, there is one in federal court brought by the liberal League of Women Voters, which wants to keep people on the rolls.

Those who brought the lawsuit in state court asked Thursday to intervene in the federal case so they could argue it should be thrown out. They contended in their filing that the federal lawsuit should be dismissed because the state case is already underway.

With two lawsuits, there is a possibility the state and federal courts could issue contradictory decisions.

31092,2b687968e73f943cc745c15490c1fd38,"C HINA IS THE land of face recognition. Cameras able to extract face prints from passers-by are common in the streets of large cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Boxy vending machines at airports offer to let you pay for a cup of orange juice, robot-squeezed for perfect freshness, by scanning your face. From December 1st all people applying for an account with one of China’s telecoms companies such as China Mobile must have their face scanned. Previous regulations required proof of identity, but the possession of users’ face prints will let firms verify identities in real-time via smartphone cameras.

Considering the oppressive purposes to which this technology is being put—most notably in the Muslim-majority areas of north-west China—it would not be appropriate to call China’s rapid adoption of it anything more than a technical success. The underappreciated fact that companies leaping ahead in the field are more reliant on cleverly deployed cheap labour for their progress than on any technological edge, suggests another reason for caution before declaring a Chinese victory in the tech wars. But understanding how China has got face recognition to flourish is nonetheless instructive. Two of the world’s most valuable startups, Megvii and SenseTime, worth $4bn and $7.5bn respectively, are Chinese AI companies specialising in the field. Their application of it alone would make it one of the most widely deployed forms of artificial intelligence in the world.

Like most companies deploying intelligent software, Megvii and SenseTime rely on a technique called machine learning. They do not ask their human coders to program computers with rules that distinguish between one face and another. Instead the coders provide the computer with masses of data about faces, usually photographs, and write software which trawls through those photos looking for patterns which can be used reliably to tell one unique face from another. The patterns picked up by that learning software make better rules for recognising faces than anything a human coder could describe explicitly. Humans are good at recognising faces but, with the right software, computers can learn to be much better. Face-recognition software is much easier and cheaper to deploy than human recognisers. It just needs software, powerful computers and data—the new trinity of AI .

It is in the third of those categories, people will warn you, that China’s great advantage lies. It has loads of data. But its advantage is subtler than that. Data alone are not much use for building AI software. They must first be labelled. This means that the data set must be endowed with the contextual information that computers need in order to learn statistical associations between components of that data set and their meaning to human beings.

To learn to differentiate between cats and dogs, a computer is first shown pictures in which each animal is correctly labelled. To learn to distinguish between one person’s face and another, a computer must first be shown what a face is, using labelled data, and then how to tell the difference between cheekbones and brows, again via human labelling. Only with enough labelled instructions will it be able to start recognising faces without human help.

Underpinning companies like Megvii and SenseTime is a sprawling digital infrastructure through which data are collected, cleaned and labelled before being processed into the machine-learning software that makes face recognition tick. Just as Apple adds its brand to phones mostly assembled by cheap Chinese labour, so too the Chinese AI companies design and brand AI software and services which sit atop a data supply chain using cheap labour at Chinese data factories no one has ever heard of. Megvii has spent 218m yuan ($31m) on labelled data in the past three and a half years, according to its IPO prospectus. Many of the algorithms used contain little that is not available to any computer-science graduate student on Earth. Without China’s data-labelling infrastructure, which is without peer, they would be nowhere.

Charles Liu is the founder of one of China’s largest data factories, known in English by the initials MBH. He employs 300,000 data labellers across China’s poorest provinces. Each labeller works a six-hour shift each day, tagging a stream of faces, medical imagery and cityscapes. MBH pushes a stream of data to them as if on a digital conveyor belt, and they churn through it, creating the syllabus from which machines learn. They can turn it off to take a bathroom break, but that is the extent of their control. They do not choose which data to label but have them chosen for them.

Mr Liu claims that MBH ’s trick is not just numbers, but the methods the firm uses to distribute labelling work efficiently to its workers. This is done using the same kind of machine-learning systems that Amazon, an American e-commerce giant, uses to recommend products to its customers. Instead of suggesting stuff to shoppers, MBH assigns labelling tasks to workers. First, it gathers data from its workers as they carry out labelling jobs. Mr Liu says the company records its workers’ gaze, mouse movements and keyboard strokes. It also takes note of what sort of data-labelling task the worker is performing, from medical-imagery labelling to text translation. By measuring performance according to the type of task, he says, he is able to find workers who are better at some tasks than others, and steer those tasks to those workers.

All of this happens automatically as MBH ’s customers feed tasks into the company. At its most finely tuned, Mr Liu says these systems let his army of workers classify data almost in real time. In work for TikTok, a popular short-form video app owned by ByteDance, a company based in Beijing, he says MBH ’s data labellers handle imagery which TikTok’s automated system cannot be sure is not pornographic. MBH shows the putative porn to hundreds or thousands of human workers who, like Justice Potter Stewart, know it when they see it. The company then returns their aggregated answer to TikTok in less than a second.

AI arbitrage

For their efforts, MBH ’s workers are paid an average salary of 3,000 yuan ($425) per month, three times more than the average worker in China’s poorest regions. Mr Liu can deploy wage arbitrage between the richest and poorest places, using the internet. In many ways MBH ’s business works like Uber, a ride-hailing firm, as a crowdsourcing platform connecting supply of labour with demand. But the minimum wage that Uber can reasonably expect its drivers to take home is constrained by geography, as its drivers must live within a few hours of their markets. This restricts them to urban areas with high living costs, putting a lower bound on even the stingiest wage. Mr Liu suffers no such constraints. Workers from areas in which 3,000 yuan per month is a fine wage can happily label data for AI companies in Shenzhen, where it is not.

Many provincial governments are keen to get Mr Liu to open a data factory in their region and offer much-needed jobs. For every 5,000 workers MBH employs in a given month, local governments pay the firm 50,000 yuan. Across all 300,000 workers that adds up to 3m yuan ($425,000) in government money every month.

Mr Liu says that his firm sees fewer and fewer face-recognition labelling tasks these days compared with the boom of 2017. Increasingly common now are labelling requests for medical imagery from which software can learn to diagnose disease. There are also endless streetscapes which, once labelled, can teach autonomous cars about the cities they must navigate. Those are more difficult labelling tasks. Whereas every human knows what a face looks like, not everyone understands what a tumour looks like in an X -ray. Labelling such conditions requires specialist knowledge, and means that MBH must pay its labellers more money. Still, those labelling requests are indicative of the kinds of AI service that may reach widespread adoption in China in a few years’ time. Mr Liu says he will expand his workforce by 50% next year.

Without this data-labelling infrastructure, China’s AI services would not have taken off. Labelling services like MBH are what have allowed Alibaba to create a powerful machine-learning service like Taobao’s image-based product search. An Alibaba shopper can take a photo of an item in a shop window and immediately be steered to a page where they can purchase it. Alibaba processes a billion images like this a day. It also relies on labelled data for the machine-learning algorithms that are used in its retail stores, which operate under the brand Hema. Cameras installed throughout the glitzy new supermarkets track shoppers around the store and identify the products they take off the shelves."," Threaten, not specified below",3

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A United Nations official says the continued incarceration of former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning for her refusal to testify to a grand jury amounts to torture.

Nils Melzer, the U.N.'s special rapporteur on torture, released the letter to U.S. officials in support of Manning on Thursday.

Manning was subpoenaed last year to testify to a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks, but she says she opposes the grand jury system on general principle and won't testify.

A judge ordered that Manning be jailed for up to 18 months unless she changes her mind and agrees to testify. He also imposed fines of up to $1,000 per day.

Melzer stated in his letter that coercive jail sentences like those imposed on Manning amount to torture under international law and called for Manning's release.

Prosecutors and the judge have said that Manning faces the same obligations as all citizens to comply with lawful subpoenas and that she can end her jail term at any time by agreeing to testify.

Manning served seven years in a military prison for leaking a trove of documents to WikiLeaks before then-President Barack Obama commuted the remainder of her 35-year sentence in 2017.

Lady luck can play a cruel hand. In 2019 Ricky Brabec was odds on to take victory at the Dakar Rally before an engine failure on his factory Honda took him out the event.

Poised again as one of the potential winners of the biggest race in off road sport, Brabec begins the 2020 Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia on January 5 with a score to settle.

In this interview Brabec explains how that 2019 retirement affected him, what he would have done differently and what to expect from the 2020 Dakar…

How are you feeling physically and how are the preparations for the next Dakar going? What are you expecting from it?

“Physically, I feel really good. Mentally, I’m still working on it. I had a tough break in the 2019 Dakar and it was pretty hard getting back in the saddle and pushing for victory after that one. There’s a lot of emotions and mixed feelings.

“But unfortunately what is done is done. So now we have to push and hopefully gain the confidence and the speed back as we head into the Dakar 2020 with more confidence and hopefully with a bit more speed. We will keep the fight alive and show up in Saudi Arabia Dakar ready for a full-on fight.”

Last Dakar you took a huge step and you were leading the rally up until a few days from the finish. In the next Dakar you will be one of the favourites for the victory.

“Being one of the favourites is cool, but there’s a lot of people that think that if they are favourite, they’ll have a lot of ‘water-boys’ supporting them, but for me, coming from America, we do things a lot differently.

“I’m not expecting other riders to ride for me and I’m not going to ride for other riders. We are all in the race together. We are all trying to win. But in the end, when one of our team-mates wins, yeah, that guy won, but the whole team also wins. I’m really big at being a fair player. For me I will do the best I can at the Dakar. Hopefully I can come out on top and make all my friends and family proud.”

Is it better to start the race as one of the favourites or one of those in the background?

“To start as a favourite I think you might have a lot of weight on your shoulders because everyone is watching you. But I prefer to start as an underdog and then come in and show people ‘Hey! Here I am.’

“There are about fifteen riders who could win the rally, so it’s not easy and we are not going very slow. Every day anything can happen and everything changes. The idea is to put in a really good first stage and start the rally on a good note. Hopefully the organization plays it safe. It’s rally. Everything changes. Every kilometre. What really matters is who crosses the line first.”

The rally will change this year as they will give you the roadbook in the morning. You’ve already experienced this in Morocco. How will the race change with this rule?

“We will get pre-painted roadbooks. On four or six days we will get the roadbook in the morning. It definitely slows the rally down and makes the riders think a bit more. We won’t just look down and see the colours as usual and know what we are going to do. It’ll be more equal.

“You don’t want to be really far up front or really far back, you always want to be conservative and consistent and right in the middle: if you start at the front, then you are going to be the first one opening with a roadbook that nobody has seen. That can cause a lot of lost time.

“You want to finish fifth to tenth everyday, that will make you do really well: you won’t lose a lot of time, but you won’t gain a lot of time. You’ll always be in the fight. So you come in on the last day and attack.

“I’m training with the new roadbook at my house as best I can. Hopefully I can come into the Dakar with a lot of experience of the new roadbook and be more comfortable when I get there.”

Saudi Arabia is a new country, so for this year all the riders arrive under the same conditions…

“We’re going to a different country, to Saudi Arabia, so no-one is familiar with the country and no-one has any insight into the route. We’re all going in pretty equal, not knowing what the heck is going on. It’s going be fairer.

“You know, it’s not going to be like, ‘Hey I know a guy that says that here is like this or whatever.’ We are all going in basically blind. We go to Peru, we go to Argentina, we go to Bolivia, we go to Morocco, we go to Dubai and we can go to Chile and we already know what each day is going to be like by looking where we’re going or by what they’re telling us.

“This time we are going to Saudi Arabia where we haven’t raced before. The new generation hasn’t raced there. So we are going to start not knowing anything. They are going to tell us what the stage is like and that’s all we are going to know. So it’s going to be fairer. All the riders get the same roadbook, at the same time of the day. I think the rally is going to come down to not just speed, but being smart and being collective.”

Could this be good for you?

“Hopefully. We’ll see at the end of the Dakar.”

You are an American and you live in California. If you go back to when you first went to dirt races or desert races, did you ever imagine that one day you would be leading the Dakar Rally, the toughest race in the world?

“I would have done a lot of things differently had I known I would be where I am at today. I probably would have paid attention better in math class at school. I would probably have fewer tattoos… I probably wouldn’t have grown up as a punk kid… I don’t know. I never thought that I’d be leading the Dakar, but in 2019 I was doing that, and I believe that there’s a little fight left in me to do it for 2020.”

When you started to ride, did you know about the Dakar?

“No. I didn’t know about the Dakar until 2008. One of my friends came to watch the Dakar. I was watching Quinn Cody and Robby Gordon.”

Off the Rally bike, your normal training is with a bicycle?

“I ride a bicycle, I ride a mountain bike, I do some downhill… I go to the gym, some motocross track. Hiking… I do a lot of things because I hate to sit still and I hate to sit inside and I hate to watch TV. So I try to do something whether it’s playing in the truck or riding trails, riding Enduro, mountain biking, going to the downhill mountain bike park to go jumping with the bicycle, hiking with friends, camping…”

Is there any race similar to the terrain that you are used to?

“The terrain near my house is like Morocco. Really rough and really dry. We have many dunes near my home where I do my training and the Baja 1000 is very close to my house. It’s exactly like Morocco. Hopefully it will be like Saudi Arabia, so I will feel comfortable.

Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.

With every new year, I typically set aside some time to write down what I’m grateful for. Health, family, friends, books, jazz, my dog, among other things. This year I added something I’ve been taking for granted. It’s democracy.



Like many of us, I have worried about the rising tide of rightwing populism, nationalism and polarisation across the world. Within just a few years, we’ve witnessed the election of Donald Trump in the US, the Brexit decision in the UK, the rise of Matteo Salvini in Italy, Victor Orbán in Hungary, the Freedom party in Austria and the Law and Justice party in Poland. The world’s largest democracy, India, is menaced by a newly virulent nationalism and xenophobia.

For a long time I wondered what explained the appeal of these apparently fringe movements that, in my view, had accidentally gone mainstream. They seemed like the exception to a general rule of progression towards, not away from, democratic norms. But this year I came to a different conclusion: it’s democracy that is a precious exception to the rule, and one that is extremely fragile, for a simple reason: the human craving for order and security when chaos feels imminent.

The philosopher and psychologist Erich Fromm first identified this predicament in his 1941 book Escape From Freedom. The gist of it is this: when people perceive an increase in disorder, they feel tremendous anxiety. Inevitably, this anxiety leads to a quest for security. To bring a sense of safety back into their lives, they latch on to authoritarianism and conformity. As Fromm noted, this often leads to “a readiness to accept any ideology and any leader if only he offers a political structure and symbols which allegedly give meaning and order to an individual’s life”. He had observed this in Germany, which he fled in 1933: “Modern man still is anxious and tempted to surrender his freedom to dictators of all kinds,” he wrote.

Fromm was speculating about this dynamic. But decades later, I and other psychologists have empirically shown how insecurity is linked to the rise of autocrats and the erosion of democracy. In a survey we conducted before the 2016 US presidential election, for example, we asked US residents questions about how fearful they were about various threats, such as illegal immigration, a lack of jobs, crime, terrorism, an attack from Iran, among others. They also responded to statements aimed at gauging their desire for stricter rules and their support for different political candidates, including Trump. We conducted the same survey in 2017 in France, measuring support for Marine Le Pen.



The results of both studies were telling: people who felt threatened wanted to tighten up – to have stricter rules – which predicted their support for Trump or Le Pen in the US and France, respectively. Other research confirms the same pattern. Economic threats and the growing gap between the rich and poor also create a sense of chaos and instability. This has led to increased support for strong leaders willing to challenge democratic values and practices.

It’s a simple principle, one that is causing democracies all around the world to unravel. When people experience threat – whether actual or imagined – they begin to “tighten”. In physical terms, they tense their muscles, ready to defend themselves. In political terms, they begin to crave security and order in a community that seems to be collapsing. Authoritarian leaders satiate this need by promising quick, simple solutions – and, above all, a return to the tighter social order of yesteryear.

Leaders are aware of this basic psychology and exaggerate threats to gain popularity. Trump did so masterfully: at campaign rallies throughout 2015 and 2016, he warned his ever-growing crowds that the US was a nation on the “brink of disaster”. He cited Mexicans supposedly bringing violence across the border, global trade agreements and immigrants taking away jobs, and radicalised Muslims plotting terror on American soil. Throughout his campaign, he sent the clear message that he was capable of restoring social order: “I alone can fix it.” Analysing campaign speeches, we found that Trump used far more threatening language than Hillary Clinton.

To strengthen democracy, we’re going to have to deal with this threat psychology. Some of the threats, such as the loss of well-paid, secure employment, are real. We need to empathise with those who are struggling – rather than dismissing their fears – and develop innovative solutions, particularly for those put out of work by the decline of manufacturing amid the AI revolution.



But other threats are exaggerated and, unfortunately, they produce the same tightening and hostility. For example, in our studies, we’ve found that Americans greatly overestimate the percentage of people who immigrated illegally. (Republicans estimated that 18% of the US population is made up of people who are here illegally, while Democrats estimated that statistic to be less than 13%, on average. The actual figure, according to a 2017 Pew Research study, is closer to 3%.) The greater the misperception, the more people said they would vote for Trump in 2020. Ironically, many real threats – including violence and disease – have declined precipitously over the years, but manufactured or imaginary threats still persist.

Now more than ever, we need to develop ways to counter the misperceptions that are beginning to upend democracies. We can’t take those fragile political arrangements for granted. It is not primarily a question of weeding out particular personalities or reversing regrettable decisions, but addressing the things that made them attractive in the first place: that pervasive sense of rising threat.

31414,b239f0601e96d5283d1265cae129a0a2,"With every new year, I typically set aside some time to write down what I’m grateful for. Health, family, friends, books, jazz, my dog, among other things. This year I added something I’ve been taking for granted. It’s democracy.

Like many of us, I have worried about the rising tide of rightwing populism, nationalism and polarisation across the world. Within just a few years, we’ve witnessed the election of Donald Trump in the US, the Brexit decision in the UK, the rise of Matteo Salvini in Italy, Victor Orbán in Hungary, the Freedom party in Austria and the Law and Justice party in Poland. The world’s largest democracy, India, is menaced by a newly virulent nationalism and xenophobia.

For a long time I wondered what explained the appeal of these apparently fringe movements that, in my view, had accidentally gone mainstream. They seemed like the exception to a general rule of progression towards, not away from, democratic norms. But this year I came to a different conclusion: it’s democracy that is a precious exception to the rule, and one that is extremely fragile, for a simple reason: the human craving for order and security when chaos feels imminent.

Centrist Democrats need a 2020 reality check before it's too late | Cas Mudde Read more

The philosopher and psychologist Erich Fromm first identified this predicament in his 1941 book, Escape from Freedom. The gist of it is this: when people perceive an increase in disorder, they feel tremendous anxiety. Inevitably, this anxiety leads to a quest for security. To bring a sense of safety back into their lives, they latch on to authoritarianism and conformity. As Fromm noted, this often leads to “a readiness to accept any ideology and any leader if only he offers a political structure and symbols which allegedly give meaning and order to an individual’s life”. He had observed this in Germany, which he fled in 1933: “Modern man still is anxious and tempted to surrender his freedom to dictators of all kinds,” he wrote.

Fromm was speculating about this dynamic. But decades later, I and other psychologists have empirically shown how insecurity is linked to the rise of autocrats and the erosion of democracy. In a survey we conducted before the 2016 US presidential election, for example, we asked US residents questions about how fearful they were about various threats, such as illegal immigration, a lack of jobs, crime, terrorism, an attack from Iran, among others. They also responded to statements aimed at gauging their desire for stricter rules and their support for different political candidates, including Trump. We conducted the same survey in 2017 in France, measuring support for Marine Le Pen.

The results of both studies were telling: people who felt threatened wanted to tighten up – to have stricter rules – which predicted their support for Trump or Le Pen in the US and France, respectively. Other research confirms the same pattern. Economic threats and the growing gap between the rich and poor also create a sense of chaos and instability. This has led to increased support for strong leaders willing to challenge democratic values and practices.

It’s a simple principle, one that is causing democracies all around the world to unravel. When people experience threat – whether actual or imagined – they begin to “tighten”. In physical terms, they tense their muscles, ready to defend themselves. In political terms, they begin to crave security and order in a community that seems to be collapsing. Authoritarian leaders satiate this need by promising quick, simple solutions – and, above all, a return to the tighter social order of yesteryear.

Leaders are aware of this basic psychology and exaggerate threats to gain popularity. Trump did so masterfully: at campaign rallies throughout 2015 and 2016, he warned his ever-growing crowds that the US was a nation on the “brink of disaster”. He cited Mexicans supposedly bringing violence across the border, global trade agreements and immigrants taking away jobs, and radicalised Muslims plotting terror on American soil. Throughout his campaign, he sent the clear message that he was capable of restoring social order: “I alone can fix it.” Analysing campaign speeches, we found that Trump used far more threatening language than Hillary Clinton.

To strengthen democracy, we’re going to have to deal with this threat psychology. Some of the threats, such as the loss of well-paid, secure employment, are real. We need to empathise with those who are struggling – rather than dismissing their fears – and develop innovative solutions, particularly for those put out of work by the decline of manufacturing amid the AI revolution.

31465,50a921319048d0c33212faaee719791d,"The number of people being caught each year by police for distracted driving, primarily using their mobile phones, is decreasing, but police say there is still enough of it going on to endanger roads.

Under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, it's illegal to use an electronic device while operating a motor vehicle. If you are caught, the penalty is a $368 fine and four driver penalty points, which means higher fees to insure your vehicle.

Statistics from ICBC show that in 2017, 39,000 people received violation tickets for the use of an electronic device while driving —10,000 fewer than were ticketed in 2014.

The province says that research shows that it's dangerous to use an electronic device in a car because drivers are half as attentive while using one.

Staff Sgt. Dave Duncan with the Vancouver Police Department's traffic section says habits around using phones in cars are changing. He says police rarely stop people holding the phone up to their face while driving, or like a piece of pizza to talk into one on speaker.

Duncan says that people now find other less obvious ways to use their phones, such as putting it in a coffee cup or wedging it in their clothing. The biggest offence he and his officers see though, is phone use while stopped at traffic lights, which he says is still dangerous and illegal.

'Oh, I've been caught'

To enforce the rules, officers stand at intersections, wait for vehicles to stop at red lights and watch for a driver's head drop.

Duncan says he can observe the driver unaware on their device for up to 15 seconds before he taps on their window.

""Usually the expression ... is a look of guilt, a look of 'oh, I've been caught,'"" he said. ""And I actually don't have very many people argue with me because they know that I've been standing there for so long.""

Duncan says the excuses offered such as ""I was just plugging it in"" or, ""I was just checking what time it was"" or ""I got a message"" are weak because they all involve the illegal use of phone in a vehicle.

Recent decisions from B.C. courts about people challenging the tickets seem to support that it's a tough sell especially if officers like Duncan provide detailed descriptions of what they observe such as the type of phone, what app was open and what fingers were being used.

What's allowed?

Duncan says two recent decisions, one from 2017 and one from 2019 have helped to pinpoint what's allowed and what isn't.

In the 2017 case R. v. Jahani, the courts found that plugging in your phone to charge it while driving is a contravention. Plugging it in before you start driving is allowed.

In 2019, the case R. v. Partridge established that having the phone unsecured in your vehicle, like sitting on the seat next to you, wasn't an offence. Police had originally ticketed Philip Partridge because they believed he was looking at his phone.

Duncan says unrestricted Class 5 drivers may use their cell phone hands free as long as the device is securely mounted to the vehicle. They can use one touch to answer or end calls.

Drivers can follow GPS settings, but those have to be programmed into the phone before driving starts. Afterwards drivers are not allowed to hold the device, touch it or watch the screen for any other purpose.

New or learning drivers are not allowed to use electronic devices at all, not even hands free."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The US aviation regulator Federal Aviation Administration has issued an advisory to all air carriers and commercial operators against flying into or crossing the Pakistan airspace citing “extremist/militant activity”.

“There continues to be a risk to US civil aviation from attacks against airports and aircraft, particularly for aircraft on the ground and aircraft operating at low altitudes, including during the arrival and departure phases of the flight,” reads the advisory.

The US regulator said in its NOTAM that there continues to be a risk to US civil aviation sector from attacks against airports and aircraft in Pakistan, particularly for aircraft on the ground and aircraft operating at low altitudes, including during the arrival and departure phases of flights.

“The ongoing presence of extremist/militant elements operating in Pakistan poses a continued risk to US civil aviation from small-arms fire, complex attacks against airports, indirect weapons fire, and anti-aircraft fire, any of which could occur with little or no warning,” it said.

In justification to the advisory, the FAA also makes mention of the Balakot airstrike by the IAF and the subsequent capturing of Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman by Pakistan in February last year, besides escalating tensions between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue.

“India and Pakistan employ a variety of advanced air-to-air fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missile systems capable of targeting aircraft up to and beyond overflight altitudes typically used by civil aircraft.” The advisory, however, makes note that both India and Pakistan have “no intent to target civil aviation”, but warns that “if military operations were to resume, such operations could present an inadvertent risk to the US civil aviation.”

It has also cited the presence of extremist groups in Pakistan. “Between 2014 and 2019, extremist/militant groups operating in Pakistan have demonstrated their ongoing capability and intent to target civil aviation through multiple attacks on aviation infrastructure, including airports,” the advisory reads. The advisory, posted on December 30, 2019, will be reevaluated on January 1, 2021, the notice said.

The regulator added that pilots or airlines must report safety or security incidents – which may happen in Pakistan – to the FAA. Pakistan on July 16 last year opened its airspace for India after about five months of restrictions imposed in the wake of a standoff with New Delhi.

Following the Balakot airstrikes by the Indian Air Force, Pakistan had closed its airspace on February 26 last year. Pakistan in October last year had also denied India’s request to allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s VVIP flight to use its airspace for his visit to Saudi Arabia over the Kashmir issue.

One of the small birds' habitats is near Jervis Bay on the NSW south coast and the other is Mallacoota in Victoria's East Gippsland, where fires forced people onto the beach to escape flames.

""It is a bird with very limited flight capabilities so it's very difficult for it to get out of the way of fire,"" Prof York said.

The eastern bristlebird's other habitat on the Gold Coast has also faced struggles in recent times but is not currently under threat from fire.

Despite the scale of destruction caused by the fires, both Prof York and Dr Davidson were hopeful that animal populations can recover.

""People get worried that species will become extinct but it's more about population size and they will return,"" he said.

""It is sometimes surprising how quickly things will recover - as soon as conditions are good again they can very rapidly breed up.""

By Samuel Oyadongha – Yenagoa

The power outage in Bayelsa State occasioned by the lingering face-off between the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) and the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHEDC) has entered its 10th day.

The IYC had on December 23, besieged the offices of the PHEDC and forced the staff to ground operations, occupying the premises to protest perceived poor power supply to residents.

The development, which resulted in a total power outage in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa capital, and its environs has compelled residents to rely solely on generators with a resultant increase in petrol demand.

Filling stations in Yenagoa have been struggling to cope with a large number of residents who thronged the stations to buy fuel in jerry cans

It was learned that efforts and talks to resolve the logjam hit a brick wall as the power company claimed that it was grappling with a debt burden of N16.5 billion as of Nov 2019 which had hampered its operations as a commercial concern.

However, the IYC has challenged the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHEDC) to substantiate its claim that customers in Bayelsa owed N16.5 billion.

Chairman of the IYC central zone, Mr. Kennedy Olorogun, who spoke on the update of the dialogue convened by Bayelsa government to resolve the impasse said the debt claim was a ‘fairy tale’ to cover up incompetence.

According to him, “information from the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) showed that there was sufficient power at the substation at Gbarain, Yenagoa but the PHEDC was not taking the power to homes.

An investigation shows that TCN on August 20, 2019, announced the lifting of a Suspension Order from the electricity market is placed on the PHEDC on July 27, for breach of ‘Market Conditions/participation Agreement.

According to the TCN notice available on its portal, the lifting of the sanction was a regulatory measure to ensure that distribution companies evacuate available power.

TCN said lifting the sanctions followed PHEDC’s compliance and took effect on August 19, 2019.

The PHEDC and TCN had been shifting the blame on the poor power supply in Bayelsa, with TCN, saying that the PHEDC was unable to take up available power at its substation while the PHEDC allege that it was not getting enough power from the TCN’s grid.”

Olorogun said that the N16.5 bn debt had no bearing with the power supply to Bayelsa which was the basis of the protest adding that the claim was cheap blackmail.

“The leadership of IYC Central Zone is challenging the claim made by the PHEDC that Bayelsa people owe electricity Bill of Sixteen Billion, Five Hundred Thousand Naira (N16.5bn).

“The people of Bayelsa have not been enjoying uninterrupted power supply over the years, which is the reason we are protesting, how come such huge amount when we are saying that we do not see power.

“The claim is just blackmail, we are demanding for service for which we are ready to pay for we are saying that we can no longer pay for darkness and services not rendered, that is our position.

“We call on PHEDC to justify and produce a proof of their claim with all necessary documents within this period or be ready to face legal actions by Ijaw people for defamation of character caused by the allegation.

Mr. John Onyi, Manager, Corporate Communication, PHEDC had said that the development had taken a negative toll on the utility company causing untold hardship to numerous customers.

He regretted that the Ahoada community also shut down PHED office in the area leading to total blackout in the ancient town compelling its customers to have a ‘black Christmas’.

“Members of PHED staff are now living in palpable fear as their lives have been threatened by the IYC who warned them not to be spotted around the offices, claiming that it has taken over PHED offices in Yenagoa.

“In addition, the IYC threatened that any vehicle belonging to PHED spotted in the city would not only be seized and impounded but have the driver of such vehicle assaulted.

“The IYC according to its leadership is demanding for 24/7 power supply and removal of breakers to enable the residents of Yenagoa to have an uninterrupted power supply.

“At various meetings previously held with the IYC, PHED had made its position known that the installation of breakers was for administrative convenience of the company and also not to jeopardize the life span of the equipment.

“On 24/7 power supply, the IYC has repeatedly been told that the limitation from the national grid does not allow that for now and PHED gets its share based on what is generated.

“The responsibility of PHED for the umpteenth time is to distribute what it gets to its customers in Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, and Rivers state.

“Yenagoa is not marginalized in terms of power supply as alleged by the Ijaw Youth Council but it is common knowledge that every disco including PHED does systematic load shedding.

“However, the sustainability of not only PHED but the power sector depends on payment of electricity bill from the customers,” Onyi explained.

He lamented the high debt profile stifling the company says that as of November 30, 2019 customers in Bayelsa owed PHEDC about N16.5 billion, a development that hampers operations.

31707,bfb23c6d0deaf2fdc96ba4886903ad56,"Fox News reports that Wednesday afternoon the dozens of pro-Iran militiamen who surrounded the U-S embassy in Baghdad, along with sympathetic protesters, withdrew.

It appeared to be an orchestrated protest. As militiamen left the area, smoke could be seen from one part of the embassy compound where a fire had been lit on the roof.

The siege resulted in broken windows and graffiti on walls—general destruction in the area surrounding the embassy. The protests were said to be a response for U-S airstrikes that were targeted at the militia over the weekend, which killed 25. That strike had been initiated because of a rocket attack on an Iraqi Army base resulting in the death of an American contractor. Several American troops were also injured.

Late Tuesday, around 100 U-S Marines arrived at the embassy to aide in security. The president has said the situation there “will not be a Benghazi.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

HSBC is considering another round of deep job cuts that could result in as many as 10,000 more staff being made redundant across its global business with up to 1,000 UK staff under threat, i has learned.

Sources familiar with the proposals revealed that a second mass wave of redundancies are planned for the middle of this year.

The cuts will be on top of 10,000 worldwide redundancies announced last October, as well as the 4,700 cuts revealed last August.

Decision due at end of February

Further details of the cuts and retail banking plans for mainland Europe are expected to be confirmed when the bank will reveal its annual results and updates the markets on the progress of the strategic review at the end of February.

If given approval by the bank’s board, the latest job losses will mean HSBC would have cut its workforce by almost 25,000 to around 218,000 in less than a year as it continues a strategy of refocusing the business on the more profitable corporate banking sector and its Asian units.



Last October the bank appointed Lazard to offload its French retail banking unit for around €1bn (£850m). The bank is working with Lazard to prepare the sale of its 270 branches across the country. The auction for the business is expected to kick off later this month, with the banking arm of French mail operator La Poste understood to be one potential bidder.

While the UK will not be hit as hard as the rest of Europe, around 10 per cent of the cuts are being proposed in London and at HSBC’s retail banking head office in Birmingham.



One source said: “Another big wave of cuts is being lined up for this coming summer. The bank is increasing focused on more profitable operations and looks like the balance of power will be very much tilted towards corporate banking and the Asian markets.”

CHICAGO -- Two toddlers died early Thursday in Chicago after a woman believed to be their mother stabbed a 70-year-old man, left one of the children in a bathtub and threw the other child out an 11th-floor apartment before jumping herself, police said.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said investigators were trying to determine exactly what happened and confirm the relationships. He said the man who was found with severe stab wounds in the apartment on the city’s South Side was believed to be the woman’s grandfather.

Guglielmi said both adults were in critical condition, and the man was undergoing surgery.

Officers were dispatched to the scene shortly before 2 a.m. Thursday after someone called 911 to report seeing a severely injured person on the street.

Before he and the woman were rushed to the University of Chicago Medical Center, the man told officers that the woman had stabbed him before she threw one toddler out the window, Guglielmi said.

Guglielmi said that the positions of the body suggest that 1-year-old boy was thrown out of the window before the woman jumped herself. He said that it is unclear why she survived, saying that perhaps something broke her fall.

Officers rushed up to apartment after being directed there by building security and found the body of a 2-year-old boy in a bathtub. He said the boy had suffered severe lacerations and was had been badly burned by scalding water.

Both children were pronounced dead at Comer Children’s Hospital.

The 70-year-old man was found inside the apartment, bleeding profusely from cuts to his face and body. There were initial reports that the man was the father of the woman, who is believed to be in her 30s, but Guglielmi said Thursday morning that based on the ages of the two and what the man told police, investigators believe he is the woman’s grandfather. Guglielmi also said he did not know if a weapon had been recovered.

Guglielmi said that police have not determined a motive for what appears to be a murder-attempted suicide by the woman. He said there were no calls made to police about any disturbance at the apartment in the hours before the 911 call.

On Tuesday, French chef Marc Veyrat lost the lawsuit he filed against Michelin after the dining guide downgraded his restaurant La Maison des Bois from three to two stars, the New York Times reports.

In September, Veyrat sued Michelin for falsely claiming that his restaurant’s souffle contained cheddar cheese in its two-star entry in the Michelin guide to France. (The previous year, Veyrat’s restaurant earned the guide’s highest rating: three stars.) According to Veyrat, the error raised doubts about the competence of Michelin’s inspectors and questions around whether an inspector visited his restaurant at all. Michelin denied both the error and Veyrat’s accusations.

The primary goal of the lawsuit was to force Michelin to produce documents, like restaurant receipts and critic notes, to prove that an inspector had dined at La Maison des Bois and “to clarify the exact reasons” behind Michelin’s two-star rating, the Guardian reported. Veyrat was seeking just one euro in damages.

But in court on Tuesday, Veyrat was denied that victory after failing to prove that being demoted in the Michelin guide had any effect on his restaurant’s business. In fact, Veyrat told Agence-France Presse that La Maison des Bois had never been busier. Michelin, meanwhile, is demanding €30,000 (or around $34,000) in damages and compensation over the suit, according to CNN.

Veyrat may have been the first chef to sue Michelin over his rating, but he’s not the last. In November, South Korean chef Eo Yun-gwon sued Michelin over the “insult” of being included in the Michelin guide after asking to be left out (insult is a crime in South Korean law). Eo’s Ristorante Eo had been downgraded to the “Michelin Plate” section of the guide and like Veyrat, he believed the guidebook’s inspectors were ill-equipped to properly evaluate his restaurant.

For years now, chefs have publicly requested that Michelin take back stars awarded to their restaurants, and Michelin consistently refuses those requests. But Veyrat, despite losing his lawsuit, will continue to denounce the guides. “I don’t want to be part of the Michelin Guide anymore,” he said to the Times. “I don’t want to have to deal with these people. They are bad, bad, bad.”

The Pakistan government on Thursday filed a review petition against the Supreme Court’s decision about legislation on the extension of service of Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa.

A three-member apex court bench headed by then chief justice Asif Saeed Khosa on November 28 granted a six-month extension to Gen Bajwa after being assured by the government that Parliament will pass legislation on the extension/reappointment of an army chief within six months.

The ruling came in the nick of time as Gen Bajwa, 59, was set to retire at midnight on November 28.

In the review petition, the government has urged the apex court to form a larger bench to hear the case and set aside the earlier judgment, Geo News reported.

The government also requested the court to keep the proceedings in-camera.

The petition argues that the apex court’s verdict did not take into account “important constitutional and legal” points. It says the court has itself “been giving extensions to additional and ad-hoc judges”, making a case for the government to exercise this discretion as well, the channel reported.

Furthermore, the petition argues that the court did not base its decision on the judgement in the judges extension case.

In its detailed judgement on December 16, the chief justice cautioned the government that “unbridled power or position, like unstructured discretion, is dangerous”.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had extended Gen Bajwa’s tenure through a notification in August, but the Supreme Court suspended it on November 26 due to irregularities in the manner of extension.

After three days of heightened uncertainty, Chief Justice Khosa announced that Bajwa would remain the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) for another six months during which the country’s Parliament would legislate on the Pakistan Army chief’s extension/reappointment.

Justice Khosa in his judgement note said “it has been a shocking revelation to us that the terms and conditions of service of the COAS, the tenure of his office, extension in the tenure of his office or his reappointment have remained unregulated by any law so far.”

The court observed that no law was present in the country to regulate the appointment, reappointment, extension and tenure of a four star general who is also the army chief.

The verdict also said that there was “legal vacuum” and it could only be bridged by an Act of the Parliament which should be done within six months.

However, the court warned that in the absence of legislation on the matter within six months, the institutional practice of retirement of a General on completion of the tenure of three years “shall stand enforced”.

Exercising judicial restraint, the court said it was giving an opportunity to the federal government to carry out appropriate legislation through an Act of Parliament within a period of six months on the COAS.

The unprecedented action by the apex court shook the high echelons of power.

The powerful military, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has wielded considerable power in deciding matters concerning security and foreign policies."," Threaten, not specified below",3

""He was in a lot of pain and was so upset.""

Because of his conditions, Stephen doesn't usually leave the house.

Frances added: ""I've not been feeling very well and we needed fresh bread so Stephen went to get it.

""He was only out for a short while before it happened. He never usually leaves the house.

(Image: Frances Smith)

""It's disgusting. He's my son and nobody should hurt him like that.

""Thankfully he's okay now as it could have been a lot worse.""

Frances is desperately trying to find those responsible for the vicious attack.

One of the men is described as black, 6ft, wearing a grey hoodie and the other attackers are described as white, also around 6ft, with one wearing a red top under a dark jacket.

Frances added: ""If anyone knows who these men are please let me know. They need to be held accountable for what they've done.""

32107,df1b94b1870709d33015ab6951e6f235,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) — Sometimes even the pope has to apologize for being grumpy.

On Wednesday (Jan. 1), Pope Francis kick-started the new year with an apology for slapping the hand of a woman who grabbed his arm in St. Peter’s Square the night before.

“Love makes us patient,” Pope Francis told faithful gathered to celebrate the feast of the Solemnity of Mary and the 53rd World Day of Peace.

“We often lose our patience. Me too, and I apologize for the bad example I set yesterday,” he added.

While walking amid the crowds near the Nativity scene in St. Peter’s Square on Tuesday night, Francis reached his hands to greet faithful and children. One woman grabbed his hand, causing him to lose his balance. Visibly irritated, the pope slapped the hand of the woman twice with his left hand before walking away.

The images of the papal slap made the rounds on the internet and especially social media. Where one stands regarding Pope Francis plays no small part in whether his act is interpreted as “angry” or “righteous.”

And he's not the first pope to take part in a controversial slap.

In September 1303, Pope Boniface VIII was slapped by an envoy from Prince Philip of France in the small town of Anagni, just outside of Rome. (There's some question over whether the envoy actually slapped the pope in the face or not.)

Boniface had been working to reduce the influence that Philip had on the Catholic Church. So Boniface issued a papal document, claiming that the pontiff had absolute power and supremacy over kings of earthly realms.

For the pope’s admirers and courtesans, who included the famed painter Giotto, this was a sound and essential move. But for his foes, who included the poet Dante Alighieri, such an offense merited a very specific place in hell – the eighth circle, to be exact.

Philip was not thrilled by the papal document. In a move known as the Slap of Anagni, or the Outrage of Anagni, Philip's envoy took Boniface prisoner, then had him tortured and beaten for a few days. He was released after the local populace objected and he died only a month later, paving the way for the French dominion over the papacy.

In the past, slaps were part of Catholic rituals.

Young men becoming priests were lightly slapped by their bishop as were young people who were being confirmed. The practice has been largely abandoned, for the most part because it was misunderstood.

Thanks to video and social media, there is no doubt concerning the details of Pope Francis’ New Year's slap, which was captured on video. The response was mixed.

For Italian right-wing populist Matteo Salvini, the event offered a special opportunity to target and make fun of the pontiff, who has been an opposition force for Salvini's anti-migration policies.

For many women, Francis’ slap took on another dimension.

Francis has condemned violence against women and in a speech on Tuesday spoke of victims of abuse who are “continually offended, beaten, raped, forced into prostitution.” He also spoke in support of giving women more leadership and influence. These words strongly clashed with the widely distributed images showing Francis slapping a woman, twice.

Wednesday was also not the first time a pope apologized publicly for something. Throughout his pontificate, St. John Paul II apologized for the Catholic Church’s role in the African slave trade, the deaths of Muslims during the Crusades, the Holocaust and the Inquisition.

A FOUR-month pregnant married woman drank poison and her stomach exploded leading to her death, after she was caught having sex with another man from her village.The incident happened last week on Monday at Mairosi Village, Chisina 3, Ward 25 in Gokwe South.A family source who requested anonymity said: ""Reuben Mutemarinda (42) came home from a beer binge and found his wife Ruth Kaurosi (34) having sex with Everisto Dzivarepasi. He tried to grab him, but he fled in boxer shorts and left his trousers and a shirt.""A villager, Trynos Mataruka, said the deceased apologised before she killed herself.""She apologised to her husband. But later on, she went to a nearby bush where she drank a cotton pesticide. She vomited and her stomach started to bulge. It burst while she was being ferried to Gokwe District Hospital where she died,"" said Mataruka.Mataruka added: ""Initially her husband refused to collect the corpse, saying Ruth must be buried at Dzivarepasi's place. Some family elders tried to reason with him, but he stood his ground. They had to report the matter to Chief Chisina who intervened by ordering Mutemarinda to collect the corpse and bury it. The burial was done last week on Thursday at Mairosi Village after the body had spent four days at the mortuary.""Contacted for a comment Chief Chisina confirmed the incident.""I can confirm that a woman Ruth Kaurosi (34) from Mairosi Village drank poison and later died at a hospital.

32263,8c6b0bbf2a6f006957f97378325504f1,"“Progressive” prosecutors, bail reforms, and increased calls for accountability will all likely be in the news next year.

At the state level, 2019 was largely a year of missed opportunities for reforming the criminal legal system in Texas. Despite a reputation for leading on criminal justice reform, Texas lawmakers accomplished very little in this year’s legislative session. Yes, they mandated some baseline protections for women behind bars. And they killed the Driver Responsibility Program, a much-maligned surcharge system that prevented more than 1 million Texas drivers from keeping or renewing their licenses, which some lawmakers had wanted to eliminate for years. But beyond that, as Scott Henson—a widely recognized criminal justice researcher who writes the must-read blog Grits for Breakfast—put it, the 86th session was a “killing field” for criminal justice reforms.

While the Legislature won’t meet again until January 2021, there are still developments at the local level that could lead to significant changes in the coming year. Here are a few I’m watching:

What’s a “Progressive Prosecutor”?

Houston-area progressives supported Kim Ogg when she first ran for Harris County district attorney in 2014. At the time, she signaled a departure from the tough-on-crime, lock ‘em up-mentality that once reigned in Texas’ largest city, instead vowing to reform how prosecutors handle petty pot cases. She lost that election, but succeeded in 2016 after running on a similar, reform-minded platform. After her election, she implemented diversion programs for misdemeanor marijuana possession and other low-level offenses, and declared herself “part of the national reform movement,” which in recent years has started to focus on electing progressive prosecutors committed to dismantling mass incarceration.

That movement has grown beyond Ogg and the low-hanging fruit improvements that defined her first two campaigns. In the years since, it has favored DAs who have promised to make more fundamental changes, like refusing to prosecute certain drug cases, reforming probation, and changing how crimes related to poverty and homelessness are handled. In the meantime, Ogg has back-tracked on issues she once vocally supported, like bail reform, and has repeatedly tried to expand the DA’s office, further souring her reputation among reformers.

Ogg now faces multiple challengers from the left in the March 2020 Democratic primary, as do misdemeanor and felony prosecutors in two other must-watch primaries in Travis County. How these races shake out, and what policies the victors ultimately push, could redefine what it means to be a progressive prosecutor in Texas.

Help Not Handcuffs

Last year, the Dallas Police Department created a special team comprised of an officer, paramedic, and social worker to patrol South Central Dallas, an area with a high concentration of mental health-related police calls. That pilot program, aimed at putting people in treatment rather than jail, appears to be working enough for Dallas to try expanding the program citywide.

More Texas cities seem to be embracing the approach. Earlier this year, the Austin City Council approved an additional $1.7 million in funding for paramedics and clinicians to help field 911 calls and divert mental health crises to caseworkers and EMS rather than police.

Bail Reform, Redux

In more Harris County news, this year officials settled a landmark lawsuit over bail policies that keep low-level defendants in jail because they’re poor, ushering in reforms that were largely made possible thanks to a Democratic sweep in the 2018 midterms.

Although that settlement established sweeping new protections, reformers see their victory in Harris County as just the first step. The same legal team that successfully reformed the county’s misdemeanor bail policies filed a second lawsuit challenging how judges decide bail at the felony level. Similar lawsuits have been filed in Dallas and Galveston counties too.

If we’ve learned anything, next year should provide even more examples of the need for oversight of TDCJ before state lawmakers reconvene in 2021.

Policing the Police

The Black Lives Matter movement and the renewed focus on police violence has put a spotlight on the way police departments investigate themselves. Tragedy can jumpstart the discussion, as we saw this year with the case of Botham Jean, an unarmed black man shot to death inside his own apartment by a white Dallas police officer. This year, the fallout from Jean’s death led to new calls for police accountability and expanded community oversight for the Dallas Police Department. Officials in neighboring Fort Worth are also pursuing a plan for civilian police oversight. The impetus: the death of Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman shot to death by a white officer dispatched to her home for a routine welfare check in October.

Crisis of Confidence at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice

There have been at least 24 heat-related deaths inside Texas’ uncooled prisons over the past two decades. After fighting a lawsuit over the issue for four years, the Texas prison system was finally forced into a settlement last year that mandated air conditioning for medically vulnerable inmates—an agreement prison officials kept getting dragged back into court for breaking this year. As 2019 ends, Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) officials stand accused of lying to cover up prison temperatures and face threats of jail time from the very frustrated federal judge on the case.

Advocates for prison reform have asked lawmakers to create an independent body to monitor TDCJ thanks to the steady drumbeat of scandals at the agency—from heat deaths to guards planting contraband on prisoners to rising reports of suicide and use of force behind bars. This year advocates renewed their push to create a watchdog office that would inspect and report on problems inside the state’s adult lockups (which is what lawmakers created for Texas’ scandal-plagued juvenile prisons more than a decade ago). The bill stalled, but if we’ve learned anything from this year, the next one should provide even more examples of the need for oversight before state lawmakers reconvene in 2021.

After Amazon employees publicly pressured their employer to take aggressive action on climate change, the company has warned two workers that they could be fired if they continue to violate Amazon’s “external communications policy.”

Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, an organization leading worker action on climate change, is pushing back, alleging that the company is trying to silence workers and vowing to continue calling for stronger leadership in reducing climate damage.

This is not the time to shoot the messengers. This is not the time to silence those who are speaking out.

“Now is a time when we need to have communications policies that let us speak honestly about our company’s role in the climate crisis,” said Maren Costa, a user experience principal designer at Amazon, and one of those threatened with termination, in a prepared statement.

“This is not the time to shoot the messengers,” she said. “This is not the time to silence those who are speaking out.”

In a news release issued today, a half-dozen employees went on record to share their concerns about the rules, and long-time environmental activist Bill McKibben tweeted in response: “the world is on fire. Climate leaders don’t silence employees who are sounding the alarm. This is sick behavior…”

Tell @Amazon and @JeffBezos: the world is on fire. Climate leaders don't silence employees who are sounding the alarm. This is sick behavior–please RT this at Amazon. https://t.co/wvAaY505db — Bill McKibben (@billmckibben) January 2, 2020

Amazon in September updated its communications policy and notified employees in a message that states: “As a general rule, external communication by employees about Amazon’s business, products, services, technology, or customers must be approved in advance by public relations.”

The company said this is a standard approach to regulating company-related speech.

“Our policy regarding external communications is not new and we believe is similar to other large companies. We recently updated the policy and related approval process to make it easier for employees to participate in external activities such as speeches, media interviews, and use of the company’s logo,” said Amazon spokesperson Jaci Anderson by email.

Anderson added that the company is working to make it easier for employees and “approvers” to navigate the pre-approval process, including building an intranet page for approvals to streamline the process and reduce the number and seniority of managers required to green-light communication.

University of Washington political science professor Aseem Prakash was surprised and disappointed by the news. In raising concerns about Amazon’s efforts to address climate change, workers “are not disclosing any confidential information,” he said. “There is no breach.”

Prakash, who is the founding director of the UW Center for Environmental Politics, noted that the employees Amazon wants to recruit and retain “are quite concerned about climate change.”

Over the course of more than a year, Amazon employees have been taking steps to pressure the cloud computing and retail juggernaut to improve its transparency regarding its climate impacts and to promise to reduce its carbon footprint. Those steps include:

The co-filing of a shareholder resolution at the end of 2018 calling on Amazon to create a climate plan.

Posting an open letter in April 2019 addressed to Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos and his board of directors. The missive has been signed by 8,700 employees and calls out the shortcomings of the company’s climate-related measures, asking for specific steps to reduce emissions.

Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, who were part of the shareholder resolution, protested outside Amazon’s annual meeting in May. During the meeting’s Q&A portion, one of the employees asked Bezos if he would support initiatives to address climate change.

In September, Amazon workers, as well as employees at other tech companies, joined the youth-led Global Climate Strike and walked out of work.

And Amazon, one the the most valuable companies in the world, has in recent months taken steps to respond to what many call a climate crisis.

With great fanfare, Bezos in September — one day before the planned walk out — announced new climate actions, including the creation of a Climate Pledge that sets ambitious greenhouse gas emission goals for the tech giant and urges other companies to do the same.

“We’re done being in the middle of the herd on this issue — we’ve decided to use our size and scale to make a difference,” said Bezos in a prepared statement shared for the announcement.

The initiative included launching a sustainability website to bring previously lacking transparency to Amazon’s actions. The company disclosed details of its carbon footprint: 44.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent released in 2018. (The U.S. emitted roughly 5,000 million metric tons of CO2e in 2015 while the UK, for example, emitted 389 million metric tons of CO2e.) The company also pledged to reach 80% renewable energy for its global infrastructure within five years, and use entirely renewable power by 2030.

But while Bezos is expressing enthusiasm for these environmental efforts, the squeaky-wheel tactics of employees is clearly still rankling leadership.

The Amazon employee group shared a statement critical of the company’s partnership with fossil fuel companies for a Washington Post article published in October. The statement was attributed to Costa and Jamie Kowalski, an Amazon software development engineer (Bezos coincidentally owns the Washington Post).

After Amazon officials investigated the matter, the employees were given an email warning in November sent from a principal of employee relations. Costa was cautioned to abide by company policy requiring that she get pre-approval from the company before speaking out, or face “formal corrective action.”

Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer for Amazon, has been an active employee leader on climate issues. She noted that the communications policy was updated one day after Amazon Employees for Climate Justice announced that it would participate in the September climate strike. Anderson, the company spokesperson, said the process to update the policy began in the spring.

“It’s no surprise that Amazon rolled out this change to the communication policy the day after we announced the walkout,” Cunningham said today by email. “We know that the change in the policy was a result of how successful we have been by publicly speaking out about the climate crisis.”

Even if they silence the employees, the problem will not go away.

Amazon isn’t alone in clamping down on employee speech. Google recently fired workers for alleged violations of its data security policies and code of conduct, though employees claim the real cause was their decision speak out against Google on issues including pay disparity and government contracts with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and others.

Workers have two options if they don’t like their employer’s actions: quit or exercise their voices and fight the system from within, Prakash said.

“I hope some senior managers who have more clout will say that this is wrong,” Prakash said of the Amazon stance.

“Even if they silence the employees,” he said. When it comes to climate change, “the problem will not go away.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3
32292,b7e9d1e51ae5178d19f7928f85575c79,"American polling firm Gallup has found that Afghans are the saddest people on earth, finding that nearly nine in ten respondents are “suffering,” in their own words, with zero percent claiming that they are currently “thriving.” When asked to rate their life out of a score of ten, Afghans gave an average answer of 2.7, a record low for any country studied. Worse still, when asked to predict the quality of their life in five years, the average answer was even lower: 2.3.

As the study mentioned, “the unprecedented finding highlights Afghans’ near-universal lack of optimism.” In more than a decade of data collection around the world on the topic, this is the first time that any population predicted that their future lives would be worse than their current ones. This, to Gallup, was “all the more notable” due to Afghanistan’s very young population; two-thirds of those interviewed were aged 35 or under. Less than half of the country said they experienced enjoyment or were treated with respect in the previous day, while 52 percent admitted to worrying for much of the day, up 10 percentage points from 2016.

Remarkably, the study does not mention the 18-year U.S.-led invasion and occupation of the country as a potential explanatory factor for their suffering. In fact, it explicitly warns against an American withdrawal, arguing that it would “strengthen the Taliban’s grip” over the country, thus, tacitly endorsing the U.S. government and presenting the military as a force for good in the region.











The United States attacked Afghanistan in October 2001, invading just weeks after the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. It justified the decision on the inaccurate claim that the Taliban were not willing to negotiate handing over top suspect Osama Bin Laden. Since 2001, the occupation and fighting have not stopped, destroying the country in the process and leading to the U.S. spending an estimated $2 trillion on the war. The U.S. military and its allies are the number one killers in the country. Despite this, the Taliban is now in a stronger position than at any time in the last two decades, controlling more territory than it did in 2001.

The human cost of the conflict is clear but quantifiable statistics are sparse. The World Bank estimates that the number of Afghans living in poverty rose from 9.1 million in 2007 to 19.3 million in 2016. The average income is less than 2,000 U.S. Dollars per year, one of the lowest of any country in the world.

This is not the first time that Gallup has downplayed its explosive findings that imply a strongly anti-imperialist message. In 2014, it surveyed world public opinion on which country they believed was the greatest threat to world peace. The overwhelming number one choice was the United States, with a quarter of those polled selecting the U.S. out of nearly 200 countries. Even in closely allied states like Germany, fear of America was highest. Pakistan was a distant second, buoyed by a large Indian vote in the survey. Gallup decided not to ask the question again. A December poll from the Pew Research Center also showed a majority of Mexicans consider the U.S. the greatest threat to their country.

In December, the Afghanistan Papers were leaked to the Washington Post. In what political commentator Kyle Kulinski described as the worst media failure of 2019, the documents revealed that high-level military officers believed that the war was unwinnable, but that knowledge was kept from the public by the government who deliberately misled the public since the invasion. Kulinski decried the near “total lack of coverage” of the news. “We were lied to all throughout the war, every step of the way” he said; “18 years we’ve been at war…no good has come from it.”

On the Afghanistan Papers, MintPress News contributor Medea Benjamin said:

The debacle in Afghanistan is only one case in a fundamentally flawed U.S. policy with worldwide consequences. New quasi-governments installed by U.S. “regime change” in country after country have proven more corrupt, less legitimate and less able to control their nation’s territory than the ones the U.S. has destroyed.

She argued that there is a single premise that Washington “refuses to learn”: that the underlying fault is not in how the U.S. tries to change societies through regime change, but in the “fundamental illegitimacy of regime change itself.” While the Trump administration has made a few noises about a withdrawal from Afghanistan, successive regimes before it have made similar proclamations. And with the recent deployment of 4,000 extra troops to Iraq, it doesn’t appear that the Middle East will have anything to smile about any time soon.

NEW BRUNSWICK - A Paterson woman has pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide and driving while intoxicated in connection with a Route 1 North Brunswick crash in which an 80-year-old man was killed and another person was injured.

Elizabeth Gomez, 43, pleaded guilty Dec. 23 to the second degree charges, acting Middlesex County Prosecutor Christopher L.C. Kuberiet said in a release.

As part of the plea agreement reached with Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor Keith Abrams, Gomez faces up to 10 year year in state prison for causing a crash that killed Wen-Fu Li, 80, of East Brunswick and injured a 47-year-old man who was a passenger in Li's vehicle, the release states.

As part of the No Early Release Act, Gomez will have to serve 85 percent of her prison term before becoming eligible for parole. She also will be subject to the loss of her driver's license for five years to life upon her release from prison. The term for how long she will lose her driving privileges will be determined at sentencing, which is scheduled for March 4 before Superior Court Judge Colleen M. Flynn.

An investigation determined Gomez was intoxicated in the early morning hours of Sept. 22, 2018, when she was driving a 2007 BMW X3 on Route 1 near Fashion Plaza Drive and she ran a red light and crashed into a 2016 Chevrolet Malibu, causing the death of the driver Li and injuring his passenger.

32358,54ae33cbbcdfcfc941cee461aafc94c8,"While Philadelphia's public school students returned to classes on Thursday after winter break, two city elementary schools remained closed after the Philadelphia School District continues the work to remove the asbestos found in the buildings in December.

Alexander McClure Elementary School in Hunting Park and Laura H. Carnell Elementary School in Oxford Circle will be closed on Thursday and Friday out of an “abundance of caution,” the school district announced.

The schools closed last month to remediate the asbestos after exposed insulation was found on pipes in both buildings. The plan had been for McClure and Carnell to reopen on Thursday.

The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers called for the closure of Carnell and relocation for students after the district’s environmental team and PFT found the damaged and exposed asbestos insulation on a pipe insulation inside a staff bathroom. Crushed asbestos tiles also were found in a maintenance closet. Teachers reported concerns in eight different classroom, as well.

Carnell students and staff were relocated to Little School House on 1722 S. Fourth St., while McClure students and staff were moved to Roberto Clemente Middle School on 122 W. Erie Ave.

Asbestos has been a issue for the school district this school year. In September, the renovated building that was supposed to be the new combined home for Benjamin Franklin High School and Science Leadership Academy on North Broad Street closed when school officials found airborne asbestos inside areas were ductwork insulation had been damaged.

Two others schools closed for remediation this year, including Franklin Learning Center on 606 N. 15th St. and Pratt Head Start on 2200 N. 22nd St.

A source told the Daily Mail: “There was a pattern through the campaign of unhelpful documents being released. The intention was to embarrass the Government.” The source added: “It does suggest we have a Labour mole and we are going to root them out.”

It comes as Mr Corbyn got his hands on at least two sets of documents that challenged the Prime Minister’s claims about Brexit and the NHS. The documents were brandished by Mr Corbyn at two Labour events. The first was a paper that claimed the Tories were in talks about selling off the NHS to US President Donald Trump in a post-Brexit trade deal. This was branded fake by the Government and mocked during TV debates among party leaders.

The second was titled ‘NI Protocol’ and was linked to trade routes involving Northern Ireland after Brexit. A senior Government source said it was an “initial” assessment. The source added the document had not even been signed off. Mr Johnson has ordered two separate inquiries - one for each document.

The NHS papers first appeared in a post on Reddit in October and the site has now said it believes it is “part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia”. Reddit said it believed the documents were leaked as “part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia”. Following a disastrous election result that saw Labour squeezed down to a majority of 203 - the worst Labour election result since before the start of the Second World War - Mr Corbyn said he would stand down in March, triggering a leadership bid. One of the favourites for his role is Sir Keir Starmer who was today warned the party faces another election wipeout should he win the leadership bid and keep Mr Corbyn on as an aide.

Professor Tony Travers, director of LSE London, said Mr Starmer should cut all ties with Mr Corbyn if Labour stood any chance of a victory in the next five years. Bookmaker Ladbrokes currently have him odds-on at 8/13, with Rebecca Long-Bailey on 4-1. Prof Travers told Express.co.uk even if he does emerge triumphantly, it could all be in vain unless Mr Starmer manages to lead Labour back to the centre ground of British politics. He explained: “Given that the membership that will vote on this still contains substantial numbers of Momentum-backers in its ranks, any successful candidate is going to have to keep them onside.

32381,fc65456acf3af9a3c91aebb8f886b346,"Here’s a message to Democrats and all patriots: Don’t give up when the Senate acquits Donald Trump.

File suit right away to prevent him from going to any foreign government to fix the election.

The House bill of impeachment makes clear that Trump used the power of his office — indeed, compromised his obligation to defend the country — when he held up aid to Ukraine to extract a partisan advantage in 2020. As federal citizens, we have a right under the First Amendment to a free and fair election, without the highest government officer of the land using corrupt means to help his re-election.

The lawsuit to stop Trump from continuing this course of action would not seek retroactive relief. This would not be a damages claim, but an order to stop him in the future.

A plaintiff in a lawsuit has a right to seek prospective injunctive relief to stop a pattern of corrupt activity from continuing. Any threat to interfere with rights under the First Amendment is usually “irreparable injury,” which justifies issuing an injunction.

To say the least, there is a pattern of conduct by Trump to justify such action.

Ever since the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison, the federal courts have claimed an inherent equitable power to restrain violations of the Constitution. There is a controversy over whether the courts have the inherent power to award damages as well, but that would not be relevant in a suit to stop Trump from continuing the acts that led to his impeachment.

Nor does the case seek to enforce 52 U.S. Code 30121, which prohibits foreign governments from making contributions. It is arguably not the right of citizens to enforce that spending restriction.

But the quid pro quo the president sought from Ukraine was not about money; it was for a much darker and more sinister way of assisting him in return for the release of U.S. military assistance, which had been allocated to help the country defend itself from Russia.

Trump is likely to try some such tactics again. In 2016 he said he would not accept the outcome of any election he did not win. He made an unprecedented and frivolous threat to imprison his rival if he won – something that even Vladimir Putin is too discreet to say. He also invited the Russians to hack the emails of his opponents. He can and should be imputed with knowledge — at least for civil purposes, unlike the criminal standard used by special counsel Robert Mueller — to show that he sought or would have accepted the assistance of the Russians in 2016. So the case for an injunction — based on civil, not criminal law standards — is strong, even overwhelming. Apart from a pattern showing he is more than ready to act outside the law, there is Trump’s brazen defense of his shakedown of Ukraine – saying he’s not asking for a quid pro quo when it’s right there in black and white in the White House’s own doctored transcript.

The objections to a claim for injunctive relief are feeble. It matters less, for example, that the impairment of the First Amendment right is small, when there is no legitimacy to the governmental act being challenged.

Let the president deny there was a quid pro quo? Fine, because this opens him up to discovery and a deposition. Let the president claim executive privilege? Also fine, because there is no executive privilege to engage in a criminal act.

Nor would the “political question” doctrine bar relief, because of improper second-guessing of U.S. foreign policy. It’s not “foreign policy” if the president is shaking down a foreign leader to kick in to his re-election. Likewise, it is not a matter of “zoning policy” when a Chicago alderman wants a bribe to make a change.

The “political question” doctrine is a bar only if the Constitution were to commit the right to extortion and bribery to the exclusive discretion of the president. Well, it doesn’t.

In 1952, the Supreme Court enjoined President Harry Truman from seizing a steel mill despite a serious claim that it was a matter of national security. Trump’s squalid quid pro quo is a much easier case by comparison.

Impossible to supervise? No, the order would also bind those around Trump: If they looked the other way, they would be in contempt, too. This is a White House where we can count on leaks aplenty.

Nor do we have to look far for a plaintiff: All readers who are U.S. citizens entitled to vote have standing to bring an action protecting their right to participate in free and fair elections, without interference by foreign powers. It’s a representational injury — a right not to be a victim of election-type racketeering.

The attorneys general of the various states — California, New York and others — would have standing to protect the voting rights of their citizens. Indeed, they have a good record in suing Trump. The Democratic National Committee has associational standing to protect the party’s candidates running in the presidential primaries who may be affected, or the party’s eventual nominee.

As Chief Justice John Marshall might have told us, the federal courts have inherent equity power to stop a president from committing high crimes and misdemeanors that also violate our constitutional rights — even though Congress alone can remove him from office. The misconduct to be enjoined here is of a different kind from what Richard Nixon committed during Watergate. By the time of the Nixon impeachment hearing, he had already been re-elected. There was no danger posed from another Watergate break-in, or even another cover-up.

But the 2020 election is still to come, and when the Senate acquits him, Trump is free to commit yet another enormity like the shakedown of Ukraine. The impeachable offense could happen again and again.

A patient is recovering at home following Alberta’s first confirmed case of a severe vaping-related illness.

Alberta’s chief medical officer of health confirmed the province’s first case of severe vaping-associated lung illness on Thursday.

Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the case was confirmed a few days ago, but would not say where in Alberta it was reported.

Hinshaw said the patient was admitted to hospital for treatment, but would not release any further information about the patient for confidentiality reasons, apart from saying they are now recovering at home.

“We’re not releasing that information because it is a rare event,” Hinshaw said. “In this particular case, the symptoms really were about the lungs.”

The Alberta case is the 15th vaping-associated illness reported in Canada, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

Of the 14 other cases, three occurred in British Columbia, two were in New Brunswick, four were reported in Ontario and five happened in Quebec. Of those 14 cases, 11 people required admission to hospital.

“We are actively monitoring the situation in Alberta and working with health officials across Canada to share information and better understand this illness,” Hinshaw said.

“I want to remind all Albertans that vaping has health risks, and the only way to completely avoid these risks is by not vaping.” Tweet This

Since September, Alberta physicians have been required to report potential vaping-related illnesses to public health officials, as per a condition under the Public Health Act.

Since then, Hinshaw said they’ve received 12 notifications.

“The other 11 that have been looked into have not met probable or confirmed case definition. So this is the first that has met that case definition.” Tweet This

The federal government is currently investigating the emergence of vaping-associated lung illness, also known as severe pulmonary illness associated with vaping.

“Vaping products may contain dozens of chemicals,” according to the government of Canada.

“Most vaping substances available for sale are flavoured and contain nicotine. Canadians should not use vaping products obtained illegally, including any vaping products that contain cannabis.”

Alberta is currently the only province in Canada without vaping legislation.

Last fall, the Alberta government launched a review of Alberta’s Tobacco and Smoking Reduction Act, which will also address vaping.

The health minister is expected to receive the final report “in the coming weeks,” the province said Thursday. Any amendments are expected to be in place by this spring.

The shocking assault is said to have occurred on New Years Eve after the three victims met the men at a pub in Murcia.

Two of the women told police they were raped while the third said she fought off her attacker as he tried to force himself on her, although she is reported to have been attacked in the process.

Murcia police have confirmed they are investigating.

A spokesman for Policia Nacional told the Mail Online: “I can confirm a formal complaint has been made by three women and we are investigating.

“We cannot say any more because the investigation is ongoing.”

According to local sources, the women are sisters from the US and are aged 23, 20 and 18.

La Opinion de Murcia reported that the two sisters were visiting a third, who is studying in the city and was soon to return home.

According to an evening news release from the EIB, a 40-year-old man suffered serious injuries during a police intervention in the late afternoon on Jan. 1.

According to the version of the facts provided by the SPVM, an emergency services call was received around 3:15 p.m. for ""a man in crisis, armed with knives, who was on a balcony.""

The intervention took place on Saint-Michel Blvd., near the intersection of Laurier Ave., in the Rosemont - La Petite-Patrie borough.

Police allegedly erected a security perimeter at the scene and communicated with the individual in crisis.

At the request of the police, the man allegedly agreed to put down his knives, but around 5:30 p.m. he picked up one of the sharp objects to injure his neck.

The paramedics quickly transported the injured man to the hospital and he is in critical condition.

The BEI's mandate is to investigate all police interventions in which a person dies or suffers serious injuries. A team of eight investigators has been dispatched to the scene of the intervention and will have to check whether the version reported by the SPVM is faithful to the events.

32738,b1ef33d0bdeb79afb1226d1a47cfb7c5,"Early Tuesday, pro-Iranian Iraqi militia members and demonstrators stormed the US Embassy compound in Baghdad after the Trump administration's airstrikes on a Iranian-backed militia on Sunday. The embassy attack, perhaps the worst crisis between Iraq and the US since 2003, reveals the inconsistency and vulnerability of the Trump administration's policies toward both Iran and Iraq.

Like a modern-day Gulliver, President Trump is metaphorically wandering around a Middle East where he'd rather not be, tied up both by smaller powers whose interests are not his own -- and by America's illusions about the region, perpetuated by Trump who somehow believes he can force Iran to bend to his will. The odds are that the situation for the US in Iraq and Iran is likely to get worse before it gets still worse.

US in a bind

The US had little choice but to respond on Sunday to recent pro-Iranian Iraqi militia attacks against US forces in Kirkuk, which claimed the life of an American contractor and wounded US forces. The Trump administration needed both to deter and signal to Tehran that such attacks were unacceptable. Failure to do so would have left the administration in violation of one of its own red lines -- that the US would not tolerate attacks against Americans.

Aaron David Miller Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, focusing on U.S. foreign policy. More >

But the US attacks in response seemed intentionally disproportionate, killing at least 25 militia and injuring scores of others . And it seems the US did not take into consideration that the airstrikes would seriously embarrass the government of Iraq or could lead to reactions like a storming of the American Embassy.

The storming of the embassy raises questions as to why the administration didn't think through how Tehran might respond to Sunday's airstrikes on five pro-Iranian militia bases in Iraq and Syria, and why security at the embassy wasn't beefed up in advance.

The US doesn't have home court advantage

Iran has effectively coordinated attacks against US forces before, especially during the early phases of the Iraq war. But following this most recent attack, it should be clear that Washington isn't on a level playing field in Iraq and that Iran enjoys a tremendous advantage, for a number of reasons.

First, the Iraqi government is much more financially and economically dependent on its Iranian neighbor than it is obligated to the US. Iraq is the second-largest importer of Iranian non-oil commodities, and Iran is a key supplier of electricity to the country's southern region.

Second, while we have spent billions in training, equipping and assisting Iraqi security forces with arguably a fair amount of success, the integration of several of the most pro-Iranian militias into those security forces is increasingly problematic. These forces have played a role in brutally helping the Iraqi government repress recent Shia demonstrators, and the initial storming of the embassy compound could not have been accomplished without government security forces' acquiescence to the militias.

Third, the US handed Iran a tremendous propaganda advantage. It has turned anti-Iranian sentiment among Iraqis against the US and sparked protesters at the US Embassy to throw rocks and chant ""Death to America.""

What's Trump's end game with Iran?

Things appear calmer around the embassy Wednesday morning. But it's too early to determine whether recent events will lead to a broader US confrontation with Iranian proxies or Iran itself. One thing is clear: President Trump's approach to Iran is muddled by a number of cross-cutting factors which make any policy move on Iran unpredictable.

On one hand, in the wake of his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord, Trump launched a tough-minded campaign of maximum pressure on sanctions that's devastated Iran's economy. But such sanctions have neither halted Iran's regional activities in Lebanon, Yemen or Iraq, nor made it any more flexible on nuclear issues.

On the other hand, his tough rhetoric withstanding, Trump has made clear many times that he'd like to sit with Iranian President Rouhani, presumably to negotiate a new and better nuclear deal. And risk averse when it comes to confronting Iran directly, he chose not to respond by striking Iran in retaliation for its attacks on Saudi oil facilities last September.

As we enter 2020 and an election year, it's unlikely that this confusion will end anytime soon, raising serious questions about what Trump really wants -- to weaken Iran, change the regime or cut a new nuclear deal.

Trump, who ran on a platform of withdrawing from the Middle East and would just as soon get out of these unwinnable wars, faces a genuine conundrum: how to avoid looking weak but avoid triggering a messy conflict with Iran and deeper involvement in Iraq that would be certain to alienate his base and energize his opponents.

On Tuesday night, Trump threatened that Iran would pay a ""big price"" for the embassy storming. But it remains to be seen whether this is characteristic Trumpian bluster, or an uncharacteristic threat from the President that actually leads to a more aggressive American response to Iran.

More than 50 groups co-signed a letter urging the social media giant to pull the ads from its Facebook and Instagram platforms and address the misinformation it was spreading.

Gilead had applauded the organizations standing up for their communities. “We join calls to have any misleading advertisements related to Gilead’s HIV medications removed from Facebook,"" Gilead SVP Amy Flood said in a December statement to FiercePharma.

According to the latest news reports, LGBTQ organizations led by GLAAD originally notified Facebook of the problematic ads in September. It wasn't until after an open letter was published in December and more widespread media coverage began that Facebook decided to call in the independent fact-checker, according to the Washington Post.

In an assessment published December 24, Facebook fact-checking partner Science Feedback concluded that the ad overstated the risks in taking Truvada for PrEP.

Independent fact-checkers found “some of the ads in question mislead people about the effects of Truvada,” a Facebook spokeswoman told the Washington Post, and added that “as a result, we have rejected these ads and they can no longer run on Facebook.”

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Another Mississippi inmate has died at the hands of a fellow inmate, bringing the death toll to four in disturbances over the past week in the state prison system. The violence comes even as a federal judge has rejected claims that conditions in one Mississippi prison are unconstitutionally harsh.

Sunflower County Corner Heather Burton told The Associated Press a 32-year-old male prisoner died before noon Thursday at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. Burton said the inmate, whom she declined to identify pending notification of relatives, had multiple stab wounds.

Sunflower County Sheriff James Haywood said other inmates were injured. Deputies from multiple counties and state agencies responded to the sprawling and isolated Parchman prison, Haywood said. Inmates in a different unit than the one where the stabbing occurred set their cell block on fire, the sheriff said, speaking by cell phone from the prison. Haywood said the fire was put out and the inmates were under control.

“Everybody is up here and everything is calm and cool right now,” he said.

Mississippi Department of Corrections spokeswoman Grace Simmons Fisher later said nobody was hurt by the small fire that was set by an inmate, and no structural damage occurred. She said inmates were evacuated while the fire was extinguished, then moved back in.

Earlier in the week, prisons statewide were put under lockdown after what the department called a ""major disturbance"" Sunday at the South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Greene County. Inmate Terrandance Dobbins, 40, was killed and two others were hurt.

On Tuesday evening at Parchman, 25-year-old inmate Walter Gates died and several others were injured during a fight among prisoners. The fight broke out in one unit and spread to others around the prison, Burton told news outlets. Burton said Gates, who had a 2015 burglary conviction, received multiple stab wounds.

Then one inmate was killed and two were injured in a fight early Thursday at Chickasaw County Regional Correctional Facility, a county-run facility that holds state inmates.

“We had it under control in three minutes,” Chickasaw County Sheriff Jim Meyers told The Associated Press.

Meyers identified the dead inmate as 26-year-old Gregory Emary, of Hernando, serving a 16-year sentence for burglary.

Another inmate was in intensive care after surgery at a Tupelo hospital, Meyers said, and a third was at another hospital with cuts to the head.

The lockdown means inmates can't go outside, make phone calls or receive visitors. Authorities said the ban on visitors will extend at least through the weekend.

“All available resources are being used to address disturbances occurring around the state,” the statement said.

The violence came even as U.S. District Judge William Barbour ruled Tuesday that while conditions may have previously been poor at East Mississippi Correctional Facility near Meridian, there's no longer any evidence that the privately run prison is violating inmates' rights.

A lawsuit suit filed in 2013 alleged that inmates were being systematically denied health care and mental health care, were in danger of violence from guards and other prisoners, and were forced into long stretches in solitary confinement, where cells were often dark and where inmates often set fires.

“While plaintiffs and their expert witnesses argue that environment and healthcare services at the prison could and should be better, those arguments do not establish that the conditions under which they are currently housed, as a class, are cruel and unusual,” Barbour wrote in his ruling.

The judge wrote that he believed that conditions had improved after former Corrections Commissioner Christopher Epps resigned in November 2014. Epps was later convicted of taking more than $1.4 million in bribes. One of those who pleaded guilty to bribing Epps was Dr. Carl Reddix, whose company previously had a contract to provide medical and mental health care at East Mississippi. Barbour said that the bribes “likely affected the quality of care that was being provided to prisoners as well as other conditions at the facility.”

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of inmates by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Neither group, nor the state, immediately commented Thursday on the ruling. The Corrections spokeswoman Fisher didn't comment directly on the ruling but wrote in an email that “linking the ruling to what is going on now is plainly unfair.”

Expert witnesses testified that care at the prison, which holds male inmates who mostly have been diagnosed with mental illness, was substandard. But Barbour ruled the experts' opinions didn't reach the “very high bar” needed to prove that state officials were deliberately indifferent to inmates' needs. He wrote the state had improved health care, mental health care, staffing and the physical conditions at the prison during the course of the lawsuit.

Mississippi Corrections Commissioner Pelicia Hall announced Tuesday that she will resign in mid-January to take a private sector job signaling incoming Gov. Tate Reeves won't retain her upon taking office Jan. 14.

32902,720e702bde27fbfc6a9d79ad7fd71c58,"DEFENCE bosses have spent £15,000 in taxpayers’ cash on gender-neutral toilets, a freedom of information request has revealed.

Ministry of Defence has transformed 13 single-sex toilets into mixed bathrooms to cater for both men and women at the British Army’s headquarters in Monxton Road, Andover.

A Freedom of Information request has revealed that since 2018, defence chiefs spent £14,886 on the loos, whose signs have just the word “toilet”.

The move has been described as ‘flushing money down the drain’ by the Tax Payers’ Alliance think tank.

More than 2,000 military and civilian personnel are housed at the Army’s £44million headquarters.

The move is part of a plan to change the armed forces into a “gender-neutral organisation”, where a person’s sex is irrelevant.

Colonel Richard Kemp, former Commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, told The Daily Star: “It’s quite shocking the Army is being dragged into this world of political correctness.

“Given how stretched and how busy our forces are, it is surprising someone has time to worry about this sort of thing.”

All three of the UK’s armed forces are attempting to become gender-neutral organisations.

Last year, the Army has introduced ‘gender and age-neutral’ fitness tests to replace its old assessments which saw soldiers completing tasks including push-ups and sit-ups.

An MoD spokesman told the newspaper: “As a modern and inclusive employer, we provide a range of facilities for our staff and personnel.”

It comes as more schools are adapting their toilets to become gender-neutral.

Though parents and teachers have warned that the mixed-sex bathrooms have lead to some students feeling unsafe.

Girls who are menstruating are so anxious about sharing facilities with boys that some are staying at home for fear of being made to feel ‘period shame’, the Mail on Sunday reported in October.

With a growing number of both primary and secondary schools installing unisex toilets, some girls are risking infections by refusing to urinate all day.

Others are so fearful they have stopped drinking liquids at school, the newspaper reported.

The Home Office has also installed a number of gender-neutral loos in recent years.

Responding to a freedom of information request last year, it said they had ten toilets in total: two in their Wales office, three in London and five in Cardiff."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Deborah Anthony, Felicia Bland, Eleventh Street Baptist Church, New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, and Seventh Street Baptist Church filed the lawsuit in Warren Circuit Court saying the residents and church members are adversely affected, aggrieved, and injured by the decision of the city.

They say the original pre-application was to rezone the property from Two-Family Residential to Townhouse/Multi-Family Residential with apartments to be built.

The residents say the final application changed to General Business and the notice that was sent out did not reflect this change.

The change in zoning approved by Bowling Green City Commission would allow for the existing homes to be demolished and a commercial building for equipment storage to be built.

The residents and churches are asking for the decision of the city to be declared null and void. They are also asking for attorney's fees and costs.

Hamp Moore, who is representing the city in this case, spoke to 13 News saying, ""After the planning commission made that recommendation the city commission conducted at least two separate hearings to review that recommendation and voted to approve the recommendation of the planning commission and allow this small business use to move forward.""

The NAACP released the following statement regarding support of the ongoing litigation:

""On December 18. 2019, numerous plaintiffs filed a complaint in Warren Circuit Court, appealing a rezoning decision for portions of Kenton Street and Greenwood Alley, a historically and predominately African-American neighborhood. The basis of the appeal and complaint is a planning commission recommendation, which was approved by a 2-1 vote by the City Commission on November 19, 2019. The challenged recommendation allows for the rezoning of the impacted area from residential to general business by demolishing existing homes and replacing them with contractor garages. Plaintiffs are requesting that the Court declare the decision of the City null and void.

Included in the appeal and complaint are numerous due process violation allegations, such as not properly noting the disapproval of the objecting African-American residents at the planning commission hearing. Plaintiffs additionally allege that the planning commission failed to follow numerous requirements of the Comprehensive Plan in making its recommendation, such as considering suitable low and moderate income housing before demolishing existing homes.

The Bowling Green/Warren County branch of the NAACP is committed to the principal objectives of “ensuring the political educational, social, and economic equality of all citizens,” and to “seek enactment and enforcement of federal, state, and local laws in securing civil rights.” The branch is concerned about the alleged violations and is carefully monitoring this case, especially as a number of its members are adversely impacted by the rezoning decision. The branch encourages that all zoning decisions be a result of a fair process that considers the needs and well-being of all residents—particularly those who are more vulnerable to the impacts of displacement.

33009,29b1a5575463d07ed48523474939916f,"In 1972, Stone Age Economics, by anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, appeared.

It came out in France in 1976 under the title Stone Age, Age of Plenty. The aim of the author is to deconstruct what he considers to be conventional wisdom about the disadvantages of primitive societies and the advantages of industrial civilization. He threw stones in a still pond by showing that the hunter-gatherers had a life full of abundance and less painful than the settled peoples did.

We learn indeed that they worked only a few hours a day and were better nourished than the human beings who succeeded the Neolithic Revolution, agriculture, and the rise of more sedentary lives. The work had a resounding effect. According to left-wing anarchist and anthropologist David Graeber, Sahlins’s work had a decisive influence on the emergence of ecological, decreasing, and primitivist movements in the 1970s.1 The conclusion of this story is a priori confusing and poses a real question: why the heck have human beings settled down, since this has led them to work more to earn less? Are humans as rational as they claim?

Hunter-Gatherers and Malthusianism

However, the suspicions of irrationality seem to dissipate if we include in our equation the question of the sustainability of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Economists Douglass North and Robert Paul Thomas describe the problem well when they point out that hunter-gatherers acted like parasites.1 They staged a vast tragedy of the commons.

They add no richness to what nature spontaneously offers. They have every incentive to overexploit it in the absence of well-defined property rights. Finally, they are subject to diminishing returns and heavy demographic constraints. Wherever they go, their resources are dead. More and more scientists believe that the hunting activities of prehistoric man are at least partially responsible for the extinction of the megafauna of the Pleistocene.2

It is now believed that it is this fragile sustainability that led the hunter-gatherer populations to resort to drastic Malthusian practices to limit their demography: prolonged breastfeeding by women, consumption of contraceptives and abortifacients, abstinence, wars, and, above all, routine infanticides. Some studies suggest that “intra- and intergroup killings routinely wiped out more than 5% of the population per generation.”3 Anthropologist Joseph Birdsell estimates that the rate of infanticide during the Pleistocene was between 15 and 50 percent of the total number of births and women seem to have been more targeted by this kind of abuse.45

The intellectuals who most idealize the hunter-gatherer lifestyle do not deny the frequent use of infanticides. Anthropologists like James C. Scott or Marshall Sahlins, however, attribute this behavior to the logistical constraints of nomadism, incompatible with the presence of too many young children.6 But these assertions, which slightly twist the neck with the dominant literature, join in finding the problem of durability. Because it is the depletion of resources that forces hunter-gatherers to migrate continuously.

The Invention of Agricultural Capitalism: An Ecological Response to the Excesses of Hunter-Gatherers?

The emancipatory fraternity of the first primitive communities and their harmony with nature thus prove to be a fable. The relative idleness which characterizes the primitive and free way of life was obtained only at the price of actions intended to compensate for an unsustainable management of the substances available in the wild. It was not until the Neolithic era that this problem was circumvented by the institution of agriculture.

Agriculture inaugurates several major upheavals. It introduced the first forms of land, plant, and animal property for the purposes of domestication, conservation, and sustainable production. Man ceases to be a mere consumer. He becomes a producer.

It is therefore logical that it [humanity] also ceases to perceive itself as a parasite and that it allows itself to form more densely populated communities. The density of hunter-gatherer communities was generally around 0.1 people per square mile (2,590 square kilometers), with the exception of the more resource-intensive areas. It is estimated that the first forms of agriculture allowed this density to be multiplied by at least forty.7

Agriculture humanizes family relationships. It reduces the need to resort to infanticide. In the words of libertarian anthropologist James C. Scott, “Sedentary farmers were experiencing unprecedented reproductive rates.”8

Private Property, Mother of Ecology

The property rights that emerged with the agricultural revolution were therefore born from the demographic constraints that inevitably arose from the environmental excesses inherent in the way of life of primitive societies. What lessons can we learn from this story?

The fable of the good savage remains a myth. Civilization based on the principle of private property is not the enemy of sustainable development. On the contrary, it is societies that despise or ignore private property that expose themselves to Malthusian tragedies and abuses.

Private property is, finally, a force of responsibility and conservation. All of the endangered species are now wild species while domesticated animals, especially for food, have never been so numerous. The challenge of resource conservation is therefore to introduce domestication — and private property — wherever possible.

Riding the high tide across global markets, the pan-European stocks index STOXX 600 jumped 0.9 per cent after declining for two straight sessions when caution crept in about how long a US-China trade truce would last.

But US President Donald Trump brightened the mood on Tuesday by saying the Phase 1 agreement would be signed on January 15 at the White House.

That lifted the wider French index 1.1pc. Bank-heavy Spanish and Italian indices gained the most in the region, up around 1.4pc each, while German shares posted their best day in one month, shrugging off figures that showed the manufacturing sector contracted further in December.

2020 is going to be a thrilling year for the X-Men. Dawn Of X is in full force, and while the quality of titles varies, there’s no shortage of big ideas to be explored in the future. This week’s X-books, X-Men and Marauders, highlight the incredible potential of the new status quo established by Jonathan Hickman, establishing mutants as a formidable political power on the world’s stage. Excalibur occupies its own distinct space as the series where the fantasy genre intersects with superheroes, with writer Tini Howard, artist Marcus To, colorist Erick Arciniega, and letterer Cory Petit exploring how mutants fit within the mystical landscape of the Marvel Universe. Under the leadership of Betsy Braddock, the new Captain Britain, Excalibur is the Earth’s main line of defense against threats from Otherworld, a realm of magical creatures ruled by the sorceress Morgan le Fay. But there’s also some weird shit going on with Apocalypse, who has taken a strong interest in this group to advance his own mysterious agenda.

Part of Apocalypse’s plan involves Rogue, who has been stuck in floral stasis for the last three issues. Given the prominence of fantasy imagery, it’s fitting that Rogue would end up as a sleeping beauty, and it’s time to find out what’s going on with her in next week’s Excalibur #5. This exclusive preview begins with some delightful banter between Betsy and Pete Wisdom, the horn- dog secret agent whose alliance rests with his home country of England rather than the new mutant nation of Krakoa. To and Arciniega’s artwork is animated and energetic, with crystal clear detail and robust characterizations that enrich Howard’s scripts. The layouts and coloring change dramatically for the Rogue scene, reinforcing a shift in consciousness as we take a journey into Rogue’s mind. Rogue’s costume here p ulls from her previous looks to give her a flowing garment with a strong princess vibe, and one of the coolest things about this series is how it folds these fairy tale elements into the new mutant world order.

33050,8fd236f6ecd082720204a4923a0a5fc1,"On the women of Idlib, the challenges they face and their resolve to continue

Anna Fleischer is program coordinator at the Heinrich Böll Foundation's Beirut office. She is particularly interested in gender justice and grass-roots movements, with a special focus on Syria.

Today is a sad day for the people of Idlib.

Many areas in the province’s south lay in ruins, entire streets demolished by intense bombardment. Houses, community centers, schools have been razed to the ground.

However, this is not the first time that the women of Idlib have asked themselves how their families will survive. In fact, they’ve been asking themselves this question every single day, watching as the bombs have fallen around them on a daily basis for the past eight months. Will they be able to leave the house today? Should they stay home and console their children?

Living with these intense, daily fears over the course of eight years of brutal war and emotional and physical devastation, the small daily deeds of Idlib's women have become heroic tasks.

When peaceful protests first began in Syria in 2011, Idlib saw its own developments rapidly unfold. Civil society movements and local self-administration initiatives blossomed and soon made the traditionally conservative province in Syria’s northwest a leading example of resistance against Assad. And in contrast to Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta, Idlib until today has resisted the grasp of the regime.

However, the people pay a heavy price. More than a million internally displaced persons have sought refuge in Idlib, and worse still is the fact that Syrian and Russian forces have been heavily bombarding the province since April.

Everyday heroic acts

Most of the media coverage on Idlib focuses on the military aspect, but this distracts us from the fact that the majority of those trapped in Idlib are civilians—according to the UN, more than 99 percent of them, to be exact. How do these people survive day to day, under constant bombardment and with no way out? Those who claim that there are “no good people” left in Syria fail to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of women and men struggling each day to achieve their vision of a more just Syria and who somehow keep civilian life going.

One of the civil society organisations formed when protests began is called Women Now for Development, a women’s rights organisation run by Syrian women. The organisation offers women and girls educational courses, psycho-social support and leadership training in community centers. Devastatingly, one of the buildings that recently fell victim to the fierce bombing of the past week was the Women Now center in Maarat a-Numan, which first opened its doors in 2014. The Maarat a-Numan center was a vibrant space for learning, exchanging and community support.

For more than three years, I've supported these women in their struggle for participation and freedoms in Syria. So I know that the daily heroic acts of these women are missing from the discussion on Syria.

After the chemical attack on Khan Sheikoun in April 2017, I opened voice message after voice message from one of my colleagues, who was describing the horrors that were unfolding. One of the women told me that her husband worked in the only hospital in the nearby town of Maarat a-Numan. Whatever he tried, and no matter how much he washed them, he could not get the poisonous chemicals off the victims. When he finally returned home at night, completely exhausted, his wife and children felt a burning in their eyes because the chemicals had clung to his skin and clothing.

Back then, many local organisation were considering suspending their activities. The women fiercely protested.

No matter the danger, they were still determined. “Every minute that we spend sitting at home waiting is much worse than the danger out there. Waiting is worse than death,” she said.

These everyday heroic acts are a necessity to keep normal life running—especially for the children, who often don’t know anything but war.

Abir in Idlib wrote in May 2019: “Our area was hit three times at 5am yesterday, we're sleeping in the hallway while the kids are sleeping in the bathroom. It's safer in the bathrooms as there are two ceilings on the top rather than one. My daughter is one year and a half, she's terrified by the loud bombardment. I keep telling my daughter that it's a game, and every time a military plane passes by, I tell her: 'Get ready for the bang, they're playing with us!’”

The mothers play down their own fears to make the children believe things are normal. Things have not been normal for almost 10 years now.

When working with women inside Syria, childcare is especially important. Women Now's centers offer childcare so that women can participate in the courses safe in the knowledge that their children are being well cared for. They also represent an alternative to the completely devastated infrastructure in Idlib—for example in Saraqeb, a town that has been particularly plagued by war.

A child-minder there, Bushra, remembered: “When the bombing began yesterday, we were at the center and the children were at day care, far from their mothers. That meant they were twice as frightened as they would have otherwise been. More than 20 children crowded around me, crying and screaming loudly. It was not long before each mother had come and taken her child. But for those few short minutes when I was alone with the children, I wanted nothing more than to have arms so long that I could embrace each and every one of them and make them feel safe.”

'We will go on, no matter what!'

In one of the few short breaks in the military campaign against rebel-held Idlib that has been raging for well over half a year, I received a curious image. In the picture, there was a turtle and hands in victory signs. One of the teachers in the center had decided to take the short break to take her children outside. They had been hiding in their homes for days, sometimes even under their beds. When the bombardment became less vicious, the children started begging their mothers to go outside. Since it was the end of Ramadan, she caved and took them into nature. They found the turtle on the ground and took the picture to show that there is still normal life in Idlib. It was another heroic act. “The children should live normally as far as it is possible. We love life!”

People often ask me: “What is next for Syria?""

The women have a clear answer: “We will go on, no matter what!”

They do not want to surrender, to give in. They have fought for a lot, and achieved a lot, in the last few years that they don’t want to give up. They have taken on new tasks previously done only by men, but which they have taken on since many of the men are now either deceased, detained or severely traumatised. This makes them all the more determined with regards to the Assad regime, which they never want to live under ever again. This is precisely the same regime that they revolted against, a regime that tortures and oppresses.

As Nebal, one of Women Now's French language teachers, put it: “The same war that killed many things in us also killed our fear of many things.”

Looking at these small, everyday heroic acts by the women of Idlib gives us a clearer idea about the future of Syria than just obsessively analysing the militias, armies and terrorists in the conflict.

Despite all the hardships, the incredible will for a better future of the people has been clear to see in recent weeks. Whenever the fighter jets take a break from bombing civilians, people return to the streets to demand their freedom and the fall of Assad. This rebellious spirit has not been broken by almost 10 years of brutal war.

But it's that same spirit that will shape the future of the country. In the video published by Women Now showing the bombed-out center, the caption reads: “This is not the future we waited for, and this can’t be the end.”

The regime may have militarily won back most of Syria, but the hearts of its people will never be conquered.

33255,7efab37b834d65db3293222dbe9f2edb,"As 2020 is off to a rebellious start, a wave of struggles with growing intensity continues to sweep across the globe, from Chile to Hong Kong. People are rising up against government repression and austerity measures, or trying to defend themselves from right-wing coups. None of these uprisings are simple or homogeneous; some include elements anti-capitalists may strongly disagree with, and the necessity of self-defense against the advances of the far-right often puts us in a position of defending left-wing governments we may have well founded criticisms of.

When these complexities and critiques are brought up, the ensuing debate usually devolves into a total polarization in which one side denies any possible criticism and the other side prioritizes their criticism over solidarity. As an end result of this kind of posturing, each side denies legitimacy to the other and claims their own position is above reproach. But criticism is oxygen for the struggle. Revolutionary movements that do not honestly consider their own weaknesses are setting themselves up for failure. And when a movement cannot develop relevant responses to a situation of growing misery and exploitation, when it betrays the dreams that launched it in the first place, it is paving the way for the right to come back with a vengeance.

We can do better than this. In order to extend effective solidarity, we need to identify some principles and patterns that will help us achieve this.

Urgency and Proportionality

When people are dying in the streets, questions of survival need to take priority. This means understanding the alliances people make in context. A progressive political party making a tacit alliance with a far-right party to stay in power another term — as happened after the last elections in Barcelona — is an entirely different kind of pragmatism than Kurdish fighters accepting US aid in a fight for their very survival against ISIS and Turkey, or anticapitalist protesters in Hong Kong, facing a brutal onslaught by police and an extradition law that promises future repression, fighting alongside those who want a liberal political system in the US sphere of influence.

We should be honest about the complexities of a struggle and openly discuss the authoritarian tendencies of certain allies, while keeping things in perspective and correctly identifying who presents an immediate threat to our survival or freedom, or that of the people we are trying to support from a distance.

People in Bolivia have been fighting in the streets for the future of their country. The mostly Indigenous protesters opposed to the coup that ousted Evo Morales have already suffered massacres and disappearances, while the groups behind the coup are receiving support from the US and right-wing governments in the OAS. Which is the bigger threat right now; specific policies of Morales over the past ten years that damaged Indigenous autonomy and destroyed large swathes of rainforest, or the evangelist, neo-fascist political groups with military and paramilitary support that want to annihilate Indigenous cultures, subjugate all the working class and indigenous people in Bolivia who have been fighting for their dignity, and accelerate the despoliation of the earth? Obviously, the latter.

In a somewhat similar vein, anarchists in Ukraine had to find a coherent, effective position in the 2014 Maidan movement and the subsequent outbreak of war in Donbas. On the one side, there was a heterogeneous alliance of Ukrainian progressives, centrists and fascists, most of whom favored a closer relationship with the EU. On the other side were Russian nationalists, Stalinists and fascists — and the Russian military. Anti-capitalists from the region tend to be critical of both the EU and Moscow, as well as fascists of any stripe.

The debate largely centers around prioritizing different threats. One relevant argument holds that Russia is the dominant imperialist power in that part of the world, and people are safer if they remain outside its orbit. Russia and its client states like Belarus routinely arrest, torture and assassinate anarchists and other dissidents. A large part of the movement has had to flee into exile, and it is pertinent that Ukraine is one of the relatively safe countries they flee to.

Any criticism of the different positions comrades adopt that does not take into account very real questions of survival with regards to Ukrainian and Russian fascists as well as Russian police actions is liable to be ignored by those who personally face those dangers.

Survival must be a priority. But we also have to keep in mind that as long as capitalism controls our survival, it cannot be the chief compass point for revolutionary struggles. There is also an important criticism to be made of survival in a liberal, individualistic sense: the survival of our specific bodies, and not the survival of our dreams and desires, the survival of our communities, cultures, or histories.

While we fight for our survival and that of allies near and far, we also need to create other paths of struggle so that the very way we live increasingly takes on revolutionary implications. Otherwise, we will always be sacrificing long-term considerations for short-term necessities. If survival means continuously supporting the latest government or political party that won’t put us on the chopping block so quickly, we will never be able to contest capitalist designs on our lives.

For survival to be a revolutionary consideration, it must also include the survival of our communities, histories and dreams.

Who is the Protagonist?

“The people” or another more specific but equally essentialist category almost always make an appearance in debates around how to position ourselves with respect to a complex conflict. There is an authoritarian habit of claiming to speak on their behalf, of justifying our own position as the only one that is in the interests of said people.

It is quite possible that the first time in history the term “the people” was used in a politically effective way, it was already a manipulation: segments of the bourgeoisie, legitimizing their own interests and justifying a most profitable change to the structures of government and society, namely, giving property owning males the vote, privatizing land and enclosing the commons under the guise of abolishing the privileges of Church and aristocracy. They included themselves as part of “the people,” the new source of political legitimacy, even though they had very little in common, and a great deal of antagonism, with most of the other people included in that group.

Nonetheless, many on the left still use this term uncritically, without acknowledging that any iteration of a “people” is a multifaceted, shifting, fluid, heterogeneous group with no consensus, no fixed interests, and with their own voices, their own capacity to constantly redefine their interests.

This essentialist operation smoothes over — or tramples down — the many ever-changing differences between people, because to represent a group you must first deprive it of its own multitude of voices. And you cannot climb onto the backs of a group of people and steal the power they generate without claiming at some level to represent them.

When it is a case of someone making essentialist statements in support of a distant group they do not belong to, it is obvious how this is problematic. But it can also be problematic when people position themselves as representatives of a group they actually belong to.

This is by no means a call for liberal atomization. “Individuals” are probably an even more artificial category than most groups (topic for a whole other article, but if you even just take, say, respiration, immune systems, or knowledge, no one functions as an individual; rather, we function as a part of networks that include all living things; nobody breathes without trees or learns without those who came before us). It is instead a call for nuance, a distinction between speaking up for collective experiences, and implying that everyone in a collective agrees with us or can be represented by us.

It is inevitable to use simplifying phrases like, “solidarity with the Bolivian people.” Already, we are leaving out the racist evangelists and capitalists who also make up a part of the Bolivian people, though when one sector of a society attacks and dominates the rest, espousing a racist and classist logic, they are asking to be discounted. Whether or not we are a part of the group in question, we should be clear these are our values — values we are happy to explain and defend — that justify delegitimizing a group of people.

But when we go a step further and claim “those who do not support Morales are anti-Indigenous” or “those who do not vote for Obama (or, as will probably be the case in 2020, a white Democratic candidate) are racist,” we are insisting in an underhanded way not only that all Indigenous or all Black people have a similar experience of racism, but that all of them believe in the same strategy for change, and it just so happens to be the strategy we espouse.

This is an authoritarian operation, silencing all the revolutionary Indigenous and Black people, in these two examples, who have different ideas on resistance, and appropriating an extreme degree of unaccountable power as one claims to speak on behalf of so many others — unaccountable because they are obscuring the fact they are expressing their own values and instead imputing those values as the natural, essential belief of hundreds of millions of people.

This would be ridiculously horrible if I, a white person, were to do it, but it is still an essentialist, authoritarian operation that silences difference when someone does it within their own category. And those most likely to be silenced by this operation are those with the least access to institutional power and dominant technologies of communication.

Anti-Imperialist Realities

I have learned a great deal in conversation with a Venezuelan friend who is a Chavista. While she is more critical of Maduro, she believes that Chávez sincerely and effectively tried to use the state to support popular movements in Venezuela, while also maintaining and expanding petroleum extraction so that the country could acquire the foreign exchange needed for survival. She did not work for the government: her experience and her perspective is from the streets, from the popular movements.

She fully acknowledges that petroleum and coal extraction exacerbated conflicts with multiple Indigenous communities, but also that centuries of colonial and neocolonial economic structuring meant that the country was utterly dependent on global capital flows just to feed itself. This falls in line with Walter Rodney’s analysis of the Soviet Union and the possibility for socialism in Africa: a revolution within a country does not entirely save that country from occupying a colonial or extractivist niche within the global capitalist economy.

This view is not by any means a free pass for authoritarian socialists; rather, it requires us to make distinctions between different degrees and strategies of authoritarianism. In my friend’s experience, Chávez was valuable to popular movements precisely because he gave those movements space to grow and temporarily kept the racist aristocracy off their backs, but it was primarily the movements that were making things better, though government resources played an important role.

On the contrary, the Soviet Union quickly curtailed the autonomy of the social movements and soon crushed those movements altogether. It is worth noting that the state unopposed proved to be the quickest path back to capitalism. But in Venezuela under Chávez, though the government did resort to violence against those who opposed it, as all governments do, it also adopted a wholly different relationship with social movements.

Venezuela is different from Bolivia; Evo focused on institutionalizing the movements rather than empowering them, and did not hesitate to attack them when they protested some policy of his. Again, this approach is not the same as that practiced in socialist Russia, China or Cuba, but the frictions and disappointments it caused can also help explain the early success of the coup against Morales.

I can recognize the reality of my Chavista friend’s experiences without believing states are an appropriate tool for revolutions. I can argue that government, private property and wage labor are themselves intrinsically colonial forms antithetical to liberation. That it is all but inevitable for a competent bureaucrat like Maduro to follow a charismatic visionary like Chávez, and similarly for a Stalin to follow a Lenin.

I can argue that a total rupture with the global capitalist economy — which no socialist state has ever undertaken and which no government is structurally capable of accomplishing — is actually the only hope for a real revolution. I can use the example of the great revolutionary gains when peasants and workers won their autonomy, free from the state, in Ukraine in 1919, in Shinmin Province in Manchuria from 1929 to 1931, in Catalonia and Aragón in 1936, every single time crushed not by the right, but by an authoritarian left that to this day is allergic to criticism.

I can also point to the much more recent example of the período especial in Cuba, in the ‘90s, when people subjected to a total blockade organized their own survival at the margins of a government on the edge of collapse, afraid to get in their way.

I can fervently believe that an anti-state strategy is the best one in all of these cases. But that belief is irrelevant if I do not also recognize that it is a question of life and death if a country cuts itself off from global capitalism without transforming its economy. As such, many people will prefer to keep one foot in either world, despite the difficulties and as yet unresolved dilemmas that strategy entails.

Common Enemies

In closing, I want to offer an image, a proposal, that transcends facile polemics. Despite our disagreements, would we stand on the same side of the barricades? Who among us would not be on the same side if we were suddenly together in Bolivia, at Standing Rock, in Charlottesville, in Ferguson, in Chile, in Lebanon? We would not all go to the same protests, not all the time, nor participate in the same initiatives, but when things got hot, when on the other side of the street it was the cops, the fascists, shooting at us, getting ready to charge, I would like to think we would fight together, looking out for one another’s survival.

Those who do the most to keep these flame wars going are ensconced behind computer screens or in ivory towers and do not have to face situations of actual danger. But the rest of us have long become accustomed to the impoverished forms of solidarity favored by these types. On social media, a post insulting one faction or the other, denying their revolutionary credentials, gets passed around tens of thousands of times. Another one, suggesting we find which evangelical churches or private companies support the far-right in Bolivia, gets ignored.

A suggestion that we identify common enemies, power structures that all of us would oppose, who sow misery from the very poorest to the very richest of countries, would require us to give up our shallow posturing and take risks together, despite our differences.

The federal government says the average Alberta household will receive about $880 under the rebate program, which is about $170 more than it is expected to pay.

Schweitzer said he doesn’t believe that will be the case.

“I don’t buy that at all. Look at Albertans right now. Alberta is struggling. We need jobs in this province,” he said.

“The cost of everything is going to start going up.”

The four-cent increase represents a carbon tax of $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide, increasing to $30 in the spring.

Those who live in small or rural communities will receive a higher rebate, and fuel used for farm machinery can be exempted from the tax.

Municipalities, public institutions, small businesses and Indigenous communities are also to receive extra funding to help them lower their energy costs.

Alberta is challenging the federal tax in the province’s Court of Appeal. Arguments were heard in December and the court has yet to rule.

Ontario and Saskatchewan lost previous challenges of the tax in their top courts and are appealing to the Supreme Court of Canada. Alberta is supporting them in their legal action.

“We’re waiting to see what the Alberta Court of Appeal’s decision will have in the New Year. And we’re hoping to have that decision done before the Supreme Court case, which is going to be heard in March,” Schweitzer said.

“We’re going to keep that fight going. This is federal overreach plain and simple. This is clearly provincial jurisdiction.”

Alberta had a consumer carbon tax under the previous New Democrat government, which was rescinded by the United Conservatives in May. The government has since imposed a carbon tax of $30 a tonne on industrial emitters, which has been approved by Ottawa.

“Alberta is doing its part to tackle global emissions. Our plan invests in real technological solutions. It doesn’t punish people for driving to work and heating their homes,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Tuesday on Twitter.

He said his government won’t relent in its legal fight against the consumer tax.

“We won’t roll over like the previous NDP government did. This is Alberta’s jurisdiction, and we will fight for it.”

Netanyahu on Wednesday filed a request with Edelstein for immunity in the three cases against him, defending the decision, which has proved controversial with some voters, as protection from “trumped-up charges.”

The premier has been charged with fraud and breach of trust in all three cases and bribery in one of them.

But opposition parties want to discuss the request immediately, despite the Knesset having disbanded in December, with the hope of the plenum rejecting it, thus allowing the premier’s trial to begin. However, a source close to Netanyahu claimed that Edelstein will prevent a Knesset discussion weighing the request before the March vote at a minimum.

Though the premier seems unlikely to get a Knesset majority to support an immunity bid, merely asking for it will likely delay any potential trial by months.

Under a 2005 change to the Knesset immunity law, members of the legislature no longer receive automatic immunity from prosecution. They have to request it from the plenum when relevant.

Netanyahu’s request must first by weighed by the Knesset House Committee before it can be voted upon by the plenum. But due to the lack of a functioning legislature amid ongoing political deadlock, and with new elections set, there is currently no working House Committee.

The Knesset will likely only be able to review and decide on Netanyahu’s request after a coalition is formed — if there is one finally — following the March 2 vote.

Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s chief rivals in the Knesset, Blue and White, are seeking to expedite the process. Blue and White MK Avi Nissenkorn asked Edelstein to swiftly call a meeting of the Knesset Arrangements Committee, which Nissenkorn heads, to discuss the possibility of forming a House Committee under the special circumstances to discuss Netanyahu’s request.

“We have wanted for a long time now to form a House Committee and Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein opposes it,” said Nissenkorn. “When the prime minister asks for immunity we should honor that request and hold a discussion on the matter. The Knesset is not a shelter [from prosecution].”

Blue and White said Nissenkorn had sought to call a meeting of the Arrangements Committee on Thursday to discuss the possibility of forming a House Committee to debate Netanyahu’s request.

But when he made the request for Edelstein to approve it, the speaker responded that he was abroad until the weekend, and wanted to meet with the Knesset’s legal adviser first. The Arrangements Committee, which deals with procedural parliamentary issues such as the makeup of other committees, can only convene with a green light by Edelstein.

Edelstein said that he would meet with Knesset legal adviser Eyal Yinon early next week and then decide whether the Arrangements Committee should convene.

Blue and White called his response a “shameful attempt to prevent the Knesset from discussing Netanyahu’s immunity request,” in a statement issued Wednesday.

Yinon said that the committee could be formed if a majority of the Knesset supports the move in a vote, but Avigdor Liberman, whose Yisrael Beytenu holds the balance of power in the parliament, has said he will vote against its creation. Blue and White said it is trying to convince him to support it.

In a letter to Yinon, Netanyahu loyalist MK Miki Zohar claimed that to convene a House Committee at this stage would be “unconstitutional” and “in contravention of all democratic principles.”

While Netanyahu has stated publicly that he is not seeking to avoid trial and that “immunity is always temporary,” his attorneys wrote in their letter to Edelstein that he was asking for functional immunity in one of the three cases against him as well as in certain aspects of another.

Functional immunity protects parliamentarians from prosecution for things they did in fulfilling their parliamentary work, and is permanent, rather than temporary.

Netanyahu on Wednesday claimed that there exists a conspiracy against him, accusing authorities of engaging in “trumped-up charges, selective enforcement, blackmail of state’s witnesses” and more. He asserted that exonerating information was “being held in the shadows under gag orders and attorney general decisions.”

An uneasy calm enveloped the U.S. Embassy in Iraq on Thursday as new images from the scene revealed extensive damage following days of sometimes violent protests by Iranian-backed militia members and their supporters.

The photos show a burned and charred reception area, smashed windows and vandalized rooms left behind by supporters and members of the Iranian-trained Hashed al-Shaabi military network, also known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. No deaths or serious injuries have been reported, and the embassy was not evacuated.

The Pentagon sent hundreds of troops to the region, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would delay a trip to Central Asia and Europe to focus on ""the ongoing situation in Iraq and ensure the safety and security"" of Americans there.

""We’ll continue cooperation (with Iraq) to hold Iran and its proxies responsible,"" Pompeo said.

The embassy protest erupted Tuesday, two days after U.S. airstrikes killed at least two dozen Iran-backed fighters in Iraq.Demonstrators shouting ""Death to America!"" smashed their way into the embassy compound and set fire to a reception area as U.S. combat helicopters swooped over the complex.

Militia leaders with the Popular Mobilization Forces ultimately ordered supporters to retreat, declaring the demonstration a win in the battle to expel U.S. troops from Iraq.

“After achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly,” said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. “We rubbed America’s nose in the dirt.”

Protests are nothing new in Baghdad, but most have targeted the Iraqi government and what Sunni Iraqis view as meddling by Iran's Shiite government.

James Piazza, a Penn State political science professor specializing in the Islamic world, said the clashes underscore the struggle in Iraq between the Shiite majority – long oppressed under Saddam Hussein – and Sunnis who make up about one-third of the nation of 40 million people.

""The PMF has vowed further acts of revenge against the U.S. for the airstrikes,"" Piazza told USA TODAY. ""It may become impossible for the Iraqi government to balance Sunnis and Shiites.""

Kirsten Fontenrose, former senior director for Gulf affairs at the National Security Council, said Iraqis should demand their government not follow the political path Iran has taken.

“It’s up to Iraqis who see a different future for themselves, to demand that their government rein in actors who want to impose on them this very un-Iraqi plan for the country,"" Fontenrose said. ""They can’t expect Americans to remain in the country as targets while the remnants of their government enable Iran’s thugs.”

Raed Jarrar, an Iraqi-born activist now based in Washington, D.C., said most Iraqis want an end to all foreign intervention. Jarrar said the embassy protest was clearly orchestrated by the Iran-backed militia, but that the U.S. should not respond by escalating its proxy war against Iran in Iraq.

""The U.S. and Iran are seen by the majority of Iraqis as partners in crime when it comes to supporting these sectarian militias,"" Jarrar said. ""The right move is to de-escalate, withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq, and end U.S. military aid to the Iraqi government and its deadly sectarian militias.""

Pompeo defended the airstrikes as a ""decisive response"" to weeks of militia rocket attacks targeting Iraqi bases that host U.S. troops, including one Friday that killed a U.S. contractor. Sunday's ""defensive"" airstrikes targeted three sites in Iraq and two in Syria that included weapon storage facilities and command and control locations, the Pentagon said.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said 750 soldiers were immediately deployed to the region. At Fort Bragg in North Carolina, hundreds of paratroopers boarded C-17 aircraft as part as the Immediate Response Force. Esper said additional soldiers from the force are prepared to deploy over the next several days.

“The United States will protect our people and interests anywhere they are found around the world,” Esper said.

President Donald Trump, on Twitter, accused Iran of orchestrating the embassy violence and warned that Iran ""will pay a very BIG PRICE!""

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, dismissed allegations of Iranian involvement. Hossein Salami, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, was unmoved by Trump's warning of repercussions.

""Firstly, you can’t do a damn thing since this issue is not related to Iran, and secondly, you should be logical and come to find the root causes,"" General Salami said in Tehran. ""The Americans should come to realize that people in the region, including in Iraq and Afghanistan, hate them for their crimes and this hatred surfaces somewhere.""

© Yana Paskova—The New York Times/Redux A gathering outside the home of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg on Dec. 29, where a man stabbed and wounded five people as they were gathering to light candles for Hanukkah, in Monsey, N.Y.

The family of an Orthodox Jewish man who was severely injured during a machete attack in Monsey, N.Y., on Saturday says that doctors fear he may never wake up.

Josef Neumann, 72, was among five people injured when a man brandishing a machete broke into a Hanukkah party at a rabbi’s home on Saturday. Neumann’s daughter, Nicky Kohen, told reporters on Thursday that physicians say that her father is unlikely to fully recover from multiple severe injuries.

Standing beside several of her seven siblings, Kohen said that Neumann is still unconscious after suffering a skull fracture, a cut through his neck and a shattered arm during the attack. She said the family decided to release a photo of their father after the attack so people could understand how serious his injuries — and the severity of the attack — was.

“We started realizing people did not understand the severity of this attack,” Kohen said. “When people ask, is he awake yet? Is he talking to you guys, and all I want to do is yell Do you realize the prognosis is right now is he really may never, ever speak again? Or wake up, or walk?… we did decide to release that photo, after much thought, so people that can realize how severe this attack was.”

The family released the following image of Neumann on Wednesday.

Kohen said that Neumann is currently undergoing surgery to insert a tracheostomy (trach) tube, a device doctors place into a patient’s windpipe, or trachea, to help them breathe.

Prosecutors have charged the suspect, Grafton E. Thomas, with five counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by attempting to kill with a dangerous weapon and causing injuries for the attack. In a federal criminal complaint, an FBI investigator said that Thomas had expressed ant-Semitic sentiments in a journal found in his home.

The attack has added to concerns about an increase in anti-Semitic violence in recent weeks. In December, a pair of gunman shot and killed four people in an attack that allegedly targeted a Jewish grocery store in Jersey City, N.J. Last week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that he was increasing the police presence in three neighborhoods with many Jewish residents.

Kohen urged people listening to her message to stand up against hatred in its various forms. “We want our kids to go to school and face, we want to go to our synagogues and feel safe, we want to go to our groceries and malls and feel safe,” she said.

Kohen said that the family hopes that reporters will focus on her father and the other victims, instead of the suspect, in order to avoid encouraging other attacks.

33441,2be0b4b5bc1db24bc9cf2288617a2ce5,"The deceptively simple Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) may have life-saving lessons to share with the significantly more complex Homo sapiens, lessons that could lead to future changes in treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI).

According to a peer-reviewed research paper published recently in the journal Fly[1], results from studies at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay suggest three significant findings with potential implications for humans:

First, repetitive, moderate blows to the head at short intervals have potential for serious injury. There appears to be a cumulative effect from a series of moderate blows within a short time frame, which can be as harmful as a single significant blow.

Second, the time frame for increased harm caused by repeated injuries can operate at shorter timescales than has been previously appreciated. The research suggests that consideration must be paid to repetitive injuries that occur closely together.

Finally, TBI caused an initial impairment of motor coordination, temporary recovery, and then a second, delayed impairment before full recovery was achieved. Single severe injuries caused the same impairment as repetitive moderate blows. Thus, if only using coordination measures, there is a risk for improperly determining an individual has recovered from a TBI event, whether severe or moderate, at an early time-point, when in fact they are still in the process of fully recovering.

By now you’re probably asking, “All of this from a fruit fly?”

“That’s a question I get a lot,” smiles Doug Brusich, assistant professor of Human Biology and leader of the research team. “People wonder why we use fruit flies and how results from those studies can have any relevance to humans.”

Brusich recited the reasons with the ease of someone who has answered this question many times before:

“Fruit fly genes mirror human genes very closely,” said Brusich, “so while findings may not be completely analogous, they usually point us to something that might be worthy of further study in mammals, including humans.

“Their genes are also easier to work with than mammal genes,” he continued. “For example, where mammals might have nine genes that govern sodium channels, fruit flies have one. If you make a change in that sodium channel and observe a result, you have a potential indication of a similar importance in mammals.

“Fruit flies also breed quickly, from larvae to adults in 10 days, and have 80-day life cycles,” said Brusich, “so we can develop hundreds of flies for study in a relatively short time. And we can use flies at varying stages of their lives to see if age has any impact on the results.

“We also have to consider the financial and ethical aspects of our research,” he added. “Fruit flies are very inexpensive to maintain in the lab, especially compared to the cost of other potential subject animals like mice. And the ethical questions that arise when inflicting brain damage on flies are much less complex.

“It’s also important that the ways we produce injuries on flies in the lab is as similar to the ways humans experience TBIs,” Brusich concluded, “The results from fruit fly research come from impact and rotational forces that closely resemble forces humans might experience.”

Expanding the research to new levels

Brusich and his team at UW-Green Bay—former undergraduate student Lauren Putnam (2018), and current undergraduates Nathaniel Disher, Brooke Kalata and Ashley Willes—knew the literature contained well documented fruit fly studies of TBI based on single, high-impact strikes. They wondered, though, whether the methods in those studies could be used to study milder injuries, which are more common but less understood.

“There were two reasons we pursued this path,” explained Brusich. “First, mild head trauma is quite common and affects human health. Roughly 70-90% of the greater than 1.5 million annual TBI events resulting in hospital visits in the United States are classified as mild, however, just as many mild injuries are estimated to go unreported. Additionally, we have evidence that mild head injuries which fail to even meet classic criteria for a concussion result in changes in brain health.

“Second,” he continued, “mild injuries have so far been poorly studied or modeled by mammalian or fly models of TBI. This is in part because mild injuries don’t always generate noticeable outcomes. As a result, we have little information about mild TBI.

“Expanding our studies to reduced levels of severity opens the possibility of investigating similarities and/or differences in predisposition and consequences in response to severe versus mild TBI,” he concluded.

Is it dead or just sleeping?

Anyone who has swatted a house fly has seen the immediate effect of a (lucky) strike. The fly is temporarily stunned and may sit motionless for a short time before recovering and flying off to annoy you again.

It turns out the temporary disorientation we casually observe is one of the behaviors researchers look for after striking flies in the lab. They also have other behavioral clues to watch for and record.

But those clues are subtle and you can’t have a lab full of researchers swatting willy-nilly at a room full of flies that are smaller than a house fly’s wing. For one thing, the lab is only the size of a galley kitchen. For another, how would you observe and record any of the fruit flies’ behavior in such an environment? How do you set up a study that provides predictable levels of “swat” energy and enables recording of the results?

Brusich and his team arrived at a MacGyver-like solution by adapting a compression spring-powered device developed by researchers at UW-Madison specifically for fruit fly research. The original device produced a strike (a “swat”) by attaching a vial of 20 to 60 flies to the end of the 10-inch-long coil spring, affixing the spring horizontally to a padded surface, pulling the spring upward to a 90-degree deflection from the table, then releasing the spring to return to its horizontal position, stunning the flies in the vial.

This method has become known as the High-Impact Trauma (HIT) method and has been widely adopted in fly research.

For his team’s purpose, Brusich modified the device so it could reliably and accurately produce single or multiple strikes at 60-, 70-, 80- and 90-degree deflections. This enabled the team to examine the results of repetitive HIT events to about 34,000 fruit flies across varying levels of severity, from mild to severe.

The team also combined low-tech and high-tech solutions to study the fruit flies’ ability to walk (geotaxis) after TBI events. They used a plywood frame and elastic bands to hold several vials upright, then dropped the frame three times from a set height, forcing the flies to the bottom of the vial.

They then used a Logitech webcam to watch as the flies reacted: some scrambled to the top, some remained confused and some stayed at the bottom. Using screen shots and statistical modeling software, the flies’ actions were catalogued, timed and plotted.

The results of the study confirmed other researchers’ findings for severe TBI effects (strikes at 90-degree deflections) and produced the three novel results described above (arising from repetitive strikes at varying intervals that produce less severe, but cumulative, TBI effects).

“We were happy that our study produced results so consistent with what others had found,” said Brusich. “And we think the findings that resulted from expanding the methodology to less severe levels of TBI have potential implications for further study in fruit flies and mammals. Future findings could change the way we assess and treat TBI.”

From TBI to epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease

Brusich is already taking information from his TBI research into others areas of exploration.

“I initially got into studying epilepsy from experiments I conducted as part of my graduate thesis,” said Brusich. “I started using TBI in part to model post-traumatic epilepsy, which my lab is now studying. More broadly, TBI findings are relevant to aging and neurodegeneration, such as from dementias like Alzheimer’s, and so the more we learn from this model the better. TBI is also a trending topic in research, so the additional perks are that it is garnering more funding and becoming an attractive and enjoyable area of research for prospective students.

“I have long wanted my role to be a split research-teaching one at a primarily undergraduate school like UW-Green Bay,” he continued, “and the simple, low-cost set up of my lab is appropriate for undergraduate involvement. The supportive environment created by my dean and by the school in general has enabled us to carve out this niche for ourselves versus the research functions at some of the larger schools.”

Aspiring researchers welcome

Brusich hopes other students who share his passion for fundamental research will consider joining him.

“I always mention my research interests in the courses I teach and ask students to chat with me if they think they might be interested in research,” said Brusich.

“I compile a list of these students and others who have heard about the opportunity, then invite students from the list to interviews held once or twice a year. Students are always welcome to contact me (email is best) if they are interested in research.”

33474,ceb85aa20ac4ff7a758af1195675d0c8,"Binance Coin had a strong previous year, despite a poor ending

The price is trading below key technical indicators

Drop below the $10 handle may be on the cards soon

Binance coin (BNB) is setting up a technical pattern that may pave the way for a drop of around 25% in the coming weeks.

Fundamentals

Despite a strong previous year when the digital asset gained more than 120% in value, the coin has dropped almost 50% since November 2019. The fall may continue in January as well because of the negative technical picture that surrounds the BNB price action.

Arguably the strongest factor behind the rise of the BNB is its use case. Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, has designed BNB in a way that has a high degree of utility. The entire Binance ecosystem contains of Binance.com, Binance.US, the Binance DEX, Binance Launchpad, BEP2, and margin trading.

It was recently announced that Binance.US, Binance’s subsidiary for the market of the United States, has opened beta testing of its iOS application to all users. News such as this one directly contributes to the growth of Binance’s impressive ecosystem.

However, the success of the technical side of the project didn’t translate into the increased market value for Binance.

In July 2019, the founder of Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ), announced that Binance Coin is available for margin trading, with a sarcastic warning for traders not to sell the coin on the market.

#BNB is available for margin now. But I don't recommend shorting it, as you will get #REKT. https://t.co/qDDC9UywLO — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) July 18, 2019

Since CZ tweeted the announcement, the BNB has lost more than 50% of its value. Hence, if you did the opposite of his advice, you would have made a lot of money.

Technical analysis

Fundamentally, there is no clear indication as to why BNB performed poorly in the second half of the year. For this reason, we have to move to the technical analysis to better understand the reasoning behind such underperformance.

As seen in the chart below, the BNB price action is in a clear downtrend. Since June 2019, when the market peaked at $43.15, there has been a clear trend of lower highs, which indicates that the market is feeling strong pressure to the downside.

Binance Coin daily chart (TradingView)



Furthermore, the price action is also trading below two key technical indicators – the moving average. Given that the market has failed to move higher in a few attempts, we believe that BNB is well-positioned to continue to move lower.

For BNBUSD, the level around $14.50 is very important as it has played an influential market role in the past. Whenever the price falls below a certain important level, a re-test of the same level from the other side of the market is crucial for determining the future market behavior.

In this case, BNB failed to move back above this level which signals that sellers are still in control. Hence, the fact that we trade below $14.50 is a strong technical indicator that the market is poised to continue lower, barring any unforeseen circumstances.

If this scenario plays out, we believe that BNB will drop further to test next support levels behind the current market price. More specifically, we are looking at levels between $8.00 and $9.50 at least, as potential levels where BNB may head to in the short-term future."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Some 500-600 unnamed people have also been accused in the case.

Law enforcers picked up 29 people in connection with the case in the last two days.

Yesterday, a Bogura court sent the arrestees to jail after they were produced before it.

At least 11 people, including five policemen, were injured in a clash between Chhatra Dal men and police in Bogura town’s Khokon Park area on Wednesday over walking on the Shaheed Minar wearing shoes.

The JCD men had gathered in the area to join a programme marking the 41th founding anniversary of the organisation.

According to the case statement, the 75 accused, along with some 500-600 unidentified “leaders and activists”, attacked police, tried to snatch away their arms, snatched the trigger guard of a police rifle and beat up five cops with bamboo sticks during the incident.

Among the 75 accused are presidents and general secretaries of the JCD’s 12 upazila units in Bogura.

Speaking to The Daily Star yesterday, a local Chhatra Dal leader said police accused Al Razib, senior vice president of the student front’s Bogura town unit, in the case. But he had landed in jail on November 25 in another case, claimed the JCD leader.

Asked about the matter, Bogura Sadar OC SM Badiuzzaman said there might be a mistake in accusing one or two people. “We will verify the information.”

Contacted, local BNP lawmaker GM Siraj said filing of the case against so many Chhatra Dal men was “a planned game” of the ruling Awami League.", Bring lawsuit against ,3

The clergy in Arua District has warned Christians against abortions saying it's a common practice done by the people (ladies) in the area.

Delivering his New Year’s message at Christ the King Church in Arua on Wednesday, Rev Fr Mawa Abudala, a priest from Nairobi who led the mass said it's wrong to force somebody to die.

""Let's not force people to die through abortions and murders, people should die naturally. The fetus/baby in your womb is innocent but you take a wrong decision to destroy it which isn't good in the eyes of God,"" he said.

Fr Mawa said this should be one of the resolutions people (ladies) should implement this year. He said it's necessary to have children but people shouldn't destroy them.

""We need a better society that restrains morals. This year should be a year where children are treated well because when schools open, you start complaining that children are finishing your food, budget but we should have good relationship with our children,"" he said.

He added: ""We have very fertile land that could boost production but it's the laziness and idleness of the people that makes such resources unutilised and at the end you complain of poverty. This year, people should go for production so that what has not been achieved last year can be achieved this year.""

33745,7c536855734c3cf4e11b17c19c6218e9,"(JTA) — This is the first op-ed in a series of pieces about anti-Semitism and Jewish issues written by 2020 presidential candidates. This one is by Joe Biden, 77, the former Vice President of the United States.

The Jewish Telegraphic Agency has sent five questions on the topic to all of the registered candidates from both parties. You can read Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s responses here, Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s responses here, and Senator Elizabeth Warren’s responses here.

1. Anti-Semitic hate crimes are currently on the rise across the United States. In 2018, there were two deadly shootings at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, violent attacks now regularly plague the Jews of New York City and Jews continue to be the target of most religion-based hate crimes across the country. What is your plan to address the rise in anti-Semitism across the U.S.?

We have a serious problem with rising tides of white supremacy and anti-Semitism — both in America, on the political right and left, and around the world. It’s not a new phenomenon, but it is the responsibility of leaders everywhere to work aggressively to combat this poison. Instead, we have a president who, in clear language and in code, encourages and emboldens it.

After Charlottesville, Donald Trump gave renewed license and safe harbor for hate to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK. There’s a short line from those people marching with tiki torches in Charlottesville chanting “Jews will not replace us” to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying Jews “were committing genocide to his people.”

We need a comprehensive approach to battling anti-Semitism that takes seriously both the violence that accompanies it and the hateful and dangerous lies that undergird it. Sadly, anti-Semitism takes many different forms and cuts across ideology, political party, group and nation. So we must remain vigilant and speak out every time we see the persistent evil of anti-Semitism rear its ugly head. It’s incumbent on all of us to stand against those who traffic in pernicious stereotypes, or who seek to scare and divide us for political gain. Silence is complicity, so we must speak out — every time. We must call hate by its proper name, and condemn it.

We must also address the extremist, white supremacist violence that has sparked so much bloodshed, especially with Trump fanning the flames of hatred and hollowing out resources we put in place during the Obama-Biden administration to address domestic extremism. I’ll restore that funding and work to pass a federal domestic terrorism law. We can craft legislation that respects free speech and civil liberties, while making the same commitment as a nation to root out domestic terrorism as we have to stopping international terrorism. We must appoint leadership at the U.S. Department of Justice who will prioritize the prosecution of hate crimes — making clear that there is no place for such vitriol in this country.

And we must break the nexus between extremism and gun violence by enacting sensible gun control laws. As president, I’ll make sure assault weapons and high capacity magazines are banned again, and we’ll put in place a buy-back program to get as many of these weapons of war as possible off our streets.

Finally, we know that this hate didn’t begin with Donald Trump and it won’t end when he leaves office. American history is not a fairytale. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull between the American ideal that we are all created equal — and the harsh reality that racism and anti-Semitism have long torn us apart. So we must renew our commitment to our highest ideals and do what this president cannot — stand together against hate; stand up for what, at our best, this nation believes.

2. A number of Democratic lawmakers have recently critiqued Israel in ways that some have characterized as anti-Semitic. What is the line between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism to you?

No nation, including Israel, is immune from legitimate criticism. For example, I have for decades opposed the expansion of settlement activity as counterproductive to peace and damaging to U.S. support for Israel, and I have shared those criticisms directly with Israeli leadership, from Menachem Begin to Bibi Netanyahu. But Israel should never be unfairly singled out or targeted. It’s dangerous. And any action designed to marginalize one ethnic or religious group imperils us all — that’s something the Jewish people know all too well.

That’s why it’s critical to stand against biased resolutions and attempts to delegitimize Israel at the United Nations, and why it’s important to ensure Israel, like other nations, is represented on important committees there.

And it’s why I’ve been clear: the calls here in the United States to boycott, divest from, and sanction Israel are wrong. Period. The BDS movement singles out Israel — home to millions of Jews — in a way that is inconsistent with the treatment of other nations, and it too often veers into anti-Semitism, while letting Palestinians off the hook for their choices.

3. Countless politicians have tried to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and yet, a two-state outcome now seems more dream than possibility. What are your concrete plans to address the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians?

I believe a two-state solution is the only path to long-term security for Israel, while sustaining its identity as a Jewish and democratic state. It is also the only way to ensure Palestinian dignity and their legitimate interest in national self-determination. And it is a necessary condition to take full advantage of the opening that exists for greater cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

At present, neither the Israeli nor Palestinian leadership seems willing to take the political risks necessary to make progress through direct negotiations. This challenge has been made even more difficult by President Trump’s unilateralism, his moves to cut off assistance to the Palestinians and his equivocation on the importance of a two-state solution.

I will restore credible engagement with both sides to the conflict. America must sustain its ironclad commitment to Israel’s security – including the unprecedented support provided by the Obama-Biden administration. It is also essential to resume assistance to the Palestinian Authority that supports Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, people-to-people programs, economic development, and humanitarian aid and health care for the Palestinian people.

My administration will urge both sides to take steps to keep the prospect of a two-state outcome alive. Palestinian leaders should end any incitement and glorification of violence, and they must level with their people about the legitimacy and permanence of Israel as a Jewish state in the historic homeland of the Jewish people. Israeli leaders should stop the expansion of West Bank settlements and talk of annexation that would make two states impossible to achieve. They must recognize the legitimacy of Palestinians’ aspirations for statehood. Both sides should work to provide more relief to the people of Gaza while working to weaken, and ultimately replace, Hamas. And Arab states should take more steps toward normalization with Israel and increase their financial and diplomatic support for building Palestinian institutions.

4. Is there any part of American Jewish culture, or Jewish figure from history, that has been particularly meaningful to you in your life?

I’ve had the honor of meeting every Israeli Prime Minister since Golda Meir and formed close relationships with many of them. In particular, I treasured my deep, personal friendship with Shimon Peres and the wisdom and kindness with which he imbued his leadership. He had an unyielding commitment to the inherent dignity and worth of every single human being, and in my opinion, he embodied the conscience and the soul of Israel. Shimon was always about hope, always about the future.

I met him on my first visit to Israel in 1973 — during my first year in the Senate. That’s also the trip where I met with Meir and her then-aide Yitzhak Rabin for close to an hour. She went through what happened during the Six-Day War, the price that was paid, and painted a bleak picture that, quite frankly, scared me. I had just come from Egypt, and I had seen what was happening there. But when we walked out for the press to take our photo, she said to me: “Senator, don’t worry. We have a secret weapon. You see, we have nowhere else to go.” Just about a month later, the Yom Kippur War touched off.

That experience was foundational for me. It made me understand, in my gut, the threat that the Israeli people live under every day — but also their resilience. Peres and Meir showed me the spirit of a people who, against all odds, transformed the desert, founded a robust democracy and built a thriving economy based on innovation. It’s why I am and have always been such a strong supporter of Israel.

5. Have you participated in a Passover seder or other Jewish holiday ritual? If so, what were the circumstances, and what was the experience like for you?

I’ve had the honor of sharing many meaningful experiences with Jewish friends and family — celebrating weddings, sitting shiva. During our first year in office, in 2009, President Obama became the first president to host a seder at the White House — a tradition he maintained each year of his presidency. In 2013, Jill and I were proud to have the first Vice Presidential Sukkah at the Naval Observatory, and we welcomed Jewish children from the community to come decorate it. It was incredibly meaningful to be able to host our friends from the community during Sukkot with traditional hospitality. And in 2014, I presided over the lighting of the National Menorah to mark the start of Hanukkah with a message that is critical for us all to remember today: “Jewish heritage is American heritage.”

33759,6574475e5e95a387ead7dbefca1d2f11,"Residents of Wajir County have resorted to desperate measures to deal with the locust invasion in the area as they await the government’s intervention.

Police officers were Thursday seen firing bullets in the air to scare away the swarms of locusts that are threatening to wipe out all vegetation in the area.

At the same time, local residents were captured shouting, clapping, whistling and striking metal objects hoping the destructive pests will fly away.

Meanwhile, in Mandera County the government has deployed one helicopter to sprinkle insecticides in a bid to rid the area of the locusts that continue to leave a trail of destruction.

The helicopter is expected in Wajir next week with the most affected areas being Griftu, Gurar and Tarbaj.

According to officials in Wajir, the locusts moved around for close to two hours before settling 8 to 10 kilometers away from Kutulo town.

On December 18, the Food and Agriculture Organisation had warned that locusts would invade countries within the Horn of Africa.

A statement on their website further cautioned that the situation could worsen if not controlled by national authorities.

The locust invasion was first reported in Somalia, which then spread to Northern Kenya.

FAO has warned that the locusts could increase towards the end of January.

The purported attack according to the police was baseless and a figment of the writers’ imagination.

In a telephone interview with Tribune Online on Thursday the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Yakubu Sabo, debunked the rumour of the attack.

“When I contacted the management of the Railway Station, I was told that such rumour was baseless,” he added.

Earlier, the news of the attack was reported by a national daily (not the Tribune).

According to the report, “armed men suspected to be kidnappers Thursday morning attacked an Abuja-bound train with guns.

According to the report, the train had left the Rigassa train station at around 10:00 a.m. and was attacked a few kilometres to Katari, about seventy kilometres to Abuja.

33787,54ccb2a540dd9101fe3677b2bdb0db4b,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned as cowardly, what it saw as the unwarranted and vindictive demolition of a property belonging to former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Kwara State government.

In a statement issued in Abuja on Thursday by Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary, the party described the invasion and demolition as “wicked, cowardly and a direct recipe for huge crisis in the state.”

It held that it was clear that the action of the state government was borne out of hatred and political intolerance, “in furtherance of the larger plot by the APC and its administration to intimidate, suppress, hound, crush and silence opposition and dissenting voices in our country, in the bid to foist a siege mentality on the citizenry.”

The PDP dismissed the reasons given by the APC administration for “this New Year dastardly act as baseless, false and incongruous, as they fail to add up, to justify the ferocious invasion, harassment of citizens and demolition of the said property.”

The party added: “The demolition is a complete subversion of rule of law as the matter is already in court. The APC-led Kwara state government could not wait for the outcome of the court process apparently because it knows that it is pursuing an illegal agenda.

“Nigerians know how the APC and its government have been hounding, harassing and dragging Senator Saraki around over trumped-up charges, for daring to be among compatriots at the forefront of the quest to rescue our nation from misrule and strangleholds of the APC and its cabal.

“The APC and Kwara State government should perish their idea of trying to use false claims and propaganda to justify their wicked act and take over the property, as such cannot hoodwink Nigerians from the truth.

“Moreover, the timing of the invasion and demolition, in the wee hours and under the cover of darkness, is a direct indication that the state government was carrying out an unwholesome and condemnable operation during which defenceless women were fired with gunshots.”

The PDP urged Nigerians to note that demolition of property, genuinely belonging to opposition leaders and other Nigerians perceived to be opposed to APC’s oppressive administration, has become a policy of the APC and its government in their bid to subjugate Nigerians and exclusively appropriate our common patrimony for their selfish purposes.

The statement further said: “Nigerians have not forgotten how APC leaders, including those at the Presidency, applauded whenever property belonging to perceived political opponents was unjustly and viciously pulled down in APC-controlled states and even in Abuja.”

The PDP, however, cautioned the APC, its administration, and in this particular case, the Kwara State government, against crossing the boundaries and stretching the forbearance of the people, “which is already causing a tension that could trigger serious unrest in our country.”

“It is also instructive to note that in the years the PDP governed Kwara State, there was no case of government demolishing the property of opposition members or supporters under any guise whatsoever,” the statement said

The PDP, therefore, said it stood with Senator Saraki and cautioned the Kwara State government to henceforth steer clear of the property."," Threaten, not specified below",3
33788,31799ef5d993cb58353d500b051d1311,"Former housing secretary Julian Castro on Thursday ended his run for US president that pushed the 2020 field on immigration and swung hard at rivals on the debate stage but never found a foothold to climb from the back of the pack.

“I’m so proud of the campaign we’ve run together. We’ve shaped the conversation on so many important issues in this race, stood up for the most vulnerable people, and given a voice to those who are often forgotten,” Castro said in a video posted online.

“But with only a month until the Iowa caucuses, and given the circumstances of this campaign season, I have determined that it simply isn’t our time,” he added. “So today it’s with a heavy heart and with profound gratitude, that I will suspend my campaign for president. To all who have been inspired by our campaign, especially our young people, keep reaching for your dreams – and keep fighting for what you believe in.”

He concluded with, “Ganaremos un dia!” – which translates to “We will win one day!”

Castro, who launched his campaign in January, dropped out after failing to garner enough support in the polls or donations to qualify for recent Democratic debates. A former San Antonio mayor who was the only Latino in the race, Castro had stalled for most of his campaign around 1 percent in polls and entered October low on money.

Castro, 45, was among the youngest in the running at a moment when the party’s ascendant left wing is demanding generational change. As the grandson of a Mexican immigrant, Castro said he recognised the meaning of his candidacy in the face of President Donald Trump’s inflammatory anti-immigrant rhetoric and hardline policies on the US-Mexico border.

It’s with profound gratitude to all of our supporters that I suspend my campaign for president today.

I’m so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together. I’m going to keep fighting for an America where everyone counts—I hope you’ll join me in that fight.

But he laboured not to be pigeonholed as a single-issue candidate. Castro made the attention-getting choice of Puerto Rico as his first campaign stop, recited the names of black victims killed in high-profile police shootings and was the first in the field to call for Trump’s impeachment.

But his sagging poll numbers never budged. He was often eclipsed by another Texan in the race who dropped out late last year, former Representative Beto O’Rourke, and another young former mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend. Castro’s campaign and supporters, meanwhile, grumbled that he did not get due credit for taking out-front positions.

Trying to show he could go toe-to-toe with Trump, Castro swung for big moments on debate stages and flirted with a much-needed breakout in June after confronting O’Rourke over not supporting the decriminalisation those who cross the border between official points of entry.

But turning his sights on Biden on a later stage brought a swift backlash. During the September debate in Houston, Castro appeared to touch on concerns about the age of the then-76-year-old former vice president and added a parting shot at him.

“I’m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you’re not,” Castro said.

Castro – who was Obama’s housing secretary in his second term – denied taking a personal dig at Biden as others in the field condemned the exchange. Three days later, Castro lost one of his three backers in Congress, Representative Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, who switched his endorsement to Biden.

Castro was pegged as a rising Democratic star after being elected as mayor of the nation’s seventh-largest city at age 34, and he was on the short list for Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016. But he swatted away suggestions on the campaign trail this time around that he was auditioning for that role again.

An Amazon spokesperson said employees are “encouraged to work within their teams” and can suggest “improvements to how we operate through those internal channels.”

A group of Amazon employees say the company has threatened to fire them for speaking out against the company’s environmental policies.

In a statement posted to Twitter on Thursday, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice said that several employees were contacted by legal and HR representatives, who said they were in violation of the company’s external communications policy.

Maren Costa, a user experience designer, was one of the employees Amazon threatened to fire. In the statement, Costa said: “This is not the time to shoot the messengers. This is not the time to silence those who are speaking out.”

We must be able to speak up. Here is our press response to Amazon’s intimidation tactics. 3/ pic.twitter.com/7DqhCw09Yf — Amazon Employees For Climate Justice (@AMZNforClimate) January 2, 2020

Two employees were told their roles would be terminated if they continued to speak out about Amazon’s business, a spokesperson for the group told CNBC.

Amazon also threatened to terminate Jamie Kowalski, a software development engineer, according to The Washington Post, which first reported the news on Thursday. Kowalski and Costa said they received letters from one of Amazon’s lawyers after speaking out publicly in October, the Post reported.

In the statement, the employee group claimed that Amazon changed its policy in September, claiming that the updated policy “requires employees to seek prior approval to speak about Amazon in any public forum while identified as an employee.”

However, Jaci Anderson, an Amazon spokesperson, said the company’s communications policy isn’t new. In September, Amazon actually tried to make it easier for employees to speak out by adding a form on an internal web site where employees could seek approval; prior to that, they had to get direct approval from a senior vice president. She added that employees are “encouraged to work within their teams” and can suggest “improvements to how we operate through those internal channels.”

Amazon employees have increasingly pressured the company to address its environmental impact. At Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting in May, thousands of employees submitted a proposal asking Bezos to develop a comprehensive climate-change plan and reduce its carbon footprint, though it was ultimately rejected. The proposal was built on an employee letter published in April that accused Amazon of donating to climate-delaying legislators and urged the company to transition away from fossil fuels.

In September, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company aims to rely on renewable energy entirely by 2030 and have net zero carbon emissions by 2040. The plans were largely viewed as a response to employees’ demands.

33961,d1a032a3a06e07f1929a84aaa0dd0246,"MEXICO CITY - Another inmate was killed Thursday at a prison in northern Mexico where 16 inmates died during a riot on New Year’s Eve.

Security officials in Zacatecas state said four other prisoners were injured in the latest riot at the Cieneguillas prison, where 16 prisoners died on Tuesday.

The Public Safety Department said the prison had been brought back under control. Zacatecas state security secretary Ismael Camberos Hernández told the Milenio television station that inmates angry over the Tuesday riot had attacked prisoners they accused of betraying them that day.

He said the prisoner had been battered to death by fellow prisoners who detached a metal cell door and bashed him with it. The four wounded Thursday also suffered injuries from blows.

But in Tuesday’s riot, authorities confiscated four guns that they believe were smuggled in during visiting hours. Prison guards were placed under investigation after the riot.

Not all of the victims in Tuesday’s riot died from gunshot wounds. Some were stabbed and others beaten with objects. No guards or police were wounded.

Local media reported the prison held members of various gangs and cartels, including the Sinaloa cartel and the Gulf and Northeast cartels.

Such killings frequently involve score settling between rival cartel members or a battle for control of the prison’s illicit business.

Mexico has a long history of deadly prison clashes. In October, six inmates were killed in a prison in Morelos state.

In September, Nuevo Leon state closed the infamous Topo Chico prison, the site of many murders over the years. In February 2016, 49 prisoners died there during rioting when two factions of the Zetas cartel clashed."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
34009,1a3eff76f73db9633a6fe5a6f1c6d19c,"U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attend a NATO summit in Watford, England on December 4, 2019 | Pool photo by Peter Nicholls/AFP via Getty Images Trump warns Turkey’s Erdoğan against military intervention in Libya Rival factions in Libya have split the international community.

President Donald Trump on Thursday warned his Turkish counterpart against sending troops to fight in Libya hours after the Turkish parliament voted to authorize such a move.

Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan discussed several “bilateral and regional issues,” according to a readout of the call released by the White House, as well as simmering tensions and ongoing instability in Libya that have been condemned by the top United Nations official there.

In Libya, where a rival regime in the nation's east has mounted a coup attempt to oust the Tripoli-based government of Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, Trump “pointed out that foreign interference is complicating the situation in Libya,” according to the White House.

The offensive has split the international community: The rival regime led by commander General Khalifa Hifter has been backed the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia, according to The Associated Press, while Sarraj’s government receives aid from Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

Erdoğan and Sarraj recently signed a deal allowing Ankara to send military experts and personnel to the volatile region, the AP reported, and some in Turkey have argued that threats to the Libyan government could ""spread instability to Turkey.""

Erdoğan and Trump also discussed ongoing violence in Syria’s Idlib province along the Turkish border, where Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad’s forces have sought to retake one of the last rebel strongholds in the country. The weekslong offensive has sent hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing north toward Turkey, prompting Trump to issue a vague warning to Assad via Twitter last week.

“The leaders agreed on the need for de-escalation in Idlib, Syria, in order to protect civilians,” the White House readout of Trump and Erdoğan's call said.

The White House statement made no mention of whether the presidents discussed Turkey's campaign against U.S.-allied Kurds in northern Syria, which Trump paved the way for by withdrawing U.S. troops from the region this fall. The U.S. president later condemned the Turkish operation."," Threaten, not specified below",3
34025,e2a4111151fed611c58eb6cd4d3a48a3,"The Trump administration will ban some flavored e-cigarettes from the market in a month in response to growing teenage use of the products.

The ban, announced Thursday, excludes tobacco and menthol flavors, as well as ""open tank"" products that are sold in vape shops and that are used more frequently by adults than by teenagers. The Trump administration said in September that it would impose a far more aggressive restriction, but officials retreated due to concerns about shuttering small businesses and data showing an all-out ban would hurt Trump's reelection chances.

""We have to protect our families,"" President Trump said ahead of a New Year's Eve celebration in Palm Beach, Florida. ""At the same time, it’s a big industry. We want to protect the industry.""

Public health groups have long pushed for the government to crack down on e-cigarettes, which they say entice children through marketing fruity and candy-like flavors. More than 5 million U.S. middle and high school students report they have used e-cigarettes at least once in the past month, and roughly 1 million are using the products every day, according to government data.

Vaping has become prevalent among high and middle schoolers, even though it is illegal for most teenagers. The government funding bill Trump signed into law raised the legal age to buy tobacco, including e-cigarettes, from 18 to 21, beginning immediately in 2020.

The ""open tank"" products spared by the rule allow people to mix their own flavors, while the products affected by the rule are prefilled cartridges. The administration previously said it would ban menthol flavors, but has retreated from that plan, though it will still ban mint.

""I can't see this as a win because the closed cartridge ban will cause more smoking, but open system vapers should be happy tonight,"" Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said on Twitter.

The Department of Health and Human Services isn't characterizing the rules as a ""ban."" To come back on the market, the flavored products will need to be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration. The agency will look at whether flavors can help adults quit smoking and whether they would encourage nonsmokers to start vaping.

Despite the announcement, e-cigarette companies still face a court-ordered May 2020 deadline to submit their products for review. E-cigarette companies say that the review process is far more burdensome on small vaping companies, who are up against massive, traditional cigarette manufacturers who are trying to break into the vaping market.

They have warned that the only company that stands to gain from leaving menthol on the market is Juul Labs, which counts cigarette giant Altria among its investors. Juuls look like USB drives and are very popular among young people, and the company is already compliant with the new rules because it recently stopped selling other flavors besides tobacco and menthol.

For the roughly 10 years e-cigarettes have been available, there has been tension between keeping the devices from teenagers and also making them available to adults who want to quit smoking. Government officials have feared that overly aggressive regulation could lead people to turn back to traditional cigarettes, which are linked to the deaths of 480,000 people a year.

HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a phone call with reporters Thursday that Trump understood vaping was a ""highly complex issue that requires a balanced approach."" He called the regulations a ""smart, targeted policy that protects our kids without causing unnecessary disruption.""

Trump referred to the FDA review process when addressing the issue this week, though he also tied the issue to the separate problem of the serious lung illness outbreak that has killed 55 people and hospitalized 2,561.

""People have died from this. They’ve died from vaping,"" he said. ""We think we understand why. But we’re doing a very exhaustive examination, and hopefully, everything will be back on the market very, very shortly.""

Evidence suggests, however, that the serious lung illness is most likely linked to vaping THC, the high-inducing chemical in marijuana. Specifically, the culprit for the illness appears to be vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent. As officials have weighed regulations, they have had to consider whether their plans could send more people to the black market, worsening the spread of the deadly illness or failing to address it all together.

[Read more: E-cigarette users warn Trump that the real culprit is THC vaping]

In the call with reporters Thursday, Azar stressed it was important to distinguish the two vaping problems. The regulations that came out were meant to address the youth vaping epidemic. Scientists are still trying to figure out what exactly is causing the lung illnesses, and Mitch Zeller, who oversees tobacco regulation for the FDA, told reporters that they might learn several factors in vaping devices, from the oils to their hardware, may have contributed to the problem.

The compromise announced Thursday received criticism from public health groups, who want the Trump administration to regulate e-cigarettes far more strictly. Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, accused the Trump administration of breaking its promise and warned that teenagers would start vaping menthol.

""By leaving menthol-flavored e-cigarettes widely available and completely exempting liquid flavored products, this policy will not stop the youth e-cigarette epidemic,"" Myers said. ""It is a capitulation to both Juul and vape shops and gives a green light to the e-cigarette industry to continue to target and addict kids with flavored products.""

New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, slammed the Trump administration's decision in a statement.

""A public health epidemic of this magnitude requires bold, decisive action,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, the Trump administration caved to industry lobbying pressure and decided to prioritize politics over people’s health.""

In the call with reporters Thursday, officials promised to monitor changes in e-cigarette use — particularly to see whether teenagers switch to menthol — and to make other changes if necessary. Azar said the administration had modified its initial position after seeing data that showed teenagers vaped mint but rarely used menthol, and that teenagers also rarely used the open-tank devices."," Threaten, not specified below",3
34035,cc2872cce768d073a4dad4e334487975,"In a desert far from any city, farmers use groundwater to grow lush, green hay. The hay then goes to fatten livestock all over the world. But there’s a big problem — the water is drying up. And scientists warn it will take thousands of years for the aquifer in Harney County to recover.

At Marjorie and John Thelen’s house, the well ran dry in 2015. “We’re not ranchers; we’re not growing hay. We’re just retired in the country,” said 72-year-old Marjorie Thelen, who moved to southeastern Oregon with her husband 12 years ago.

Impressed by the mountain views and rambling sagebrush, they bought a modest house near Burns. Then, hay farming boomed around them.

“It was like a goldrush,” said John Thelen, 78, describing how giant steel sprinklers cropped up after the state warned of water scarcity in 2016.

Emily Cureton/OPB

He dreads the growing season: “It’s like having your arteries cut open and watching the blood run out, when your water is being sprayed to the wind and it’s evaporating away at humongous quantities.”

Like most people in this dry valley, the couple’s drinking water comes out of the ground. When their well failed, they paid thousands out of pocket to drill deeper, only to find water with high levels of arsenic. Now, their kitchen is cluttered with plastic bottles. A cup of tea starts with a filtration system.

The Thelens say enough is enough: It’s time to stop irrigating in the desert.

In situations of scarcity, the Oregon Water Resources Department has the power to shut off water on the basis of seniority, a centuries-old system farmers say will plunge the region into a depression.

For years, OWRD enabled excessive pumping in the basin, permitting new wells long after it had data showing groundwater depletion. Now that alarm bells are ringing, the agency is advancing a voluntary approach to conservation.

Harney County commissioner and hay farmer Mark Owens said gradual conservation measures, not a sudden shut off, are critical for the region’s economic survival. He argued that if farms go out of business, it would devastate the tax base, crippling schools, roads, libraries and law enforcement. Besides that, he said, hay fields aren’t the final destination for the water.

Emily Cureton/OPB

“I use a lot of water, but the crops that I raise go to Tillamook to produce the milk in the ice cream that you eat, or the grains to feed the beef that you eat,” Owens said.

A Republican running for Oregon House District 60, Owens supports cutting back water use by a few percent every year and subsidizing farms that retire land from irrigation.

“This issue that’s happening in [the] Harney basin is going to happen in a community next to you. If it’s not, just wait,” he said. “We have to protect agriculture because the end user of the water is all of us.”

Over the last few years Owens has gotten to know a group of scientists studying the Harney basin. Before these conversations, he said, “I honestly thought that we were getting groundwater from thousands of miles away.”

That’s not the case.

The Oregon Water Resources Department and the U.S. Geological Survey recently warned the aquifer is out of balance.

Irrigation accounts for roughly 97% of the region’s groundwater use, and these powerful wells drain isolated pockets of water much faster than they refill. Groundwater pumped out in just a few decades took thousands of years to accumulate. Pressure from the wells has changed the gradient in some places, making it impossible for water to come back. And because of the region’s volcanic geology, rain and snowmelt don’t penetrate deeply in some areas, at least not on the scale of human societies.

Historically, policymakers in the West divvied up groundwater like it was coming from a giant subterranean ocean that would never run dry.

“I’ll give you an example. In 1904, a Texas Supreme Court ruling found that groundwater was so secret, occult and concealed that it was too difficult to legally control it,” explained Todd Jarvis, director of the Institute for Water and Watersheds at Oregon State University.

More than a hundred years later, this mindset is just starting to change. Texas now has groundwater conservation districts. Utah allows pooling water rights to create proportional shares, rather than privileging the oldest claims first. California recently became the first state to pass a law requiring sustainable groundwater management.

And at an Oregon dinner table with Swedish meatballs and creamed corn, people in conflict are working toward the state’s first-ever voluntary conservation agreement.

“I want to thank you for the food,” Oregon Water Resources Department Director Tom Byler said to a roomful of Harney County residents in December.

“There are a lot of hard conversations ahead, but watching this group in action gives me a lot of hope.”

Emily Cureton/OPB

A voluntary water conservation agreement has never succeeded in Oregon before. An attempt in the water-challenged Wallowa basin failed. For Brenda Smith of the High Desert Partnership, a successful collaboration is all about relationships.

“It’s a thousand cups of coffee,” said Smith, whose nonprofit mediates natural resource conflicts in eastern Oregon.

She admits building consensus is slow work. “But if you’re going to fight about it, we don’t have that time either,” she said.

Smith said she thinks after decades of conflict over the creation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, people got tired of fighting. They worked together to agree on a collaborative management plan there, which became a national model for balancing grazing interests with wildlife and wetlands. The plan built relationships between ranchers and federal land managers. In 2016, those connections took steam out of an armed occupation at the refuge. Militia leaders from outside the area hoped local ranchers would take up arms against the federal government, but that didn’t happen.

Now, the region’s very survival is on the line: drinking water, the economy and the environment. People in Harney County have been having meals and collaborative meetings for years to address the impending crisis. At a recent meeting, they formed a circle, where hay farmers like Owens, who want to change slowly, sat across from homeowners like the Thelens, who want decisive action now.

They’ve agreed, the goal is to find common ground, before it’s too late.

34115,e43d0c0d45bbead9cdf54f3689ce1554,"Most federal agencies continue to improve the cyber threat data they share but several barriers remain, according to a joint report submitted to Congress in December.

The report was compiled by the inspectors general of seven agencies legally responsible for executing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, which created a framework for the voluntary sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive measures between federal agencies and the private sector. The CISA Act applies to the departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice and Treasury, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and requires IGs from those agencies to compile Congressional reports on the law’s implementation every two years.

“The OIGs determined that sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive measures has improved over the past two years and efforts are underway to expand accessibility to information. Sharing cyber threat indicators and defensive measures increases the amount of information available for defending systems and networks against cyber attacks,” the report said.

However, auditors dinged five Defense Department components for using insufficient policies and procedures when “sharing, receiving, or disseminating cyber threat information.” Auditors faulted the Defense Department components for opting to use agency-specific policies and procedures that were “not sufficient” because they do not meet the CISA Act’s statute for safeguarding and removing personally identifiable information or “notifying entities when information received under the statute does not constitute a cyber threat.”

While the CISA Act mandates the creation of a framework to share threat information, it doesn’t mandate all agencies or nongovernment entities use it. According to the report, one of the chief barriers hindering better threat sharing is the lack of participation from industry, with “minimal” nongovernment entities using the government’s Automated Indicator Sharing tool.

“As of December 2018, 252 federal and non-federal entities and 13 international computer emergency response teams were connected to receive cyber threat information from AIS. However, DHS has only experienced a slight increase in the number of data producers sharing cyber threat indicators and defensive measures using AIS and, as of June 2019, only four Federal and six non-Federal entities used AIS to share cyber threat information,” according to the report. Homeland Security sees the limited participation as its main barrier to improving the quality of the data.

Other barriers the info sharing program face include classification issues that keep some threat information from being widely shared; the inability of machines to communicate with each other, reducing the speed at which threat sharing occurs; uncertainty about the protection from liability provided by the statute and challenges with the AIS tool that deter its use."," Threaten, not specified below",3

WASHINGTON — A meeting Thursday of the DC Council's Committee on Judiciary could potentially be the start of making legislation that will be geared towards fighting youth e-cigarette use in Washington.

The morning meeting saw a variety of community members and organizations speak on how e-cigarettes have impacted youth and why they believe an ordinance should be placed to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes.

No vote will likely be made Thursday, as the committee meeting is being used to gather information and hear from a variety of people in the community. But there are possibilities that are being thought of on legislation that could be implemented.

Part of what the Council could look at doing is requiring a prescription to buy any electronic smoking device and prohibit the sale of e-cigs within a quarter-mile of a middle or high school.

2019 was a year that vaping and e-cigarette use fell under attack by many in communities around the country after deaths were connected to the use of some products.

In October, the CDC reported the first vaping-associated death in DC and has confirmed over 1,600 deaths nationally related to vaping.

""DC Health urges District residents to refrain from using all e-cigarette and vaping products until further notice,"" a DC Health press release said in October. ""Cannabis or THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) vape-products that are obtained off the street may pose the greatest risk.""

They determined to “Turkify” the land, cleanse it ethnically of the Christian minorities, and erase, to the extent possible, all traces of their existence. Among the myths created at the time of the founding of the Turkish Republic in 1923, was the tale that the Armenians had not inhabited those lands; they had “always been Turkish.”

In 2011, I had the opportunity to travel with my brother and my husband to Turkey, as part of a group of Armenians from America. Our guide was the indefatigable Armen Aroyan of California, who has accompanied groups of “pilgrims” to the lands of historic Western Armenia for over a quarter century. We were hoping to rediscover the villages where our parents had lived, in the Arapkir province, and were fortunate enough to find them. But signs of Armenian life were nowhere to be found. In other cities and towns we visited, like Kars, we found the remains of Armenian churches turned into mosques; in other localities they had become museums, still others, stables where animals lived.

Yet, the evidence of Armenian life and culture could not be totally eradicated; the very stones, albeit in ruins, could bear testimony to the story of the people who once lived there, with their homes, their shops and factories, their schools and churches—above all, churches, chapels and monasteries. Ani, the ancient capital of an Armenian kingdom, with its legendary 1001 churches, is the most eloquent example. What was most painful, as I wrote in a report on our visit, was to witness the attempt to eradicate memory itself. (See https://mirrorspectator.com/2011/07/29/opinion-the-stones-will-cry-out/)

Now Germans have the opportunity to make a similar journey through parts of historic Armenia, albeit not in person, but through images and words. On December 5, an exhibition opened in Osnabrück, which documents precisely this history. “1915-2015. Armenische Architektur und Genozid” is the title of the exhibition organized by the Erich Maria Remarque-Friedenszentrum (Peace Center) in cooperation with the German-Armenian Society (DAG). The venue of the show is particularly significant. The Erich Maria Remarque Peace Center, founded in 1996 by the city and university of Osnabrück, is dedicated to the life and works of the author best known for his “All Quiet on the Western Front.” The center has an archive open to researchers, and organizes regular activities including exhibitions, lectures, film showings and symposia. Among them have been two events on Armin T. Wegner. For Dr. Raffi Kantian, president of the DAG, it is especially appropriate to hold the exhibition at this center; he stressed that whereas Remarque in his world famous book, “described the horrors of World War I on the Western front,” the exhibition presents the “consequences of the extermination of the Armenians on the Eastern front.”

Writing on his personal blog, Mr Cummings sets out plans for a Downing Street shake-up in which maths and physics PhDs would mingle with 'weirdos and misfits with odd skills' and people who 'fought their way out of appalling hell holes'.

Mr Cummings warns recruits that he will 'bin you within weeks if you don't fit', adding: 'Don't complain later because I made it clear now.'

The former Vote Leave supremo is also hiring a personal assistant, but warns that the new recruit will have tasks 'which you won't enjoy'.

The advert is a direct challenge to the civil service and Whitehall establishment which Mr Cummings has long criticised and which Mr Johnson plans to reform.

Recruiter: Boris Johnson's top special adviser Dominic Cummings (pictured days after the Tory election victory last month) wants 'super-talented weirdos' to work for him at Number 10

Setting out his plans in a meandering 2,900-word blog post, Mr Cummings warns of 'profound problems at the core of how the British state makes decisions'.

Mr Johnson's 80-seat majority means the Tory government has 'little need to worry about short-term unpopularity while trying to make rapid progress,' he predicts.

The 48-year-old, whose official title is Chief Special Adviser to the Prime Minister, says he wants his new recruits to make him 'much less important' and 'largely redundant' within a year.

'We want to hire an unusual set of people with different skills and backgrounds to work in Downing Street,' he says.

Mr Cummings plans to hire a fleet of maths and physics experts with 'exceptional academic qualifications' to work on AI, data science and communications problems.

He is also looking for 'unusual software developers' and 'unusual economists', citing a string of academic concepts which candidates should know about.

Number 10 is also looking for 'great project managers' who could oversee projects such as Brexit.

'If you think you are one of the a small group of people in the world who are truly GREAT at project management, then we want to talk to you,' Mr Cummings says.

'We need people like this who have a 1 in 10,000 or higher level of skill and temperament.'

Mr Cummings also promises to hire a team of 'junior researchers', some of them university graduates.

The jobs available include a year-long posting as a 'sort of personal assistant' to Mr Cummings.

'This will involve a mix of very interesting work and lots of uninteresting trivia that makes my life easier which you won't enjoy,' he says.

'You will not have weekday date nights, you will sacrifice many weekends — frankly it will hard having a boy/girlfriend at all.

'It will be exhausting but interesting and if you cut it you will be involved in things at the age of ~21 that most people never see.

'I don't want confident public school bluffers. I want people who are much brighter than me who can work in an extreme environment. If you play office politics, you will be discovered and immediately binned.'

Mr Cummings also wants communications and policy experts, criticising the Whitehall practice of employing generalists who frequently move jobs.

'With no election for years and huge changes in the digital world, there is a chance and a need to do things very differently,' he says.

'We also are interested in people who have worked in movies or on advertising campaigns.'

The final category of jobs is 'super-talented weirdos', although Mr Cummings admits he 'doesn't really know what I'm looking for'.

'People in SW1 talk a lot about diversity but they rarely mean true cognitive diversity,' Mr Cummings writes.

'They are usually babbling about 'gender identity diversity blah blah'.

'What SW1 needs is not more drivel about 'identity' and 'diversity' from Oxbridge humanities graduates but more genuine cognitive diversity.

'If you want to figure out what characters around Putin might do, or how international criminal gangs might exploit holes in our border security, you don’t want more Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers and spread fake news about fake news.'

Plans: The advert is a direct challenge to the civil service and Whitehall establishment which Mr Cummings has long criticised and which Boris Johnson (pictured) plans to reform

He goes on: 'We need some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole.

'By definition I don't really know what I'm looking for but I want people around No10 to be on the lookout for such people.

'We need to figure out how to use such people better without asking them to conform to the horrors of 'Human Resources' (which also obviously need a bonfire).'

Mr Cummings will be one of the interviewers himself, he says. Applicants must be able to commit for at least two years.

Prospective candidates are told to send their applications to a Gmail address rather than an official government email account.

In a typically rambling post, he also mentions the Apollo missions, quotes from military strategists and cites academic papers about war and statistics.

Mr Cummings was appointed by Mr Johnson when he became PM in July 2019 and will now wield substantial power following the Tories' emphatic election win.

Mark Serwotka, the head of the civil service union PCS, has already vowed to resist plans for a major overhaul of Whitehall.

'The major problem for the civil service in the last decade has been under investment, real terms pay cuts and poor government policy,' he said.

'Comments by Dominic Cummings that imply he wants to hire and fire at will reveal an anti-trade union mentality and will be strenuously resisted by PCS.'

Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA which represents senior civil servants, has also warned that the PM's allies are exhibiting a 'fundamental misunderstanding' of the modern civil service."," Threaten, not specified below",3

34541,da184d59466a2b1a138cb3fb22bcb4ec,"Vermont Business Magazine Attorney General TJ Donovan in St Albans today announced that his office filed a lawsuit against Pleasant Valley Farms of Berkshire, LLC and its operators Mark St Pierre and Amanda St Pierre for violations of Vermont’s agricultural laws and regulations. The alleged violations stem from actions at the Lumbra Farm in Berkshire, a dairy farm owned by the St Pierres that the state alleges is part of the Pleasant Valley Farms operation.

In the Complaint, the State alleges that, in 2017, Pleasant Valley Farms and the St Pierres expanded an existing barn at the Lumbra Farm without obtaining any necessary permits and approvals and without providing required advanced notice to the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets. The barn is alleged to have increased in size from around 13,000 square feet to approximately 104,000 square feet (roughly 2.4 acres). The barn went from approximately 120 feet long to approximately 825 feet long.

In addition to the unpermitted barn expansion, the State alleges that Pleasant Valley Farms and the St Pierres also built a 10-million-gallon manure pit, capable of accommodating waste for more than 1,500 mature dairy cows, at the Lumbra Farm without required notice or advanced approval.

SEE VPR STORY ON PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION

“We have a long and proud tradition of farming, agriculture, and environmental stewardship in Vermont,” said Attorney General Donovan. “We need to continue to support our farmers while also protecting water quality and the environment by applying these rules across the board.”

In addition to claims relating to the failure to obtain necessary permits and pre-construction approval, the State has alleged violations of Vermont’s Required Agricultural Practices (RAPs) for the farm’s failure to have a nutrient management plan or maintain necessary documents during a 2018 inspection of the Lumbra Farm by the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets. RAPs are standards to which all types of Vermont farms must be managed to assure agricultural pollution does not reach Vermont’s waters.

The State’s seven-count complaint, which was filed in the Vermont Superior Court, Franklin Unit today, seeks an order requiring that Pleasant Valley Farms and the St Pierres, among other things: apply for a Large Farm Operation (LFO) permit for the Lumbra Farm; bring the Lumbra Farm into compliance with all required RAPs and LFO rules; and pay civil penalties as permitted by law.

The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets has worked with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office in all aspects of this enforcement matter.

Khalilzad paused the negotiations with the Taliban in Qatar last month after the Taliban attacked the Bagram airfield north of Kabul that killed at least two people and injured nearly 70 others.

The US has been pressing the Taliban for reduction in violence and reports said Khalilzad has suggested a brief ceasefire before the signing of the peace agreement.

Both sides had finalized draft of the agreement in August at the conclusion of ninth round of talks. However, US President Donald Trump called off the talks in early September after Taliban killed an American soldier and 11 other people in Kabul.

Taliban political spokesman Suhail Shaheeen stated earlier that the Taliban representatives had suggested a break in the talks for consultations with the leaders.

Taliban sources told Daily Times that the Taliban leadership have wrapped up discussions on the US proposal and recommendations were sent to their chief for a final decision. They said majority of the leadership council had favoured the proposal to reduce violence that will pave the way for signing of the peace agreement.

VOA Pashto service quoted an unnamed American diplomat in Kabul as saying the US may not resume formal negotiations unless the Taliban agreed to reduce violence.

“If the Taliban want to resume the talks with the US they should agree to the proposal to reduce violence,” the diplomat was quoted as saying.

He said Taliban have concluded consultations with the senior leadership and Khalilzad will seek answer to his demand.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said this week that the United States had asked for a reduction in the scale and intensity of violence and discussions were held by the Taliban solely around this specific issue.

However, he had dismissed as “false and baseless” reports about a ceasefire by the Taliban and said the Taliban have no intention of declaring a ceasefire.

American negotiators are pushing for the ceasefire as another confidence building measure after the much-publicized prisoner swap deal in November.

As the US calls for reduction in violence Taliban have stepped up attacks on the Afghan forces and several deadly attacks were carried out in recent days in north of Afghanistan.

Taliban fighters killed dozens of security personnel in northern provinces of Takhar, Kunduz, Balkh and Jauzjan, Afghan officials said on Wednesday. Taliban also took control of Darzab district in Jauzjan.

Meanwhile Pakistan on Thursday called for “early and successful conclusion” of the US-Taliban talks to end the conflict in Afghanistan.

Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said Pakistan has played a positive role towards resumption of the peace process in Afghanistan.

“It has been our desire to seek an early and successful conclusion of the peace process and US-Taliban talks, which will lead to intra Afghan dialogue. We continue to support and facilitate the process,” Farooqui said at weekly briefing in Islamabad.

She said Pakistan’s positive role and contribution in the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan has been widely appreciated and acknowledged."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

Sam Butler, a senior member of Warwickshire Hunt said the claim made by West Midlands Hunt Saboteurs that a hound had been killed by a train was “untrue.”

“I rang the kennels and no hound was injured and no hound was killed. Thirty-three hounds went out and thirty-three returned to the kennels safe and uninjured,” Mr Butler said.

34602,a388cda296a0fb492e19f014c21c2be3,"Tullow Oil shares plunged on Thursday after the troubled exploration company found less oil than expected after drilling an offshore well in Guyana.

Irish-founded Tullow reported that results from test drilling of its Carapa-1 well off Guyana’s coast showed the oil deposit was smaller than it had hoped, while analysts said that the find was not commercial.

The news wiped more than £60 million sterling (€70 million) off Tullow’s value. The group’s shares tumbled 20 per cent in early trade in London, where it has its main listing, though it recovered to close 6.78 per cent down on the day at 59.66 pence sterling.

Mark MacFarlane, Tullow’s chief operating officer, conceded that the results were below the company’s pre-drill estimates, but he said they proved that an existing lucrative find in Guyanese waters extended to areas covered by its licences.

Job Langbroek, analyst at Davy stockbrokers, noted the reservoir thickness was “sub-optimal and not commercial”. David Round of BMO Capital Market said that the outcome was “some way short” of investors’ expectations ahead of the result.

The poorer than anticipated finding from Carapa-1 follows news that oil production from Tullow’s key fields off Ghana’s coast in west Africa would fall below forecast levels this year.

Chief executive Paul McDade and exploration director Angus McCoss quit last month after Tullow cut production forecasts for a third time. Its shares fell almost 70 per cent in 2019.

Tullow also warned in November that two other discoveries in Guyana contained heavy oil, prompting fears that the projects would be difficult to commercialise.

Liabilities

BMO Capital Markets noted that Carapa-1 had been seen as the “big Hail Mary play” to save the Tullow story after it downgraded its predictions for Ghana.

Tullow said that the well’s net pay – the thickness of the actual oil deposit – was four metres. The company will plug and abandon the well. It will carry out a detailed laboratory of analysis of the oil found, which it said was of reasonable quality.

The Carapa-1 well falls within the Kanuku block off the coast of Guyana in South America, which is 37.5 per cent owned by Tullow. A further 37.5 per cent stake is held by the operator, Spain’s Repsol, and France’s Total owns the remaining 25 per cent.

Tullow suspended its dividend in December and pledged to take steps to cut its liabilities. The company expected net debt to be $2.82 billion by the end of 2019.

Tullow expects total oil production this year to be between 70,000 and 80,000 barrels a day, down from original forecasts of 87,000.

It estimates that production for the next three years would average 70,000 barrels a day from an original prediction of 100,000. – Additional reporting The Financial Times Limited 2020"," Threaten, not specified below",3

The investiture vote is due between Jan. 4 and 7.

The ERC said it would refrain from voting after the Socialists committed to an open dialogue on secessionists' wishes for Catalonia, which would then be submitted to a citizens' vote in the wealthy northern region.

At a news conference, ERC official Pere Aragones also said his party told the leader of Catalonia's regional government it would push for a new independence referendum in conversations with central government.

Spain has struggled to maintain stable governments since 2015 when a slew of smaller parties sprung up in the wake of the financial crisis, leading to four elections in as many years.

To avoid forcing Spaniards to return to the polls, Sanchez has been scrambling to drum up support for a proposed coalition with left-wing party Unidas Podemos.

Sanchez and Podemos´s leader Pablo Iglesias said on Monday that their coalition, if confirmed, would push for tax hikes and a rollback of a labour reform by a previous conservative government.

The most recent election in November left the two parties with a combined 155 seats, short of a majority in Spain's 350-member lower house, and thrusting ERC and its 13 representatives into the role of kingmaker.

Sanchez's Socialist Party confirmed it had reached an agreement with the ERC for a dialogue over Catalonia, but did not mention their potential abstention at the investiture vote.

Spain's constitution prohibits regions from breaking away and the Catalan independence drive in recent years, which included a banned referendum in 2017, has caused the country's worst political furore in decades.

34782,bf52b3a7f1f688fce7813a3ece8de3f6,"VERNAL — A 5-year-old Uintah County boy was hospitalized last month after he was scratched by a neighbor’s pet raccoon, state wildlife officials said Thursday.

The boy suffered significant scratches on Dec. 11 and had to undergo emergency surgery, according to officials with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.

While the agency didn’t release the boy’s name and didn’t have an update on his condition, Tonya Kieffer-Selby, outreach manager for the division, said Thursday he has “a very long road to recovery ahead of him.”

“Our main concern was that this boy was properly taken care of,” she said. “Raccoons are known to be carriers of different parasites, viruses and bacteria; and so when we initially received the call, our main concern was making sure this boy was treated correctly for his injury.”

Kieffer-Selby said the raccoon was euthanized and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be tested for any diseases.

The DWR is using the incident to remind people not to keep wild animals as pets.

“It’s a concern for (wildlife) health, the public’s welfare, public safety, as well as bringing these animals into your home. You can be infecting other animals — pets and other wildlife,” Kieffer-Selby said. “We want (the public) to support wildlife. … Utah’s wildlife is a very big part of its heritage and culture, but we also need to make sure people are going to be doing it legally and safely for everyone.”

According to the agency, raccoons aren’t a protected species in Utah, and people don’t need a license to hunt them. But a permit from the Utah Department of Agriculture is required to own them as pets, Kieffer-Selby said. Other animals in a similar category include coyotes, red foxes and striped skunks.

Owning those species without the proper permit may lead to a class B misdemeanor, according to the division. The animal may also be seized.

In addition to possible erratic behavior, diseases are a major cause for concern. Raccoons, for example, may carry diseases such as rabies, canine distemper, raccoon parvoviral enteritis, infectious canine hepatitis, and pseudorabies. The species can also transmit leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis, which may be lethal for unborn babies, Kieffer-Selby said.

“Some of these things they can be infected with aren’t necessarily killed by washing your hands with soap and water,” she said. “Chemicals don’t always take care of the issue when you bring in a wild animal, and they could be infected with these different bacteria, viruses or parasites.”

Kieffer-Selby said she understands it’s tempting to bring home baby animals found in the wild. However, she said people should use common sense and deal with wildlife safely and legally.

“You may think bringing in an animal like this is safe; it isn’t,” she said.

Correction: In an earlier version, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources said a federal permit is required to keep a racoon as a pet. The permit is actually issued by the Utah Department of Agriculture."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Mesa police report that on Dec. 25, the boy's father removed him and his two younger siblings from their home after seeing his son bruised and bloody.

Police say about 15 minutes prior to the father's arrival, Nicole Smith, 33, asked her 8-year-old son to bring her nail clippers. When she saw that his hands and nails were dirty, she reportedly hit the child on both sides of his face.

The boy's father told police that the boy had a bloody nose and bruised eye. He removed the boy and his younger siblings from the home and contacted police.

Smith reportedly admitted to being drunk but denied hitting the boy, saying it was his younger sister that hit him. Police say several cans of malt liquor were found throughout the home.

Court records show that Smith was convicted of child abuse in a 2010 incident where she reportedly choked, punched, and bit the ear of another son. Court documents show she also threatened him by saying, ""she brought him into the world, and she would take him out.""

Smith was initially sentenced to 10 years probation, but later served two years in prison for violating the conditions of her probation.

Smith has been charged with child abuse.

If you suspect a child is being abused, the Arizona Department of Child Services has resources available to report the issue to a social worker. You can call the Arizona Child Abuse Hotline at 1-888-SOS-CHILD (1-888-767-2445), and will be asked for information about the child, as well as the nature of your concerns.

34987,d5d1e08d4099f4eef51fe495c43170bc,"It was in 2005 that I made an audacious claim...

The transition to a new energy economy had officially begun, the end of coal was upon us, and little by little, renewable energy was going to go from niche experiment to the second largest form of electricity generation in the United States.

You would’ve thought I had burned a flag, spit on the grave of George Washington, and stole a ham sandwich from a homeless teenager.

The reaction to my claim was incredibly hostile. And at the time, I found it odd.

Why would so many people get so angry about a suggestion that simply predicted a transition of our energy economy? It’s not as if such a thing had never happened before.

It’s just how it goes.

Old technologies get pushed out, new ones come in.

If this weren’t the case, you wouldn’t be reading this on a computer screen, and you sure as hell wouldn’t have had it delivered directly to your inbox within seconds of it being published. But man, some people are really loyal to things like coal-fired power and internal combustion — despite their uses becoming somewhat superfluous.

After stewing on this question for a while, however, I realized I was just as guilty of being loyal to one form of electricity generation over another.

For me, it was really about the promise of a cleaner planet as a result of burning less fossil fuels and relying more on “free” energy resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, and the waves and tides of the ocean.

Such a loyalty, however, labeled me everything from tree-hugger to socialist. Not really sure how not wanting to treat the planet like a toilet is part of a socialist agenda, especially since I'm such an unapologetic capitalist, but I digress.

The point is, not only did I see this cleaner energy transition coming, but I was rooting for it. And that, dear reader, was the issue.

I was rooting for something that was new to a lot of people. Something that, until recently, wasn’t particularly viable on a large scale. Something that, for some weird reason, was oftentimes mocked by energy industry gatekeepers and the Wall Street elite.

Of course, I’ve never cared about either of those, nor have I ever been particularly bothered by ruffling the feathers of the status quo. Honestly, I kind of get off on it.

So to start 2020 off right, I’m going to do it again.

Energy Security or Global Threat?

A few days ago, energy company EnBW took its Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant offline after its license expired at the start of the new year.

This is one of seven nuclear power plants that will be retired over the next two years, in coordination with Germany’s decision to phase out its nuclear power generation.

Some nuclear power bulls argue that this phase-out will endanger the country’s energy security — despite the fact that nuclear only accounted for about 13% of the nation’s consumed power last year.

Given that renewable energy delivered more than 47% of consumed electricity from the grid last year, such an argument seems a bit hyperbolic. It could also be argued that while concerns about energy security are not without merit, to deny that nuclear power still comes with its own set of serious threats, as well as massive financial burdens, is irresponsible and dishonest.

We’re Screwed

While the Germans were busy retiring one of their nuclear power plants, Japanese officials charged with the responsibility of monitoring the remains of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant realized they were in a bit of a pickle: They don’t have any more space to store all that radioactive water they’ve been collecting like frantic nebbishes armed with leaky rain barrels.

Japanese officials said they might be forced to dump the contaminated water into the ocean. To put this in perspective, that’s 1.7 million tons of contaminated water heading to the Pacific Ocean.

According to Kim Ik-jung, a member of the Korea Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, it would be far safer to keep that radioactive water in tanks until the radiation level becomes low enough. The downside: That takes a lot of time and a lot of money. And let’s be honest, how safe is it to keep it in tanks for 300 years, anyway?

Not to be crass, but when it comes to safely disposing of this radioactive water, we’re kind of screwed.

Now, in all fairness, this very serious situation is not the result of the splitting of isotopes. It’s the result of a very dangerous combination of lax policies, sub-par safety procedures, poor logistical planning, and human error.

You see, I don’t distrust nuclear physics. It’s people that I don’t trust. Especially those who tend to make the types of decisions that affect public safety. And to understand my skepticism, you needn’t look any further than Chernobyl, Fukushima, or the more than half of the nuclear power plants in the U.S. that have fallen below acceptable safety standards.

Sure, there are plenty of folks who will call me crazy and tell me how safe and important nuclear power is. But I don’t buy it. There are far too many smart people on this planet who can, and have, come up with better alternatives to fossil fuels and nuclear.

This isn’t to discredit the contributions both fossil fuels and nuclear have made. Those can’t be denied. But the typewriter and rotary phone also made huge contributions to society, and we no longer use those because better alternatives were found. The same can be said with the move to safer, cleaner electricity generation.

Bottom line: It’s time.

And not just to embrace the future of electricity generation, but to invest wisely in the companies and industries that are making it all possible.

That’s not to say you still can’t make money in oil, gas, coal, and nuclear. Certainly you can. But the way I see it, it just makes more sense to invest and profit from all the things that will make this planet cleaner and safer for future generations, instead of backing fossil fuels and nuclear, which now seem to be becoming more of a liability and less of an asset, as they really do pose a serious threat to our natural capital: things such as fresh water, clean air, and healthy soil.

Certainly no form of electricity generation is environmentally benign, but some are simply worse than others. And if this makes me sound like an overzealous tree-hugger, then so be it.

But make no mistake: This overzealous tree-hugger has made a lot of people very, very wealthy by following one simple rule: Do well by doing good.

I’ve been doing it for more than a decade, and I’ll continue to do it in 2020.

I hope you’ll join me.

To a new way of life and a new generation of wealth...

The government in Tripoli — backed by Turkey and Qatar — has been under sustained attack since April by military strongman General Khalifa Haftar, who is backed by Ankara’s regional rivals: Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

Erdogan has repeatedly accused Russia of sending private mercenaries to support Haftar’s forces, though Moscow has denied this.

* Over 175 illegal migrants nabbed by Sri Lanka Navy in 2019

Fri, Jan 3, 2020, 12:17 am SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

Jan 02, Colombo: With a sharp increase in Sri Lankan illegal migrants to Australia and New Zealand in 2019, Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) has strengthened its surveillance operations with the support of the Sri Lanka Air force (SLAF) and the Australia's Operations Sovereign Borders (AOSB).

The Navy Spokesman said Lieutenant Commander Isuru Sooriyabandara said on average 64 Sri Lankans had tried to flee the country illegally in the years of 2016, 2017 and 2018.

However, 175 illegal migrants had left Sri Lanka in last year alone, the Spokesman revealed during a press briefing held at the Media Centre, today (02 Jan). The illegal migrants were mainly from Chilaw, Batticaloa, Dondra and Trincomalee, he said.

According to Lieutenant Commander Sooriyabandara, some of those who were trying to flee the country were arrested while they were preparing to flee the country and the majority of them was apprehended in the territorial waters by the Navy following Naval intelligence information.

Mentioning the recent arrest of four persons in Trincomalee trying to flee, he said the AOSB Commander Major General Craig Furini had announced during his recent visit to Sri Lanka that both Sri Lankan and the Australian Governments were sharing a strong relationship and continued to work together to thwart people smuggling operations and to prevent people risking their lives at sea.

The Australian official has warned that the illegal migrants will risk their lives for ""zero chance of success"". ""Australia's tough boarder protection policies mean no one who travels illegally by boat will ever be allowed to live or work in Australia,"" he has said.

The Navy Spokesman also mentioned that some people had fallen prey to the intrigues by racketeers engaged in this illegal act. Explaining the risk involved in these sea voyages, he further urged the general public not to lose their hard earned money and property by undertaking such risks while tarnishing the image of the country.

Elaborating further, Lieutenant Commander Sooriyabandara said the naval operations have been increased as never before with the help of capable naval personnel and a strong surveillance system. The Navy would seek the assistance of other security services when necessary, he added."," Threaten, not specified below",3

But if we go to any protest, and there is even a stray incident of violence, blame will be directly put at our door,” Singh said. “We have spoken and voted against the law when it was introduced in Parliament as a Bill. But if we go to any protest, and there is even a stray incident of violence, blame will be directly put at our door,” Singh said.

Lending vocal support to the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh Thursday said that party chief Arvind Kejriwal has steered clear of joining the demonstrations to avoid playing into the BJP’s hands.

Singh, the AAP’s election in-charge in Delhi, said the BJP was unable to convince even its allies such as the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Lok Janshakti Party on the stated objectives of the new citizenship law, which he termed as “unconstitutional” and against the secular ethos of India.

On Kejriwal’s absence from the protests, Singh quoted an Urdu couplet: “Wo qatl bhi karte hain toh charcha nahi hoti, hum aah bhi karte hain ho jaate hain badnam (They are not topics of discussion even when they commit murder, but our names are sullied even if we draw a sigh).”

“We have spoken and voted against the law when it was introduced in Parliament as a Bill. But if we go to any protest, and there is even a stray incident of violence, blame will be directly put at our door. That’s why we have been appealing for peace and urging people to carry out protests in a democratic way. Had Kejriwal gone anywhere to participate in the protests, the BJP would have put the blame for all the violence on him,” Singh told The Indian Express.

Kejriwal has, in the past, said there was no “logic” behind CAA and NRC, at a time when India is witnessing an economic slowdown and unemployment.

Singh said AAP MLAs such as Amanatullah Khan and Hazi Ishraq were making themselves available at the local level.

He said Khan, who represents the Okhla constituency, was needlessly dragged into the Jamia row: “He did not utter a word to incite; he appealed for peace, tried to make way for ambulances (on the day of violence in Jamia). Police has named former Congress MLA Asif Mohammad Khan in the FIR but has not taken action against him. His brother Arif Mohammed Khan was made Kerala Governor by the BJP. The nexus between Congress and BJP in Delhi could not be clearer.”

Asked if AAP agrees with the contention that the CAA was an attempt to create religious polarisation in the country, Singh said the AAP, “unlike the BJP which believes in Nathuram Godse”, was firmly with the principles enshrined in the Constitution.

“When the Constitution says India is a secular country, whoever says India is not is against the Constitution. BJP supports the killer of Gandhi. They have someone like Pragya Thakur as their MP… Is the family of Netaji Subhas Bose patriotic or not, now that his grand nephew, who is the BJP’s Bengal vice-president, has also opposed CAA?” Singh said.

He said both Hindus and Muslims were part of the ongoing protests: “It would not be right to suggest that only elite sections of Hindus are backing it. When these people support BJP, they become patriots; on opposing, they are labelled elites.”

Public company directors, who are under constant threat of claims, received welcome news earlier this month. On December 9, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that corporate directors cannot be sued for whistleblower retaliation under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). The SDNY decision splits with a 2015 opinion from a California federal district court permitting SOX claims against corporate directors to go forward.

The SDNY case involved a number of “yieldco” subsidiaries formed by SunEdison to facilitate investment in renewable energy projects. The plaintiff and alleged whistleblower was the CEO of two of these subsidiaries. The CEO claimed that he started questioning SunEdison’s public statements about the subsidiaries’ finances and SunEdison’s liquidity and that, in response, the subsidiaries terminated his employment. He also accused two SunEdison directors – the Board’s Executive Chairman and Governance Committee chair – of orchestrating his termination. The CEO’s claim was consolidated with related shareholder litigation concerning the representations about SunEdison’s finances.

The court relied on the plain language of the SOX whistleblower retaliation statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, to dismiss the former CEO’s claims against the directors. SOX provides a retaliation claim against a “company” with publicly-traded securities, a “nationally recognized statistical rating organization,” “or any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.” Directors are not listed in the statute. Given that SOX specifically regulates the conduct of corporate directors in other respects, the court refused to read the broad term “agent” to encompass corporate directors. The court also noted that individual directors are not ordinarily regarded as agents of the corporation for which they serve.

The New York decision splits with a 2015 decision from the Northern District of California in Wadler v. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. There, the court found that SOX’s use of the term “agent” was ambiguous and construed it to include directors. Although the Ninth Circuit ruled on appeal on various issues in the Wadler case earlier this year, it did not address the director liability issue. No federal appellate court has yet ruled on this issue, leaving the question split between the New York and California federal district courts.

Since the SOX was enacted in 2002, plaintiffs and their counsel have been testing the scope of whistleblower claim, including the individuals and entities – such as directors – that can be held liable. Director liability is worth closely watching with D&O insurance rates reportedly on the rise due to an uptick in shareholder litigation."," Threaten, not specified below",3
35362,4fc9e27b8582f1a82146a4203061152e,"WINNIPEG – OPINION – Winnipeg Police Chief Danny Smyth has a typical challenge on his hands: crime is up, resources are stretched and more money is needed. Behind the scenes, he must also be seen as preserving the interests of his officers and the police association.

The Winnipeg Police Board and municipal politicians have their perpetual challenges: be perceived as hard on crime, manage tax revenues and maintain the electorate’s confidence, while keeping the powerful and influential police lobby on side.

Winnipeg is experiencing increased levels of crime. According to Statistics Canada , Winnipeg is the violent crime capital of Canada with a rate of 153.5 violent crimes per 100,000 people, up from 150 the previous year, and ahead of Thunder Bay (140.7), Saskatoon (107.9) and Edmonton (107.0). Winnipeg is well above the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) with the lowest violent crime severity index (VCSIs): St. Catharines-Niagara (46.2), Barrie (54.0) and Trois-Rivières (56.8).

So it’s difficult to argue against the fractional increase in police budget being advocated by Smyth. The difficulty is that operational and capital police budgets have historically only ever increased. One would be hard-pressed to find instances where police budgets have contracted, even when crime rates have gone down significantly.

Despite the investments in analytics and community programs, police leaders can’t definitively demonstrate the impact of policing strategies on crime control, deterrence or on the effective engagement of their communities.

The reporting of sexual offences against women remains dismal – and the successful prosecution of sexual assault cases even more dismal.

There’s also a lack of trust and engagement with First Nations communities and visible minorities, and there’s mistrust among youth. These are critical segments of the community whose impact is felt throughout the criminal justice system.

There’s disproportionate representation of marginalized communities, as well as those suffering from mental illnesses in the corrections system.

Shawn Atleo, former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, as far back as 2011 in the Globe and Mail noted that First Nations children are more likely to go to jail than to graduate from high school.

In 2009, then-federal correctional investigator Howard Sapers noted that the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders continued to grow and that the rate of Indigenous incarceration in 2008 was nine times the national average.

Then, in the Annual Report of the Office of the Correctional Investigator 2013-2014 , Sapers noted that the most visible change during his tenure was the growth in the overall size, complexity, and diversity of the offender population. In particular, some of Canada’s minority, vulnerable or disadvantaged groups are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system and that the trends were accelerating within federal prisons.

He reported that starting in March 2005, the federal inmate population increased by 17.5 and that during the same period, the Indigenous prison population grew by 47.4 percent and black offenders by over 75 percent.

He also noted that the federally-sentenced population of women increased by 66 percent, with the Indigenous women count growing by 112 percent.

Sapers warned that the incarceration of Indigenous people was rapidly approaching the same status as that of blacks, Hispanics and impoverished whites in the United States.

Ivan Zinger, now the federal correctional investigator, paints a similarly grim portrait of federal prison life, citing high rates of mental illness, self-injury, and premature death, as well as the longstanding overrepresentation of Indigenous people. Zinger calls this state of affairs “completely unacceptable” and one that violates international human rights standards.

What Smyth is asking for is a temporary solution to a problem that has historic roots and is the catalyst for future crises. Smyth should be demanding a commitment by Winnipeg officials to treat the crisis as a public health challenge rather than the narrower response being advocated.

His alternative is a status quo response: more enforcement, demand for freedom to do street checks, stiffer sentences, and more over time. Hot-spot analysis and enforcement, further criminalization of already marginalized communities, and risking even further loss of trust and co-operation should no longer be the preferred and convenient response.

Smyth has a problem on his hands. What is he prepared to do that’s different?

But the political drumbeats are growing louder — at home and abroad — as the federal Liberals come closer to deciding whether to let a Chinese telecom firm help build Canada's next-generation mobile networks.

The development of 5G, or fifth-generation, networks will give people speedier connections and provide vast data capacity to meet the ceaseless demand for emerging applications, like virtual reality and autonomous driving, as more and more things link to the internet.

In Canada, China-based Huawei Technologies, Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are among the leading candidates to help telecommunication firms such as BCE and Telus build their 5G networks.

Pressure to limit Huawei

The opposition Conservatives are pressing the Liberals to deny Huawei a role in assembling the country's 5G infrastructure, alleging it will allow Beijing to spy on Canadians more easily.

Some security experts say Huawei's participation could give it access to an array of digital data gleaned from how, when and where Canadian customers use their electronic devices. In turn, the theory goes, Chinese security agencies could pressure the company into handing over the personal information.

Such fears stem from the fact China's National Intelligence Law plainly states that Chinese organizations and citizens shall support, assist and co-operate with state intelligence work.

At a forum in Halifax last November, Donald Trump's national security adviser urged Ottawa to bar Huawei from 5G efforts because the technology would be used as a ""Trojan horse"" to undermine Canada.

Harjit Singh Sajjan, minister of national defence, arrives for the opening news briefing before the start of the Halifax International Security Forum in Halifax on Friday November 22, 2019. U.S. delegates warned Canada at the conference about the security risks associated with Huawei. (Tim Krochak/The Canadian Press)

The warning came a day after China's ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, dismissed the notion Huawei could compromise users' security by installing ""back-door"" channels in equipment, calling it a ""groundless accusation.""

Huawei emphasizes it is not a state-controlled enterprise and that it would never do the bidding of spymasters from China or any other country.

Benjamin Howes, a Huawei Canada vice-president for international media affairs, notes the company's involvement in Canada's existing 4G networks has never led to any such security incident.

He points to Huawei's $650-million investment in research and development in Canada since 2009, with major labs in Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, Ont., Montreal and Vancouver, as well as plans for one in Quebec City.

""In every country where we have a business presence, we're committed to complying with the applicable laws and regulations, and Canada is no different,"" Howes said. ""So we will continue to be compliant, as we have been over the decade that we've been here, with Canadian laws and regulations.""

Decision expected soon

Ottawa is carrying out a comprehensive review of Huawei's potential role in 5G that includes a broader, strategic look at how the technology can foster economic growth.

Given the scope of the review, several agencies — Public Safety Canada, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Communications Security Establishment, Global Affairs and Innovation, Science and Economic Development — are taking part.

""We will ensure that our networks are kept secure and will take the appropriate decisions in due course,"" said Scott Bardsley, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.

The government has been tight-lipped about the exercise, but the results are expected relatively soon.

""We respect the process, and we just hope that it's going to be based on technology and security, not politics,"" Howes said.

However, the public debate already has been tinged by political developments.

Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei executive, in December 2018 at the request of the United States, where she is wanted over allegations of violating sanctions on Iran. Her extradition case is before a Canadian court.

The move angered Beijing and two Canadians working in China were arrested soon after on vague allegations of endangering national security — a move widely seen as retaliation against Ottawa.

Five Eyes allies

The U.S. and Australia, key intelligence allies of Canada, already have taken steps to curb Huawei's participation in 5G networks.

Canada will be watching closely for Britain's coming decision on Huawei's participation in its 5G projects. If Boris Johnson's new government adopts the Australian and U.S. line, it could be more politically challenging for Canada to embrace Huawei.

Ottawa's examination of 5G technology and the associated security and economic dimensions will include ""the careful consideration of our allies' advice,"" Bardsley said.

For its part, Huawei insists it will remain committed to Canada, no matter how the 5G microchips fall.

""Regardless of the decision, our position is we will continue to serve our customers in Canada with our products and networks,"" Howes said. ""And we will continue to enhance our investments in R and D."""," Threaten, not specified below",3

35553,db46d64fb5218b66c9aee25afc0a3fc9,"Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann on Monday filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Mississippi River Commission because of the extended release of fresh water into the saltwater Mississippi Sound from the Bonnet Carré Spillway.

The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for South Mississippi seeks a temporary injunction to order the corps to operate the Bonnet Carré in conjunction with the Morganza Spillway and to mitigate damage to the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

The Morganza Spillway diverts water from the Mississippi River into the Atchafalaya Basin and River in Louisiana.

“As state land Commissioner and trustee of the Public Trust Lands, it is my duty to protect Mississippi’s land, its water and its resources,” Hosemann said in a news release after he made the public announcement. The infiltration of fresh water into the Mississippi Sound as a result of solely opening the Bonnet Carré caused devastating effects across the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

“This lawsuit does not address the monetary loss to the State and the Coast. This could be addressed in future litigation.”

The lawsuit further alleges the extended release was taken without the benefit of an up-to-date Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), giving no consideration of the environmental impact to the Mississippi Sound and Mississippi’s Public Trust Tidelands.

Thus Hosemann is seeking to compel the defendants to perform a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement as well as to utilize the Morganza Spillway to mitigate the freshwater inundation of the Mississippi Sound in the future.

In July, Hosemann asked the Corps and the Commission to: 1.) conduct an immediate study of the operating manuals and procedures for both the Morganza Floodway and the Bonnet Carré Spillway and 2.) include as part of the study, the ecological effects and economic impacts of freshwater intrusion into the Mississippi Sound as a result of the current operating procedures.

The freshwater intrusion into the Mississippi Sound from the Bonnet Carré Spillway negatively impacted oyster, shrimp, blue crab, and fish harvests and caused devastating losses to commercial fisherman, charter boat operators, and the tourism industry.

In August, Hosemann requested additional modeling of the opening of the Morganza Floodway in varying amounts and later in the month testified before the commission on the annual low-water inspection trip in Vicksburg where he reiterated all of these requests. Additionally, Hosemann, along with the Department of Marine Resources, requested an Environmental Impact Study.

In a last-minute order issued on Tuesday, a federal judge temporarily blocked California from enforcing its new gig-worker-classification law, Assembly Bill 5, against independent truck drivers.

AB5, which makes it significantly harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors, went into effect on Wednesday. But on Tuesday evening, US District Judge Roger Benitez issued a temporary restraining order that prevents the state from enforcing the law against ""owner-operators,"" or independent truck drivers.

In November, the California Trucking Association filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern District of California asking the court to declare independent truck drivers exempt from the law.

""AB 5 threatens the livelihood of more than 70,000 independent truckers,"" CTA CEO Shawn Yadon said in a statement at the time, adding ""the bill wrongfully restricts their ability to provide services as owner-operators and, therefore, runs afoul of federal law.""

Benitez said in Tuesday's order that emergency relief was justified as the CTA had shown that ""(1) that they are likely to succeed on the merits, (2) likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in their favor, and (4) that their requested relief is in the public interest.""

A hearing is scheduled for January 13, at which the court will hear arguments from both sides over whether the temporary exemption should continue for the duration of the legal proceedings.

AB5, which was introduced largely in response to the rise of gig-economy companies that rely heavily on independent contractors, has spurred a heated debate in the state and could have a major effect on how those businesses operate.

African lions are currently listed as ""vulnerable"" on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. In some parts of Africa, they are listed as ""critically endangered,"" largely due to habitat destruction.

Joseph Garcia, 39, appeared before Putnam County Common Pleas Court Judge Keith Schierloh, who set Garcia’s final pretrial for 3:30 p.m. Feb. 13. A jury trial was set at 8:30 a.m. March 10. Garcia appeared in court with his attorney, Alex Treece. Todd Schroeder, assistant prosecuting attorney, also was present in the courtroom.

Schierloh said Court Diagnostics in Toledo completed an evaluation and found Garcia was competent to stand trial.

Garcia was arrested and booked into the Putnam County Jail on June 20 on a rape charge for a May 28 alleged rape that occurred in Leipsic. His bond remains at $150,000.

According to an incident report filed with the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office, on May 28, deputies said they interviewed the 14-year-old victim, who was babysitting at a home. Garcia also lived at the home, and she said he came home from work and went upstairs. The victim and the children were downstairs playing. After she had cooked food, Garcia came downstairs and began playing with her and the children, according to the report.

At some point, Garcia allegedly pulled the victim by her hair and made her go upstairs to his bedroom and locked the door, according to the report. Garcia threw her down onto his bed and told her to take her clothes off, according to the report.

She reported he raped her repeatedly and that she told him to stop, but he didn’t.

The victim said an adult came home and knocked on the bedroom door but did not get a response. A short time later, another adult pounded on the door asking what they were doing in the bedroom.

The report stated Garcia opened the door and said he and the victim were playing video games.

The adult took the girl downstairs and asked her what they were doing and, according to the report, she stated, “he raped me.”

She was asked if he had done this before, and she said no. A rape kit was conducted on the victim, and a search and arrest warrant was made on Garcia.

Responding to a point of order raised by MNA Raja Riaz, the minister said the increased rate of fine on violations was scheduled to be implemented from January 1, but the decision has been put on hold. He said that decision for the implementation of the fine will be taken after consultation with all the stakeholders. However, he was of the view that the rate of fine on violations was increased to ensure the safety of the people and not to enhance revenue. He said that increased fine on traffic violations will in fact decrease the revenue, as people will start following the rules.

The minister said under the sustainable development goals, the ministry was given a target to decrease the rate of accidents in Pakistan. He said in order to address the issue of safety, the government for the first time has made a road safety policy. The fines have been increased with an objective of decreasing the accidents, he said, and expressed the hope that after the implementation of increase of fine on violations, accident rate will decrease in the country by 50 percent.

The minister also apprised the Lower House that instructions have been issued to the ministries of industries and food to protect rights of the sugarcane growers.

“The PDP dismisses the reasons being spewed by the APC administration for this New Year dastardly act as baseless, false and incongruous, as they fail to add up, to justify the ferocious invasion, harassment of citizens and demolition of the said property.”

© Oleksii Terpugov | Dreamstime.com

The World Health Organisation recommends limiting free sugar consumption to 25 grams (6 teaspoons) a day. Free sugar includes table sugar, honey, the natural sugar in fruit juice and the sugar hidden in processed food.

Sugar consumption is a factor behind rising obesity, which cuts nearly two years from Swiss life expectancy and costs the country around CHF 8 billion a year.

In Switzerland sugar is produced from sugar beet. In 2018, taxpayers spent CHF 33 million on payments to Swiss sugar beet growers, according to Dr. Patrick Dümmler at Avenir Suisse. In 2019, the annual subsidy rose 17% to CHF 2,100 per hectare, so total taxpayer spending on sugar is likely to be higher in 2019.

In addition to taxpayer support, the price Swiss farmers get for their sugar is further boosted at the expense of consumers, who must swallow duty on imported sugar of CHF 2 to CHF 7 per kilogram.

Sugar is also among the products the government stockpiles for times of crisis, an action that helps to further buoy its price.

NASA leaders Hon Raila Odinga and Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka.

Pure political high octane is the fuel that Kenya is set to ride on in 2020, with succession machinations in the driver’s seat. While President Uhuru Kenyatta has a solid 32 months left in the saddle, those who would aspire to the throne will not wait. They say chance favours the prepared.The main players in the succession arena have already begun saddling their horses. Throughout 2019, ODM Party Leader Raila Odinga echoed President Kenyatta’s call for politicians to place succession issues on the back burner for a while. Yet this did not happen. Deputy President William Ruto was in the lead, with Raila himself in tow. The DP traversed the country, keeping the engines warm for the big race ahead. Raila followed, doing everything possible to cool off the DP’s steam. Ruto shook off adverse criticism that mostly targeted his generous contributions to harambees. Efforts to demonise the largely unknown sources of his massive funds did not slow him down. We can expect to see more of that as the race to 2022 enters a new phase. He will be berated in equal measure. United party The first quarter of the year looks set to be especially politically choking. Jubilee Party Secretary General Raphael Tuju has said the party will hold elections in March.

For More of This and Other Stories, Grab Your Copy of the Standard Newspaper. Read Now »

This already appears too soon for a party that seems to be at war with itself. Can they hold elections all the way to the national level and still emerge as one united party? The rift grows by the day, between the Ruto-led Tangatanga strand of Jubilee and the Uhuru-leaning Kieleweke. Tuju’s statement on looming party elections was laced with ominous innuendo against the deputy president. It would seem that the main objective of the elections is to paralyse the DP’s influence in the party and the country. Even more confounding have been statements by former Gatanga MP David Murathe. Murathe, a close friend and confidant of the president, resigned in a huff from the position of Jubilee deputy chairman. It is not clear, therefore, why he still seems to speak for the party. Regardless, his word cannot be taken lightly. He has stated categorically that Uhuru will be one of the contenders for political power in 2022. Murathe’s resignation last year was prompted by disputes about the Uhuru succession. He had caused concern in Tangatanga by stating that the people of Central Kenya would not support the DP’s quest for power in 2022. They owed him nothing, Murathe said, further advising Ruto to retire with Uhuru. It will be interesting to see how things turn out here. The chances look more likely that the Jubilee elections could be put off to a later date – if ever they take place. The party needs significant levels of unity, even if of a strained nature, in the face of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). Secret pact The BBI is set to be a big agenda this year. It has operated in stormy waters from the very outset. Primed as a function of a secret pact between Uhuru and Raila, BBI often runs into headwinds both within Jubilee and from outside. Every politician who considers their future at risk because of BBI is likely to fight it. The president may wish to minimise collateral damage against BBI by finding ways to get Tangatanga to tone down their rhetoric against it. Shouting them down is unlikely to be a judicious route. There is every likelihood of sustained hostile debate about the BBI, with much of it generating more heat than light. Already, ODM plans to hold a rally in Kakamega on January 18 to drum up support for the BBI. The rally is fronted by Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Western political leadership affiliated to Amani National Congress’ (ANC) Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula has already raised the red flag. They smell mischief in the proposed rally. They think the meeting is about undermining Mudavadi and Wetang’ula in their own backyard, while hoisting Raila. Whatever the case, the battle for control of Western is going to go up a notch higher. Not to be left behind in this contest will be the deputy president. He already wields some significant influence in the region. Jubilee’s Tangatanga boasts of MPs Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Benard Shinali (Ikolomani), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Malulu Injendi (Malava), John Waluke (Sirisia) and Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), in the Mudavadi-Wetang’ula backyard. Faced with a common threat from ODM, it will be interesting to see whether Wetang’ula and Mudavadi will close ranks to counter the adversary, or whether they will carry on in the fractious manner that is the trademark of Luhya politics. Equally interesting will be whether they can bite the political bullet and close ranks further with the deputy president, or whether caution about the unknown response will keep them wary of the DP. ODM also has its own internal issues to address. An internal party task force report last year returned a harsh verdict against the Edwin Sifuna-led party secretariat. It recommended a wide raft of changes in the leadership of the party and in management style. The report just fell short of advising the removal of Sifuna and the party’s executive officer Oduor Ong’wen. Mercifully, ODM redeemed itself in the Kibra by-election in November. Whether this is considered good enough to slow down on ODM’s much spoken about impending shake-up remains to be seen. Like Jubilee, ODM needs calm and unity of purpose in this season when the BBI is Raila’s foremost agenda. Mudavadi’s ANC was in the news much of last year for the wrong reasons. The party rode into 2019 on the wave of tussles over the office of secretary general between nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi and Mudavadi’s new political ally Barrack Muluka. After a succession of contestations in court and before the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal (PPDT), the Mudavadi corner carried the day, with Osotsi failing to appeal the decision of the High Court that declared Muluka the legitimate secretary general. Then came the party’s expulsion of Osotsi, allegedly for refusing or failing to co-operate with the party in an audit carried out by the office of the Auditor General. Osotsi appealed against the expulsion and won the first round before the PPDT. The matter now rests with the High Court, following an appeal by the party. Away from this, ANC is fraught with internal indiscipline that it must end before it can focus meaningfully on competition against other parties. MPs and county assemblies openly defy the leadership and push the agenda of competing parties at the expense of their own party. The matter of the expulsion of Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala late last year has been largely hushed up. It is, however, likely to begin hitting headlines this year. Wiper Party’s Kalonzo Musyoka has declared 2020 the year when he begins to take over from Uhuru. It is not clear how he intends to go about this, having declared that wherever the president will be in 2022, that is where he will also be. But one of his closest political allies, former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama, says they are going to support Ruto. Kalonzo was quick to deny this. He denounced Muthama for purporting to speak for him. He is going to be an interesting one to watch this year. While Raila has the BBI and handshake agenda as his beacons, it is not clear what the other major players’ beacons are going to be. Mudavadi has been talking about the economy, the cost of living and such other matters as over borrowing and corruption. He is likely to travel with the same messages. As an addition, and possibly to counter the onslaught against him by Atwoli, he has recently added the plight of workers, a real felt challenge in the country. It will be interesting to see how he develops this line, or whether he will go into a ceasefire with Atwoli and drop it. Kalonzo and Wetang’ula have yet to state what their campaign planks are. They need to craft and position some pretty soon. What should Kenyans think of whenever they hear about them? This is the homework they must begin their succession efforts with. For Ruto, it remains a balance between associating himself with any gains in the Jubilee government while distancing himself from the failings. It is a tricky balance. Regardless of the president’s own agenda, his dreams and aspirations for himself and the country, the contenders for the throne will hugely set their own agenda for the country and for the president. The Big Four Agenda, the economy, education, peace and harmony, BBI, devolution, foreign debts, corruption and all other issues will be important to the political class only to the extent that they further self-focused 2022 dreams. The race begins in earnest this year.

As an ethicist and physician, I have been struggling to come up with a term that summarizes the potent combination of ignorance and immorality that characterizes certain elements in American society today. My breakthrough came upon reading about former Kentucky governor Matt Bevin’s pardon of a 41-year-old man sentenced to 23 years in prison in 2018 after being convicted of rape, incest, sodomy and other sexual offenses. According to the Washington Post,1 Bevin justified the pardon on the theory that a 9-year-old girl could not have been raped because her hymen was intact. This, despite medical testimony from Dr George Nichols, an expert in evaluating child abuse, who pointed out that inspecting an alleged victim’s hymen cannot prove whether they were sexually assaulted; indeed, most survivors of child sexual abuse do not have any physical damage.

Dr Nichols commented that Bevin “clearly doesn’t know medicine and anatomy” and that “Rape is not proved by hymen penetration.” According to the Post, “Lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum have called for an independent investigation into Bevin’s flurry of last-minute pardons, citing concerns that some were granted as favors to supporters.”1 The mother of the young girl likened the pardon to a “slap in the face” and was trying to get an emergency protective order—or possibly moving to another part of the country.

How best to describe the combination of ignorance and immorality in the former governor’s action? I have settled on the portmanteau word, immoronic: a combination of immorality and moronic. Examples of the immoronic are not hard to find in modern American culture, and they transcend any one political party or ideology.

Immoronic antivaxers

It would be a mistake to assume that everyone who traffics in the immoronic is a “moron,” in the colloquial sense of “a very stupid person.” There are certainly people of apparently high intelligence who, nevertheless, propound immoronic views. Consider the case of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.—the son of Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy. RFK Jr is among the most prominent “antivaxxers” in the United States.

For several years now, this Harvard-educated attorney and adjunct professor of environmental law has been spouting dangerous drivel about a (non-existent) causal link between vaccinations and autism—so much so, that his own family has denounced him. They have noted that, “He has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines.”2

Similarly, health care workers who refuse to get the influenza or measles vaccine—thus endangering those they care for—are engaging in immoronic behavior, in my view. Dr Holly Kramer,3 president of the National Kidney Foundation, has pointed out that patients receiving dialysis, for example, are at particular risk of flu complications, owing to their weakened immune systems. “The health care workers need to be vaccinated because dialysis patients are more likely to develop severe influenza and need to be hospitalized and can die from influenza,” Kramer said.

In my view, health care workers have no reasonable excuse for refusing the flu shot, if they continue to work in a public health setting. It is also depressing to learn that 37% of American adults don't plan to get flu shots this season, according to a recent poll—probably owing to the fear generated by purveyors of immoronic misinformation.4

Climate change and the immoronic

Then, of course, there are the climate change deniers. Few groups have managed to combine the immoral and the moronic more dangerously than the (mostly right-wing) purveyors of this benighted ideology. It may seem odd to attribute “immorality” to a narrative concerning the earth’s climate, but if befouling the planet’s ecosystems and polluting our air and oceans is not immoral, I am not sure what is. (In addition, the adverse effects of climate change on mental health have been discussed in Psychiatric Times by several psychiatrists).5,6

Yet some very influential climate change deniers insist—despite clear warnings to the contrary from climate science experts—that global warming is a “hoax.”7

In this regard, the “2020 Immoronic Award” must surely go to physicist William Happer, a National Security Council senior director, who famously proclaimed, “The demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler.”8

Immoronic ideas directed against psychiatry and psychiatric patients

Finally, in our own bailiwick of psychiatry, we have the “mental illness deniers,” who get my vote for the most egregious form of immoronic behavior. Those who insist that psychiatric illnesses are “myths” or merely “social constructions” do enormous harm—and show great disrespect—to the millions of people who suffer with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other debilitating conditions.9

Ironically, one subgroup of antipsychiatry critics does not deny the existence of psychiatric illness. No—this group claims there is an “epidemic” of mental illness, fueled by the very medications psychiatrists use to treat psychiatric disorders.10,11 I have taken pains to debunk this claim12 which may frighten vulnerable patients into avoiding or discontinuing potentially life-saving medication. There is compelling evidence, for example, that lithium and clozapine have anti-suicidal effects in bipolar and psychotic disorders, respectively.13,14

The mistrust of science

In my view, there are worrisome societal trends at work that may be contributing to immoronic claims and behavior in this country (and perhaps elsewhere). In our post-modern age, the role of the “expert” has been severely undermined and discredited. Medical specialists who reassure the public that vaccinations do not cause autism are roundly ridiculed and disparaged. Climate scientists who warn of dire consequences from global warning are ignored or slandered.15

Driving the surge of immoronic ideas is a culture drowning in “alternative facts;”16 misleading internet websites; and a general distrust of science itself. A recent survey found that, globally, only 18% of people have a high level of trust in scientists.17 In the US and Canada, the figure is an underwhelming 26%. Shawn Otto, co-founder and producer of the U.S. Presidential Science Debates and author of The War on Science, recently observed “There seems to be an erosion of the standing and understanding of science and engineering among the public. People seem much more inclined to reject facts and evidence today than in the recent past.”18 Otto notes that anti-science positions are now acceptable in public discourse, in Congress, state legislatures and city councils, in popular culture, and in presidential politics.

According to hospital staff, the officers, who had accompanied the victim's parents, dropped the girl off without providing her medical history, raising suspicion.

Operations at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital were yesterday temporarily disrupted as the facility's security team and the public attempted to arrest a police officer accused of defiling a 16-year-old girl.The officer attached to Ratta police station in Seme Sub-county was in the company of three of his colleagues when they drove the victim to the hospital. According to hospital staff, the officers, who had accompanied the victim's parents, dropped the girl off without providing her medical history, raising suspicion.

On questioning, the girl's parents, who had claimed to have been threatened by the officers, opened up to the hospital staff about what had transpired. Security personnel at the main gate were instructed to block the police car from leaving. The public quickly caught up with the vehicle and attempted to eject the suspected officer from it before he was rescued by his colleagues. A push-and-pull ensued as the officers and hospital guards fought for the gate, before the public joined in, again, barricading the gate in a melee that lasted about one hour.

The police car had to be driven back to the casualty area to escape the surging angry crowd, which was threatening to lynch the suspect and torch the car. The officers called for reinforcement. With the help of the hospital's Superintendent Peter Okoth, the officers drove out towards Kondele police station amid shouts and hooting from bodaboda riders.

The girl's mother said the Form Three student had sneaked out of their home on December 31, to attend a night party at a club in Ratta. ""When she returned the following morning, we decided to take her to the police station to help us discipline her,” said the mother. The officer at the OB table asked the parents to leave the girl behind to be locked up in the cell. On January 1, the parents went back to the police station to pick her up, hoping that she ""had learnt her lesson"". “When I got to the station, I went straight to the cells and peeped through the window. I found the girl sobbing, while lying facing up. I thought she had been given some corporal punishment,” said the mother. The girl disclosed that an officer had taken her to his house, defiled her repeatedly before returning her to the cells in the wee hours of the morning.The mother demanded that the girl be taken to the hospital immediately, but she claimed police officers connived with a private hospital in the neighbouring Vihiga County, where a report was doctored to show there was no defilement. The parents disputed the report, forcing top county police officers to intervene and ask that the girl be taken to a public hospital. The officers at Ratta station refused, a move that saw the girl spend a second night in the cells. Yesterday, the parents stormed the station, forcing the police to accompany them to the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Hospital for examination. At the hospital, the parents revealed that the suspected defiler was among the officers who had dropped her off. “In normal instances, any patient brought by police must have specific handing over procedures. We were appalled when the officers declined to disclose their identities and circumstances under which they brought the patient,” said a health officer who received the girl at the hospital. Yesterday, Dr Okoth said DNA tests on the suspect would need to be done to establish the truth. County Police Commander Renson Lolmodol said the alleged defilement was reported at Ratta police station. He, however, said tests conducted by the private hospital in Vihiga had shown there had been no defilement.

The smart threat monitoring and advisory service aims to cut through the noise of threat information overload facing regional IT departments today. The MSA service notifies its clients of threats, vulnerabilities, or security concerns directly impacting their specific infrastructure, with risk mitigation steps to reduce threat impact.

“We have observed that most companies in the GCC region do not benefit from the existing threat advisory services. Most advisory services are automated and send a very large number of daily alerts, most of which are irrelevant to IT decision makers. Also, a lot of these alerts don’t apply to the GCC region, which has its own set of particular threats and issues.” said Mr. Sameer Hussain, CEO of Managed.

“In addition, some managers might be too busy to review any alerts, even important ones, which could lead to those crucial and relevant alerts and feeds being ignored. Our Managed Security Advisory Service uses a proprietary threat intelligence monitoring and classification engine, along with active human analysis and validation, to isolate the important and relevant threats from the inconsequential ones, and show clients the focused data that is needed to avert a dangerous situation, because all it takes is one little item to go unchecked for a potential data catastrophe to happen.”

Managed’s threat intelligence system collects data feeds from hundreds of vendors, developers, researchers, honeypots, and threat feed providers, with a focus on GCC and regional threats. A smart system matches the client’s specific infrastructure setup and threat information requirements to the incoming feeds using proprietary machine learning algorithms and presents to Managed’s Threat Analyst the alerts that are relevant to the clients.

The Threat Analyst then reviews the alert to ensure that it is relevant and actionable. Once it is confirmed that the alerts and threats impact the client, an advisory is created that includes information on the threat and recommended mitigation actions. The advisory is sent out immediately, with clients being notified through email, SMS and phone calls depending on the urgency of the situation. All of this is monitored 24x7x365 from Managed’s Dubai-based NOC/SOC.

All clients also get a Daily Cybersecurity Briefing that is sent early in the morning, which allows them to become up-to-date with the latest cybersecurity-related incidents and threats, in less than a minute."," Threaten, not specified below",3

ST. CLOUD — A St. Cloud man suspected in a fatal stabbing Sunday morning at the Red Carpet Nightclub made his first appearance in court Thursday morning.

Police are still searching for two other suspects. Surveillance video from the nightclub shows the three suspects had returned to the club minutes after being removed for attacking another man Sunday.

Bryant Jerome Stephenson, 27, St. Cloud, was charged with aiding and abetting murder in the second-degree without intent to kill, according to a criminal complaint filed in Stearns County District Court.

Unity McGill, 29, St. Cloud, died from stab wounds in the attack after being transported to St. Cloud Hospital.

Around 1:03 a.m., video showed the three suspects attacking an unidentified man on the dance floor, and at one point striking McGill who was standing nearby.

The video shows McGill retaliated multiple times. Bouncers removed all three suspects and the other man, while McGill remained on the dance floor.

Around 1:13 a.m., Stephenson, Lawrence Johnson and Christopher Johnson re-entered the bar, according to surveillance video. At 1:22 a.m., the three approached McGill on the dance floor and attacked him.

Bouncers attempted to remove the three suspects who continued to attack McGill as he fled through the main door. Video footage showed the suspects kicking McGill as they all fled through the main door, according to the complaint.

New Year Eve celebrations turned horribly wrong for a 16-year-old girl and her boyfriend after two persons held them captive and gang raped the girl in Aravalli near Kasan village in Manesar, an official said.

The 34-year-old accused, identified as Shravan Kumar, who is a native of Kasan; and 30-year-old Nitesh Mishra have been arrested and sent to judicial custody after they were produced before a local court.

The incident took place on December 31, 2019 when the 16-year-old girl and her 17-year-old boyfriend went to the top of Aravalli in Kasan village, to celebrate New Year's Eve.

The place where the incident took place is known as a small picnic spot, which is popular for a good view. While the duo was clicking a selfie on the mountain range, both Kumar and Mishra, who were also at the spot - tried to assault her as no other person was present there.

""The accused misbehaved with the girl and used abusive language. They overpowered the couple after they showed resistance,"" said the ACP of south district, Sushila.

Mishra dragged the boy to a nearby place from the crime scene and Kumar threatened the girl of dire consequences and raped her.

After Kumar, Mishra also raped the girl. The victims asked for help after they saw some more persons approaching to the spot. They chased the accused and nabbed them till police personnel arrived on the spot.

The victims also alleged that the accused had made videos of the sexual assault. The accused also threatened to upload the video clips on social media.

The police, however, did not find any such video clip from their cellphones. ""We have sent the mobile phones for forensic examination and discover deleted items,"" Sushila added.", Sexually assault,3
36577,19e044d61f5b84dbaa95dfc453bb122c,"E-cigarettes and vaping garnered a lot of attention in 2019, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services took notice. On Thursday, the agency announced a new enforcement policy that targets vape products especially enticing to young people, as the government takes steps to curb the prevalence of vaping among America's youth.

The policy is fairly specific when it comes to the types of e-cigarette products it will target. In the federal crosshairs are pod- or cartridge-based e-cigarettes, such as the popular Juul product, and vape flavors such as mint that are likely to appeal to children.

By May 12, manufacturers of e-cigarettes that remain on the market will have to apply for authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to keep their products on store shelves. Cartridge-based systems will only be allowed to offer tobacco and menthol flavors, as research shows these are the least popular flavors among youth.

E-cigarettes that operate on an open tank system -- in which users add flavors manually -- have a little more breathing room under the new enforcement policy, although manufacturers of open tank e-cigarettes will still be required to apply for FDA clearance. Open tank products are generally larger and more cumbersome than the Juul, rendering them far less attractive to children, who tend to sneak vapes into school bathrooms.

The primary reason for the more relaxed enforcement of open tank systems is to keep products on the market that may allow adults to transition away from traditional, combustible cigarettes. While the administration's stated priority is to curb e-cigarette use among children and younger Americans, HHS Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday that research shows vaping is likely less harmful than smoking, and adults older than 21 should still have it as an option.

""We've developed a smart, targeted policy protecting our kids without causing unnecessary disruption,"" said Azar. ""Vaping shouldn't be an on-ramp for children to become addicted, it should be an off-ramp for adults looking to break away from traditional cigarettes.""

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn cited figures Thursday showing that about 3.6 million American children used vaping products in 2019, with 1.6 million using them frequently and for long durations. Overwhelmingly, youth prefer pod- or cartridge-based e-cigarettes such as Juul, and flavors such as mint and mango.

""Using e-cigarettes puts them at risk for nicotine addiction and other health consequences,"" said Hahn. ""We're ready to take action against any unauthorized e-cigarette products. The FDA will take additional steps … if necessary.""

According to Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, beginning 30 days from publication of the guidance in the federal register, the government will focus on products that don't have pre-market authorization, as well as flavored products that are not tobacco or menthol. Manufacturers will also be subject to FDA action if they fail to take appropriate steps to keep e-cigarettes away from children.

""Companies that do not comply with existing pre-market requirements and cease manufacture of cartridge-based e-cigarettes … risk FDA enforcement actions,"" said Zeller. ""For all other products, the FDA will also prioritize enforcement where the manufacturers fail to take adequate measures to prevent children's use of these products,"" including the use of robust age verification technology on their websites.

Zeller said there would be a minimal impact on vape shops provided they sell non-cartridge-based products and adequately verify the ages of their customers.

Manufacturers submitting applications to the FDA can keep their products on the market for a 12-month period from the time the application is received. The products will be removed from the market after 12 months if they have not received FDA approval.

THE LARGER TREND

A rash of vaping-related lung injuries incited worry in 2019, as vaping-associated illnesses led to 40 deaths across the country. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Evali, the lung disease associated with vaping, has been linked to vitamin E acetate -- a solution most commonly found in black-market THC vaping cartridges, and rarely found in e-cigarette products. Though vitamin E acetate seems to be the most likely culprit, health officials caution it's too soon to rule out other causes.

The CDC has reported that 86% of the people who had become ill from vaping had used THC vaping products during the previous three months. THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, is illegal in most countries, perhaps explaining why Evali outbreaks have not been reported elsewhere. While THC does not cause Evali, unscrupulous manufacturers in states where cannabis is still illegal have sometimes mixed it with vitamin E acetate in cartridge-based vaping products.

The American Medical Association has called for thorough study of the use of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies for tobacco use disorder and nicotine dependence resulting from the use of non-combustible and combustible tobacco products in people under 18. The agency has also signaled its intent to persuade retail pharmacies to cease sales of tobacco products, and is advocating for diagnostic codes for e-cigarette and vaping associated illnesses, including pulmonary toxicity.

ON THE RECORD

Dr. Patrice A. Harris, president of the American Medical Association said, ""The Administration's new policy to address the youth e-cigarette epidemic by limiting flavors in some vaping products is a step in the right direction, but does not go far enough. The AMA is disappointed that menthol flavors – one of the most popular – will still be allowed, and that flavored e-liquids will remain on the market, leaving young people with easy access to alternative flavored e-cigarette products.""

36628,4ed37cc87d852f550ebd98ca35dbd9cb,"$3 million bail for optometrist charged in Schaumburg slaying

Bail was set at $3 million Thursday for an Algonquin eye doctor who authorities say stabbed his girlfriend to death in November in the woman's Schaumburg home.

Anthony R. Prate, 55, who had optometry offices in Barrington and Lake Zurich, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Malgorzata B. ""Margaret"" Daniel, 48.

He would have to post 10%, or $300,000, to be released pending trial. He would live with his mother in Tinley Park, have to wear a GPS device and be subject to electronic home monitoring, Associate Judge Steven J. Gaebel ruled.

Prate's 19-year-old son, Nicolas, and 17-year-old daughter, Ava, testified at the hearing at the Rolling Meadows courthouse. So did his sister, a niece and an ex-girlfriend.

Nicolas called his father ""a good community guy."" Ava said her dad was ""funny, loving, energetic and encouraging,"" and that he was a favorite dad among her friends.

The ex-girlfriend, Meritza Witte, said they dated for almost five years after the death of his wife and remained friendly.

She described herself as ""hot-tempered"" and prone to picking arguments but said Prate was never violent with her. Asked if she feared for her safety if he were to be released from jail, she replied, ""Oh God, no. Because there is no way he would do this.""

Nicolas Prate, who is attending college, admitted under questioning from Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Denise Loiterstein that the children still have access to their father's money.

Nicolas Prate also confirmed that in a call from his police jail cell, the elder Prate said the children would be taken care of because the mortgage on their house was paid off and money was set aside for their college educations.

Prate's attorney, Sam Amirante, asked for bail of $1 million. Loiterstein objected to Prate's being allowed out on bail at all.

""He's not a criminal at all. Who else is in danger here?"" Amirante argued.

Loiterstein said they were discussing bail only because Prate used a knife, not a gun. ""This defendant does not deserve a bond. And electronic monitoring is a luxury,"" she said.

In a 911 call released by police, Prate said he and Daniel had a fight and that Daniel stabbed him first.

Authorities say Prate stabbed Daniel 20 to 30 times in the early morning of Nov. 23 after a dinner party she hosted at her house on Arbor Glen Boulevard the previous night. Prosecutors say the guests discussed the topic of their father's death, which appeared to upset Prate, who left the room for a long period and returned noticeably agitated.

About 1:30 a.m., police say, Prate called 911 indicating Daniel was ""gravely wounded.""

When police officers arrived at the house, they found Daniel in the kitchen, not breathing.

A medical examiner ruled Daniel's death a homicide.

Loiterstein said there were wounds to her back, chest, legs, arms, and her right side.

Loiterstein said that before calling 911, Prate texted his daughter at 1:08 a.m., writing, ""I love you very much. I'm sorry. Something very bad has happened."" He then texted his son the same message, adding that Daniel had tried to stab him, Loiterstein said.

The case sparked the interest of McHenry County authorities, who announced Dec. 9 they are monitoring the Schaumburg investigation to determine if any information from it relates to the death of Prate's wife, Bridget Prate, who was pronounced dead after a March 2011 car crash in Lake in the Hills.", Kill by physical assault,3

Debra Conlon of Grain Farmers of Ontario described how the public narrative that neonics were killing honeybees stymied farmers’ best efforts to ameliorate the problem.

It was determined that dust during seeding, exacerbated by an unusually hot March in 2013, was partly to blame.

BASF came up with a dust suppressant, which farmers adopted en masse. It lowered bee mortality by 90 percent.

It wasn’t enough. Public opinion had been damaged. The message that honeybees were under threat led everyone from General Mills, maker of Cheerios, to various environmental groups to jump on the bandwagon. Conlon describes a meeting she attended at the University of Guelph organized by the David Suzuki Foundation, where the crowd was urged to start a grassroots campaign to ban neonics.

“The fellow that was leading it was a pretty senior guy at Suzuki Foundation and he said the image of the bee … was the most successful campaign they had ever run, and by that meaning the most profitable campaign that they’ve ever run.”

In the end, neonics were banned in 2015 in Ontario. Conlon said farmers are now paying three times the price of what they used to pay for neonic-treated seed, for an alternative that is less effective.

While the Ontario government is reconsidering its regulations, Health Canada, through its Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA), is proposing a phase out some applications of neonics, such as spraying on fruit trees and municipal parks, while allowing confined spraying in greenhouses and in seed treatments such as canola."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Prisons across the state were put under lockdown after what the Mississippi Department of Corrections called a ""major disturbance"" Sunday at the South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Greene County. Inmate Terrandance Dobbins was killed and two others were hurt. An autopsy is being performed to determine the 40-year-old's cause of death, corrections officials said.

On Tuesday at Parchman, 25-year-old inmate Walter Gates died and several others were injured during a fight among prisoners. The fight broke out around 9 p.m. in one unit and spread to others around the prison, Burton told news outlets. Burton said Gates suffered multiple stab wounds. He was in prison after being convicted of burglary in Coahoma County in 2015.

Then one inmate was killed and two were injured in a fight early Thursday at Chickasaw County Regional Correctional Facility, a county-run facility that holds state inmates.

“We had it under control in three minutes,” Chickasaw County Sheriff Jim Meyers told The Associated Press.

He said investigators were questioning inmates to find out what caused the fight.

Meyers identified the dead man as 26-year-old Gregory Emary, of Hernando. Emary was serving a 16-year sentence for burglary.

One inmate underwent surgery at a Tupelo hospital and was in intensive care, Meyers said. The third inmate was taken to a hospital in Calhoun City and treated for cuts to the head. The sheriff's department did not name the injured inmates.

The lockdown means that inmates can't go outside, make phone calls or receive visitors. The Corrections Department announced Thursday that the ban on visitors will extend through at least this weekend.

“All available resources are being used to address disturbances occurring around the state,” the statement said. “The MDOC is being responsive in investigating the violence.”

The violence came even as U.S. District Judge William Barbour ruled Tuesday that while conditions may have previously been poor at East Mississippi Correctional Facility near Meridian, there's no longer any evidence that the privately run prison is violating inmates' rights.

A lawsuit suit filed in 2013 alleged that inmates were being systematically denied health care and mental health care, were in danger of violence from guards and other prisoners, and were forced into long stretches in solitary confinement, where cells were often dark and where inmates often set fires.

“While plaintiffs and their expert witnesses argue that environment and healthcare services at the prison could and should be better, those arguments do not establish that the conditions under which they are currently housed, as a class, are cruel and unusual,” Barbour wrote in his ruling.

The judge wrote that he believed that conditions had improved after former Corrections Commissioner Christopher Epps resigned in November 2014. Epps was later convicted of taking more than $1.4 million in bribes. One of the people who pleaded guilty to bribing Epps was Dr. Carl Reddix, whose company previously had a contract to provide medical and mental health care at East Mississippi. Barbour said that the bribes “likely affected the quality of care that was being provided to prisoners as well as other conditions at the facility.”

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of inmates by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Neither of those groups nor the state immediately commented Thursday on the ruling. Grace Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections, didn't comment directly on the ruling but wrote in an email that “linking the ruling to what is going on now is plainly unfair.”

Expert witnesses testified that care at the prison, which holds male inmates who mostly have been diagnosed with mental illness, was substandard. But Barbour ruled that those experts' opinions didn't reach the “very high bar” needed to prove that state officials were deliberately indifferent to inmates' needs. He wrote that the state had improved health care, mental health care, staffing and the physical conditions at the prison during the course of the lawsuit, finding that “the manner in which the prison was being operated did not remain stagnant.”

Mississippi Corrections Commissioner Pelicia Hall announced Tuesday that she will resign in mid-January to take a job in the private sector, signaling that incoming Gov. Tate Reeves won't retain her after he takes office on Jan. 14. Hall is one of several state agency directors departing.

36676,15593cddbacf7ac494db5d7b28db14e4,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Rhode Island's health department is proposing to permanently ban the sale of flavored vaping products in the state.

The department issued a public notice last week that it wants to make the temporary ban currently in effect permanent. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo supports a permanent ban.

A hearing is set for Jan. 7 at the health department in Providence.

Spokesman Joseph Wendelken said Tuesday the department is acting now because the temporary ban will soon lapse, and it wants to prevent teenagers and adolescents from vaping, given the significant health concerns.

Neighboring Massachusetts last month became the first state in the country to ban the sale of all flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, e-cigarettes and e-liquids. It came after Republican Gov. Charlie Baker declared a public health emergency and imposed a temporary ban in September.

Raimondo signed an executive order in September banning the sale of flavored vaping products. In response, the health department issued emergency regulations Oct. 4 to implement a four-month ban, with an optional two-month extension.

Raimondo said this month that she wants to permanently ban flavored vaping products to protect children.

""This is an epidemic and we have to take action,"" she said. ""These companies are deliberately targeting addictive tobacco products to our children, resulting in kids who are 10, 11, 12 years old, addicted to tobacco products. We've got to do something. It's much more pernicious, actually, than smoking.""

Raimondo said the state shouldn't ban all vaping products because public health experts say the products may help some cigarette smokers quit.

The vaping industry has criticized bans on flavored products, calling them the wrong approach to the problem of youth vaping. The Vapor Technology Association has said that a better strategy is raising the age to purchase tobacco and nicotine vapor products to 21 and imposing stricter marketing standards on smoking companies.

The minimum age to purchase all tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, was just raised from 18 to 21 nationwide. The provision to raise the legal limit was in a massive spending bill passed by Congress and signed by the president Dec. 20.

Rhode Island's health department says in its public notice it considered alternative approaches, overlap with other regulatory provisions, and the economic impact on small businesses before proposing to permanently ban the sale of flavored vaping products. It says it identified no alternative approach or overlap and found the benefits of the proposed rule justify the costs.

The department is accepting public comment until Jan. 26. It can amend the state's health regulations after going through the established process of proposing an amendment and collecting public comment."," Threaten non-force, not specified below",3

The former director of Vote Leave published a 2,900-word advert aimed at mathematicians, data scientists, economists, software developers and PR experts.

One of the successful applicants will get to work as Mr Cummings’ personal assistant for a year, according to Thursday’s post on his blog.

“We want to hire an unusual set of people with different skills and backgrounds to work in Downing Street with the best officials,” he wrote.

It follows reports that Boris Johnson is planning “seismic” changes to the civil service following last month’s general election victory.

Mr Cummings, a long-standing critic of Whitehall, has in the past said the principle of a permanent civil service was “an idea for the history books”.

In his blog he claimed there were “some profound problems at the core of how the British state makes decisions”.

“We want to improve performance and make me much less important — and within a year largely redundant,” he said.

“At the moment I have to make decisions well outside... my ‘circle of competence’ and we do not have the sort of expertise supporting the PM and ministers that is needed.”

Mr Cummings warned applicants for the post of his personal assistant that they would have to sacrifice nights and weekends to make his life easier.

“Frankly it will hard having a boy/girlfriend at all,” he added. “It will be exhausting but interesting, and if you cut it you will be involved in things at the age of 21 that most people never see.

“I want people who are much brighter than me who can work in an extreme environment.”

In another section aimed at “super-talented weirdos”, he wrote: “We need some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole”.

And after asking applicants to send their CV by email, he warned “I’ll bin you within weeks if you don’t fit — don’t complain later because I made it clear now.”

Mr Cummings ended the post by admitting that his job advert was a “fast and cheap way to get ideas”.

The general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, warned that the plan would threaten the impartiality of the civil service.

Dave Penman said: “Civil servants are recruited on merit, not patronage – a critical principle if they are to provide the best impartial advice to ministers.

“It would be ironic if, in an attempt to bring in radical new thinking, Cummings was to surround himself with like-minded individuals – recruited for what they believe, not what they can do – and less able to provide the robust advice a minister may need, rather than simply the advice they want.”

With 56 years (and counting) of storytelling under its belt, Doctor Who has had its ups and downs as it’s tried to balance classic villains (e.g. Daleks, Cybermen) and new and creative villains amid the many, many adventures of the Doctor and their companion (or companions) in that big blue box. But sometimes all you need is a solid story and great performances to make an iconic foe feel completely refreshing, and as Doctor Who embraced the perks of the spy genre, it had both.

“Spyfall Part 1” ends on a cliffhanger as the Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) is separated from Ryan (Tosin Cole), Yasmin (Mandip Gill), and Graham (Bradley Walsh), who are all stuck on a plane about to crash. The plane has no pilot, was rigged to explode, and there are no parachutes; things look dire for everyone. It seems like a no-win situation, but with the next episode arriving in just a few days, it doesn’t seem impossible to see how it plays out.

BBC America/YouTube

But the biggest shocker of the episode arrives about 10 minutes earlier when O (Sacha Dhawan), the former MI6 employee who was knowledgable in the extraterrestrial, reveals that he’s been the mastermind behind the mystery fueling the episode—as well as the Master himself. And the transformation, now that he no longer needs to hide, is instantaneous and an utter delight.

Whether they’re being played by John Simm, Michelle Gomez, or now Dhawan in the “New Who” era (a.k.a. 2005 onward), the Master knows how to make an entrance. In the case of Dhawan’s Master, he not only made his way into the Doctor’s inner-circle as an expert who might know something about the aliens killing spies around the world, but the infiltration had been in the works for some time. The Master accosted O (who was named as such in MI6 because everything he presented at work was met with an exasperated “Oh”) on his first day of work, took his identity, and worked his way into the Doctor’s good graces; they’re even texting buddies.

“I’ve got a whole shelf over there all about the Doctor,” O tells Graham. “Everything I could gather. A lot of inconsistencies, but it’s very, very interesting.”

It’s a mic-drop for sure. But we were warned by the Doctor, after all, not to trust anyone the moment she and her companions became spies themselves.

The mystery itself involves aliens that the Doctor cannot trace or verify through her sonic screwdriver or the TARDIS. But their presence is enough for C (Stephen Fry in an all-too-brief appearance) to summon the Doctor to MI6 headquarters after several spies from around the world have their DNA changed to something that’s not human. It leads them on the trail of Daniel Barton (Lenny Henry), the CEO of a tech company called Vor that’s like Google on steroids and has more power than several nations.

James Pardon/BBC America

The suspicions swirling around Daniel Barton—who is basically like a Doctor Who version of a Bond villain—gives the Doctor and her companions the chance to live out a spy fantasy complete with gadgets and sneaking into a swanky party. But, as is the case with most spy stories, it turns out that they’re all terrible spies. The initial plan to swipe Barton’s data doesn’t go to plan as Yaz is temporarily sent to the same wired realm the Doctor ends up in later by those mysterious aliens (before she ends up in Australia with the Doctor, Graham, and O) and the Doctor immediately blows her cover at the party to interrogate Barton.

On its own, “Spyfall Part 1” is a wonderfully zany entry back into the Doctor Who universe after a major hiatus away from it. But with the addition of the Master to tie into the bigger picture of season 12, Doctor Who just got a lot more interesting."," Threaten, not specified below",3

36956,c98257f1afe9ee56f923cd3395195297,"PORTAGE, MI — A lawsuit filed against a local Little League board president alleges the president and other board members conspired to cover up inadequate electrical systems at the league’s fields in Portage.

The lawsuit was filed Nov. 5, 2019, in Kalamazoo County Circuit Court by Little League parent and former board member Jay Woodhams, who said he filed the lawsuit on behalf of league families.

In the complaint, Woodhams accuses current league president Joshua Hill of completing electrical work that was not completed to code, and then trying to terminate the league’s safety officer, Dan Corradini, in an alleged attempt to cover it up. The complaint alleges other misconduct as well, such as providing monetary benefits and discounts for board members, incorrectly using executive sessions to suppress votes and intimidating board members with threats of discipline.

Woodhams said he has made past attempts to address the allegations with the board president, and felt a lawsuit was his only remaining option.

“This is the only way to rectify it because there have been so many opportunities to correct it in the past,” he said.

The South Portage Little League is governed by a volunteer board of directors. The lawsuit alleges the league’s president conspired with board members to cover up inadequate electrical systems at the league’s facility on East Centre Avenue in Portage.

Alleged damages include loss of organization revenue from stipends and discounts awarded to Hill and other board members, a declining numbers of volunteers and increased risk of injury to Little League participants, according to court documents.

Woodhams said he is not seeking a specific dollar amount in the lawsuit, but hopes the action will help keep families involved with the league safe. Court documents state that the lawsuit is seeking reform to the organization’s governance, including training courses for volunteers, and seeks restitution to fund the expense. The lawsuit also seeks a review of league finances, damages as determined by that review, the termination of Hill and reimbursement for attorney fees and court costs.

Hill deferred comment to his attorney, Bill Ewald of Braun Kendrick Finkbeiner, based in Saginaw. Despite the lawsuit, Ewald said, Hill still has support from a majority of the board and became the board’s president on his own merits.

“The (lawsuit) was no surprise and there’s no decrease in membership that (Hill) is related to,” Ewald said. “People choose sides and he still has a majority of the board.”

Electrical work at the facility began in late April 2019, according to Woodham’s complaint.

League Safety Officer Dan Corradini asked who would be completing the electrical work, the lawsuit states. Corradini suggested the plans be discussed with the city of Portage, and Hill allegedly said that would not be necessary since the plans had been reviewed by a licensed electrician.

After those issues arose, a board member allegedly found a resignation letter written by Hill and called a meeting, excluding Corradini and other board members, to discuss efforts to prevent his resignation, the lawsuit states.

Meeting discussions led to suggestions to terminate Corradini from his position of safety officer to prevent Hill’s resignation, according to the complaint. Hill did not resign.

The organization did hire an electrician to complete the electrical work a few months after it began, Woodhams said.

Corradini was suspended, pending termination, Woodhams’ complaint states. Corradini appealed the decision, but was terminated at the end of May, according to the lawsuit. Woodhams alleges that termination was improper because not all board members were present for the vote, according to court documents. The decision was ultimately overturned and Corradini is again serving as the league’s safety officer.

The Portage league board secretary, who was not named in the lawsuit and could not be reached for comment on this story, contacted the administrator for Michigan District 2 Little League with concerns, according to Woodhams’ complaint. The administrator noted that the suspension letter to Corradini violated the league constitution and advised the organization to talk with an attorney, the lawsuit states.

At the end of May, the board secretary enlisted the help of Woodhams, who gathered available information and assembled a panel of three qualified, disinterested individuals to help with an assessment, the lawsuit states.

According to court documents, Woodhams sent a “demand to take suitable action” letter to the Board of Directors, which listed allegations of wrongdoing by the president.

On Nov. 27, an answer to the complaint was filed. In it, Hill denies Woodhams had the authority to file a lawsuit on behalf of the organization. Woodhams is not a South Portage Little League board member, the answer states, which raises questions about his role in the lawsuit.

Both parties are now waiting on the court to set a conference before moving forward, Ewald said. At that point, they will be able to move into the discovery phase, and obtain meeting minutes and agendas and written answers from a handful of other board members involved.

“There is nothing going on at the present,” Ewald said. “That is not unusual for lawsuits after we’ve filed the answer to the complaint. Once an order is issued by the court, we can move forward.""

Woodhams said he is handling several aspects of the case on his own due past experience, but said he has also been working with local law firm Kreis Enderle for resources and advice. Woodhams set up an email for local Little League families with questions about the lawsuit. Those interested can send questions to info@southportagelittleleague.com.", Bring lawsuit against ,3

Australia has become an inferno. More than half of the country is choking on smoke, and the skies glow orange as bushfires continue to ravage the continent.

Load Error

Since the start of the bushfire season in September, an estimated 25.5 million acres have burned in Australia, according to Reuters, and at least 25 people have died. More than 1 billion animals are feared dead, and an estimated 2,000 homes have been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate.

The total damage and economic losses will exceed $100 billion, according to Accuweather.

Australia experiences fires every fall, but this year's crisis - which comes on the heels of a heat wave and prolonged drought - is unprecedented. By comparison, the fires that plagued the Brazilian Amazon last year burned 17.5 million acres of rainforest, which is 7 million fewer acres than the impacted area in Australia. (However, most of the Amazon fires were deliberately set by ranchers and loggers looking to clear land, whereas Australia's bushfires mostly started due to natural causes.)

© Copernicus EMS

The fires could be part of an ominous feedback loop: The more land burns, the more carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere, and the more trees - which act as natural carbon sinks - disappear. Already, Australia's fires have released 350 million metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. That's roughly 1% of the total global carbon emissions from 2019.

The more CO2 gets released, the warmer our planet gets; that raises the risk of more big and deadly fires.

© Shayanne Gal/Insider Last year was a year of fire. Blazes cut through 6.4 million acres of the Siberian tundra over the summer, while 2.5 million acres of Alaskan wilderness went up in smoke. More than 100,000 fires started over the course of 10 August days in the Amazon rainforest. But Australia's bushfires dwarf all of those events. In fact, this season obliterates the country's previous record for worst wildfire season; that was in 2009, when the Black Saturday bushfires razed 1.1 million acres.

It's hard to comprehend the size of the affected area in Australia. Added up, the burned land is the size of South Korea or the US state of Virginia.

Compared to the amount of land that burned during California's 2018 wildfire season - its most destructive ever - Australia's acreage total is more than 13 times bigger.

The area of the resulting smoke from the fires - 1.3 billion acres - is equal to the areas of Alaska, Texas, California, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon, Wyoming, and Michigan combined.

© Shayanne Gal/Insider The radius of the resulting smoke - 1.3 billion acres - is equal to the area of Alaska, Texas, California, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon, Wyoming, and Michigan combined.

The plume has reached South America and probably the Antarctic as well, according to the UN World Meteorological Organization.

Major Australian cities like Melbourne and Sydney have been engulfed in orange and yellow haze.

""I looked out into smoke-filled valleys, with only the faintest ghosts of distant ridges and peaks in the background,"" Michael Mann, a US climate scientist who is on sabbatical in Sydney, wrote in the Guardian on January 1.

© Jenny Evans/Getty Images The nearby fires have had a serious impact on the nearby city of Sydney.

In December, a state official said New South Wales was experiencing the ""longest"" and ""most widespread"" period of poor air quality in the state's history.

Dry conditions in Australia's bushland, wooded areas, and Blue Mountain National Park have made the land ripe for sparks. Australia experienced its driest spring ever in 2019. December 18 was the hottest day in the country's history, with average temperatures hitting 105.6 degrees Fahrenheit (40.9 degrees Celsius).

© SAEED KHAN/AFP via Getty Images Experts have pointed out that during catastrophic fire conditions, hazard reduction burns are less effective at controlling the intensity and spread of a fire. Australia issued catastrophic fire condition warnings last week, and weather conditions have been increasingly hot and dry in some areas, exacerbating fire conditions.

In the last 15 years, Australia saw eight of its 10 warmest years on record. Winter rains, which can help reduce the intensity of summer fires, have declined significantly, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. This all meant that when the fire season started, it was savage and unstoppable.

""We used to see hundreds of thousands of hectares burned in bushfires, but now we are seeing millions on fire,"" Pep Canadell, executive director of the Global Carbon Project, told the Herald.

© AAP Image/Julian Smith via REUTERS Even after the fires are out, there is still a lot of work to do.

The more forests burn, the more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, and the more heat it traps on the planet. To make matters worse, when natural carbon sinks like the Amazon rainforest and woodlands in Australia burn down, that reduces the natural avenues by which CO2 can get absorbed.

It's a vicious cycle.

In 2019, wildfires across the globe released approximately 6.38 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to the European Union's satellite observation program, Copernicus. That's about 17% of the global total for the year.

Until now, Australia's annual bushfires were pretty much net-zero in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions - the CO2 they emitted was balanced out by how much carbon-dioxide the country's forests sequestered. But in the last three months, Australia's fires have emitted roughly 350 million metric tons of CO2, according to the Herald. (By comparison, the Amazon fires produced less than half that: 140 million metric tons.)

Between 2013 and 2017, Australia's fires emitted 340 million metric tons of CO2 on average per year. This year's total has already blown past that, and Australia's dry season has another two months to go.

""Normally bushfires are thought of as 'carbon neutral,' but, in very simple terms, we're seeing climate extremes carry a double punch, with more frequent fire and drought,"" David Bowman, a fire-science expert at the University of Tasmania, told the Herald.

© Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty

Canadell said he thinks the country's forests will need 100 years to return to the point where they can act as carbon sinks for fires of this size and scale.

Climate change increases the likelihood, size, and frequency of wildfires, since warmer air sucks away moisture from trees and soil, leading to dryer land. Rising temperatures also make heat waves and droughts more frequent and severe, which exacerbates wildfire risk, since hot, parched forests are prone to burning.

""Climate change is exacerbating every risk factor for more frequent and intense bushfires,"" Dale Dominey-Howes, an expert on disaster risk at the University of Sydney, told Business Insider Australia. ""Widespread drought conditions, higher-than-average temperatures - these are all made worse by climate change.""

On average, Earth has warmed about 1 degree Celsius. July 2019 was the hottest month ever recorded, and 2019 will likely be the third-hottest year on record globally, according to Climate Central. Only 2016, 2015, and 2017 were hotter (in that order).

© AAP Image/Ellen Smith via REUTERS The fires get close to, and sometimes overwhelm, people's homes.

One of the key demands from Brexiters was said to be taking back control from the EU’s supposed “unelected bureaucrats.” In the pre-Christmas election, Boris Johnson secured a comfortable parliamentary majority meaning that the U.K unelected bureaucrats who advise the emboldened Prime Minister are now free to reshape the state to their liking.

This much is clear from a 3000-word blog posting published on January 2 by the Prime Minister’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings. The unelected Cummings has called for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to apply for new jobs within No 10 Downing Street.

This highly unorthodox posting—complete with a non-secure, non-governmental gmail address—admits that the staff hired will be mistreated and “binned” if they fail to be radical enough for Cummings.

His rambling blog calls for project management experts who can work fast, and he pointed to the speed of Myers & Sons, the American road-building contractor—slogan: “Deliver on the impossible”—noted for finishing jobs ahead of schedule.

“If you think you are such a company and you could dual carriageway the A1 north of Newcastle in record time, then get in touch!” exclaimed Cummings.

The A1 connects London and Edinburgh. In England, the road consists of motorway sections and dual carriageways, but in Northumberland and into Scotland, there are many single carriageway stretches.

Making the main road to Scotland into a dual carriageway has been the aim of successive governments down the years, but the high cost of construction for the relatively low number of cars and trucks that currently use the road usually means the plans are eventually shelved.

Cummings wants this sort of cost-benefit analysis to end, and for the road to be “upgraded” for political reasons.

This is just one example of how a government with no immediate prospect of ballot-box accountability will be able to mostly do what it wants. Expect other road-building projects—especially the “zombie” ones that anti-road-building protestors have successfully prevented so far—to be built in the next five years despite much on-the-ground opposition.

Boris Johnson is also in favor of building a road bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland, a mammoth project that most engineers and experts believe cannot or should not be built.

Cummings—described as “joint prime minister” by Lord Adonis, a transport minister in a previous Labour administration—wants to build the same sort of big, bold “impossible” projects favored by Johnson.

The call for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” can be likened to running a major industrialized country like a tech startup, a skunkworks project if you will.

A skunkworks project is one run by a relatively small and loosely structured group of people who research and develop a project primarily for the sake of radical innovation. The term originated during World War II when the P-80 Shooting Star was designed by Lockheed’s Advanced Development Projects Division in Burbank, California.

Cummings has long said he wanted to shake up central government and break up the British civil service’s supposed “Yes, Minister” stranglehold over elected officials. He wrote in the resurrected blog that he wanted to hire “super-talented weirdos” with “genuine cognitive diversity” but avoid senior civil service applicants with Oxford and Cambridge English degrees.

He added: “We need some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole, weirdos from William Gibson novels like that girl hired by Bigend as a brand ‘diviner’ who feels sick at the sight of Tommy Hilfiger or that Chinese-Cuban free runner from a crime family hired by the KGB.”

Yes, these are words written by the man many believe to be the power behind Johnson’s throne.

Cummings is also the “brainiac” who ran the pre-Brexit Vote Leave campaign and created the “take back control” and “£350m for the NHS” slogans.

In his blog posting, he said he wanted to hire people “prepared to take risks to change things a lot.”

The radical changes he would like to see will not be effectively challenged in parliament because the Johnson government has a “significant majority and little need to worry about short-term unpopularity,” wrote Cummings.

Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, a union which represents senior civil servants, warned that Cummings and others advising the Prime Minister are exhibiting a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the modern civil service."," Threaten, not specified below",3

An NDTV report on Thursday night identified the alleged gangster as one Vijay Farmana from Uttar Pradesh. It may be noted that Farmana was arrested on May 17, last year by the Delhi Police’s crime branch. Subsequent investigation led to the emergence of him being involved in a plot to kill a politician in Nagaland.



NDTV reported that the the Home Ministry, taking a serious note of the case, had asked the CBI to take over the probe into the case on July 31.



The CBI's probe revealed Farmana had visited Nagaland earlier with his associates Sharad Pandey and Kapil Chitania in April 2019.



The report added that CBI officials have refused to disclose the identity of the Nagaland politician.

37589,79ae566c4176b36f6b5f62ec77aba20a,"Tens of thousands of thieves are escaping justice with as few as one in 500 thefts being solved by police in parts of Britain, a Telegraph analysis has found.

Home Office data shows that just one in 500 thefts (0.2 per cent) resulted in a charge in Suffolk, the lowest rate, followed by 0.3 per cent in Gloucestershire and City of London and 0.6 per cent in Warwickshire for the year 2018/19.

Even in two of the biggest constabularies in Britain - the Metropolitan Police (0.9 per cent) and Greater Manchester Police (0.9 per cent) - fewer than one in 100 thefts from a person are being solved as stretched officers are forced to prioritise more serious crimes.

Police chiefs admit they are having to “screen out” high-volume, “low harm” crimes such as shoplifting, pickpocketing and other thefts unless there is CCTV, witnesses, forensics or stolen property worth at least £50.

The disclosure comes as The Telegraph can reveal a private security service is mounting the UK’s first private prosecutions for theft and other “minor” crimes because it claims the police have “given up” taking them to court.

The private firm, which provides neighbourhood beat bobbies for residents, firms and shops, is setting up a new prosecution unit after its teams apprehended shoplifters, pickpockets and drug dealers only to be told by police to release them without investigating or charging them.

My Local Bobby, which was set up by former senior Met police officers, already patrols central and north London, funded by local businesses, shops and residents and has mounted its first test case involving a shoplifter whom police refused to prosecute.

It parent company, TM Eye, has previously specialised in private prosecutions for counterfeit and fake goods where it claims 500 convictions and a 100 percent conviction rate since 2013.

Professor Marian Fitzgerald, a criminologist and visiting professor at Kent University, warned that the failure by police to investigate and prosecute such “low harm” crimes was emboldening criminals.

“These people know police are not going to do anything about it and are getting bolder. The risk is that either people buy in security firms if they can afford it or take the law into their own hands. It’s a recipe for disaster,” she said.

The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) said the loss of more than 20,000 police officers since 2010 meant there had been a fall in cases referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and a lower number of people being charged - a trend it aimed to reverse with the extra 20,000 officers pledged by the Government.

“Forces will prioritise cases where there is a realistic prospect of prosecution and in some cases police can, and do, use alternative outcomes like cautions or restorative justice,” said an NPCC spokesman.

“We also ensure that victims who may be particularly vulnerable, such as the isolated elderly, get the support they need.”

The police data shows that since 2014/15, the proportion of personal theft offences resulting in a charge have halved from 2.6 per cent to 1.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2019/20. They account for more than 350,000 offences a year.

The overall figures mask wide variations with the forces at the top of the table achieving charging rates 20 times those at the bottom with Cumbria on 4.3 per cent, Derbyshire 4.7 per cent and Dyfed-Powys on 5.1 per cent.

Simon Kempton, the Police Federation’s lead on operational policing, said the disparities likely reflected the varying priorities of chief police officers, who had to make “hard” decisions on resorucing to ensure victims in high-profile crimes such as child abuse and protection were safeguarded.

“What gets stripped is erroneously called low level crime where no-one is being hurt. There is a temptation to move resources away from that area. That means you are far less likely to identify criminals and far less likely to bring them to justice,” he said.

“That has a knock-on effect on the confidence that people have in the police and our ability to do the job.”

A Home Office spokesman said: “We expect the police to take all crimes seriously. It is the responsibility of Chief Constables and Police and Crime Commissioners to make sure criminal cases are investigated properly and set priorities which reflect the concerns of the people they serve.”

It said it would be recruiting 20,000 extra officers over the next three years “to make sure the police have the resources they need to tackle crime and keep our communities safe. This would include 6,000 by the end of March 2021 across all 43 forces.”

Detective Chief Superintendent Eamonn Bridger, of Suffolk Constabulary, said the apparently low rate could be due to factors including changes in recording processes, evidential difficulties or use of alternative detection outcomes to charging.

“Justice for victims can be achieved by outcomes that are not included in charging figures, these include youth and adult cautions, theft offences that are taken into consideration in addition to principal offences dealt with in court, and those that are dealt with using victim focused outcomes, such as community resolution,” he added.

Victims campaigners warned it would undermine victims’ confidence to report thefts and their trust in the criminal justice system if they thought they would not be investigated.

This week, the Telegraph revealed just one in eight children report thefts because of their belief police will not investigate and fears of reprisals."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Shalynn Hoagland, employed as a medical laboratory technician until October 2019, claims violations of Illinois' Wage Payment and Collection Act. Hoagland filed suit Dec. 16 in St. Clair County Circuit Court against St. Elizabeth's Hospital of the Hospital Sisters of the Third Order in Belleville. She seeks more than $50,000 in damages for an alleged loss of wages from the time she was first employed by the facility in 2014.

""Because this is pending litigation, the hospital cannot comment,"" Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), the parent organization of the nonprofit hospital, told the Record.

According to the lawsuit, the defendant, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, agreed that Hoagland would receive a 30-minute unpaid lunch break and a 15-minute paid break during each shift. Allegedly, the hospital deducted 30 minutes from Hoagland's pay without providing the lunch break.

""In addition, plaintiff (Hoagland) was required to work straight through her shift without getting her 15-minute paid break,"" the lawsuit states.

The hospital's alleged actions are violations of Illinois' Wage Payment and Collection Act, which led to Hoagland's alleged suffering of damages because she was not able to take any lunch break or only a fraction of the time agreed. The defendant is further accused of forcing Hoagland to work through the paid break.

""The issues involved in this litigation are likely to involve considerable attorney time and expense,"" the lawsuit states. ""As such, the damages sustained by the plaintiff coupled with the attorney's fees and cost of litigation are likely to exceed $50,000 in the event the case is tried before the court.""

Al Amiri had accompanied Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to the White House where al-Maliki delivered a joint press conference with former President Obama. Al-Maliki has long been suspected of acting in the interests of Iran.

After the visit, former FBI director Louis Freeh had said it was shocking for al-Amiri to be included in the visit to the White House considering his involvement in the IRGC and its “countless acts of terrorism, which are acts of war against the United States.”

Al Amiri was also suspected of being connected to the deaths of 19 U.S. Air Force personnel killed in the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, the Washington Times reported.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was Chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 2011, said at the time it was “extremely disturbing that the White House would see fit to welcome Al-Amiri to a discussion on the future of Iraq,” the Daily Mail reported.

“If anything, he should be subject to questioning by the FBI and other appropriate U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism agencies,” she added at the time. “The victims of Khobar Towers and the families of thousands of U.S. troops who paid the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq deserve no less.”

The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad was stormed by pro-Iranian protesters early Tuesday, less than two days after the U.S. carried out airstrikes on five sites belonging to the Iran-backed Iraqi militia, Kata’ib Hezbollah.

The protesters set fire to the embassy’s perimeter, smashed windows and doors, and marched and chanted while shouting “death to America” and “down, down America.”

Embassy employees and diplomats were forced to evacuate the location. The U.S. deployed 100 crisis response Marines to reinforce the embassy, along with 750 Army paratroopers to support the region.

The U.S. airstrikes conducted on Dec. 29 came in response after the Kata’ib Hezbollah militia launched a 30+ rocket attack on the K1 military base near Kirkuk, Iraq, which left one U.S. defense contractor dead, and four other U.S. service members injured, according to a Pentagon statement.

The U.S. airstrikes killed 25 militia members and injured 51, and the militia vowed to strike back on the U.S. in revenge.

37688,87f1d96d41841747950bc2c7e2478d86,"The lawsuits allege that six priests sexually abused the victims while they were serving as altar boys or during other church activities.

SAN DIEGO — Content warning: This story describes incidents of sexual abuse which may be disturbing to some readers.

Multiple lawsuits were filed on Thursday against the Catholic Diocese of San Diego and numerous local parishes on behalf of alleged victims of childhood sexual abuse, with recently enacted legislation allowing such legal action even if the alleged abuse occurred outside of the statute of limitations.

The suits allege abuse in the 1960s and 70s by now-deceased priests who operated throughout San Diego County. The victims were previously unable to pursue legal action against the Diocese, but recently enacted AB 218 expands the statute of limitations and opened a three-year window starting this year for victims to file suit.

Attorney Irwin Zalkin said that each time abuse was discovered, priests were simply moved to other parishes where they could continue their behavior, with free access to new victims.

According to Zalkin, the Diocese routinely dealt with the problem of ""bad priests"" by sending them to desert communities, ""where they thought they could hide, where they thought that the people there -- mostly Hispanic -- would not speak up, and they would be out of the limelight, so to speak.""

At a news conference Thursday, 72-year-old Eddie Ortega of Valencia Park opened up about the sexual abuse by a San Diego priest he said he suffered when he was 11 years old.

""The paster of the school molested me three different times,"" Ortega said.

Ortega said the atrocity occurred at St. Jude's Catholic School in Southcrest.

""The molestations were brutal - they were violent,"" said Ortega. ""Anything that you could possibly think of. A rape happened to me by this man Father Sheridan. It was so violent that he made me bleed.""

Father Gregory Sheridan is one of six now-deceased priests who local victims identified in six lawsuits filed against the San Diego Catholic Diocese by Zalkin's office Thursday on behalf of 20 victims. Zalkin said around 60 additional lawsuits are still being prepared and will be filed within the next 60 to 90 days.

""This is only the beginning,"" Zalkin said at Thursday's news conference. ""Now (the victims) have a chance to be heard and to hold this Diocese accountable.""

Four of the 20 plaintiffs in the lawsuits sat next to their boyhood photos during the news conference.

""That's what they looked like when they were sexually abused by priests within this diocese,"" Zalkin said.

Ortega said the suit doesn't change the past but called it a good start.

""Closure doesn't take away the scars and the wounds that we carry,"" he said.

Among the priests targeted in Thursday's lawsuits are:

-- Robert Koerner, who worked out of a parish in Calipatria;

-- Peter Marron, who served in San Diego;

-- Alexander Pinter, who served in Vista;

-- Anthony Rodrigue, who served in La Jolla, Lakeside, Encinitas, Poway and other locations in Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial counties;

-- Joseph Rossell, who served in National City, San Diego, Carlsbad, El Cajon and Oceanside; and

-- Gregory Sheridan, who served in San Diego, Ramona, and Fallbrook.

Kevin C. Eckery, vice chancellor and diocese spokesman, released a statement Thursday decrying the actions of abusive priests and urging victims to contact the church for compensation and counseling, which they can receive whether or not they decide to take legal action.

""Regardless of the legal issues involved, we have a moral obligation to provide assistance to any victim-survivor of that abuse and we would urge their attorney to contact us so that counseling can be arranged at our expense,"" Eckery said. ""There are no prior conditions and the offer of counseling stands regardless of any lawsuit against the diocese. The sexual abuse of minors is evil, regardless of when it happens, but as a result of various reforms in 2002 and earlier, including mandatory Safe Environment training for clergy and all church workers, annual age-appropriate safety training for students in Catholic schools and religious education, enhanced criminal background checks and enhanced awareness and vigilance, no new incidents of abuse have been reported to the diocese in nearly two decades.""

Zalkin said the diocese has offered settlements to the plaintiffs from a victim compensation fund established last fall, but he considered the amounts offered -- around $200,000 each -- ""an insult.""

The worst wildfires to ravage Australia in decades—already blamed for the deaths of at least 17 people—are expected to cause more damage over the weekend, as the country faces soaring temperatures and no rain in sight.

The fires have prompted authorities to announce a state of emergency in New South Wales, where the fires are concentrated, to cope with the dangers expected Saturday. On Thursday, the state’s premier, Gladys Berejiklian, warned in a news conference that many more people would likely have to flee their homes in the next few days. A large “tourist leave zone” has been declared in New South Wales, and according to the BBC, the resulting exodus has been called “the largest relocation out of the region ever.” Thousands already have evacuated from New South Wales and the neighboring state of Victoria this week.

Around 4,000 people in the popular tourist town of Mallacoota, Victoria, sought refuge at the beach on Monday after the fire overtook the town, and the Australian navy began evacuating them on Thursday. Some 800 were being rescued on a naval ship.

Citizens have started to express their frustration with what they see as the government’s inaction. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has faced criticism for suggesting that the fires were a result of “many other factors” besides climate change and insisting that Australia could not have taken any steps to mitigate climate change in a way that would have prevented the current situation. And as conditions in Australia worsened last month, he took his family on a vacation to Hawaii. As Morrison toured one fire-scarred town in New South Wales on Thursday, residents shouted insults at him and demanded better funding for rural fire crews.

The fires, sparked and fed by abnormally hot and arid conditions, began in October and now number more than 200. More than 1,200 homes have been destroyed, and more than 10 million acres have burned. At least 17 people are still missing.

According to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology, this season has been the second driest period on record since 1902, and for the past few years, New South Wales has had below-average rainfall. The heat, too, has been severe: Australia experienced its hottest day on record in mid-December, with an average of 107.4 degrees across the continent. Temperatures are expected to exceed 112 degrees in parts of the country on Friday, according to the bureau. Experts warn that the country may see little relief for weeks or even months, as temperatures usually hit their highs in January and February, when Australia’s peak fire season typically begins.

Meanwhile, 39 American firefighters arrived in Melbourne on Thursday to assist with the efforts. Some 70 additional American and Canadian firefighters are set to arrive next week."," Threaten, not specified below",3

A former employee of Greenleaf Wellness is suing the Sparks-based marijuana business amid allegations of sexual harassment.

In the lawsuit filed Dec. 30, plaintiff Danielle Hardy is accusing Greenleaf Wellness manager and owner Steve Duque of repeatedly touching her inappropriately and using hostile and pejorative language toward women in the workplace.

""Manager Duque, who is a large man, routinely used his gender and physical superiority to intimidate women at work,"" the lawsuit said. ""A number of female employees were openly offended by Manager Duque's openly abusive attitude toward women, but defendant failed to properly investigate and or implement adequate remedial action, sufficient to redress past harassment and deter future harassment.""

Greenleaf Wellness declined to comment on the matter Thursday.

While the lawsuit is against Greenleaf Wellness, Duque is the only staff member named specifically in the six-page lawsuit. Along with several family members and other owners, Duque is partial owner of the business, according to the Nevada Department of Taxation's most recent records. Greenleaf Wellness has licenses for cannabis retail, cultivation, production and distribution.

The Duque family previously ran Castaway Trash Hauling company in Sparks for a decade.

Plaintiff Hardy worked at the Duque family's more recent venture, Greenleaf Wellness, from Nov. 1, 2018 to Jan. 10, 2019 at the dispensary location, according to Hardy's attorney, Mark Mausert. Hardy was fired because of her opposition to the harassment, according to the lawsuit.

Duque on multiple occasions touched Hardy inappropriately, according to the lawsuit.

Duque asked Hardy to call him ""master"" and introduced another female coworker as his ""maid"" and ""lap dog"" at workplace meetings, according to the lawsuit.

The plaintiff refused to reciprocate Duque's sexual advances, according to court documents, and told Duque to keep his hands and sexual comments to himself.

Duque retaliated by firing Hardy, according to the lawsuit.

""Plaintiff suffered emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, fear, loss of sleep and anxiety,"" the lawsuit said.

The plaintiff is seeking unspecified compensation for damages, coverage of attorney fees and an award of punitive damages sufficient to punish and deter the business from condoning future sexual harassment, according to the lawsuit.

The plaintiff is asking that the defendant adopt and ""actually enforce a reasonable policy against sexual harassment and/or retaliation,"" the lawsuit said.

Tehran has vowed ""crushing revenge"" for the killing, saying that the assassination will double motivation to retaliate against the U.S. and Israel.

Iran’s Supreme National Security Council said it has reached a decision on how to respond to the attack, but isn’t saying what the decision is.

>> The four critical questions after the assassination of Iran's Soleimani ■ U.S. takes another step toward war with Iran ■ Overseas Black Ops units await Iran's signal to strike

The council's brief statement after a special session Friday said it investigated “the different aspects of this incident and it is announcing that the United States of America is responsible for all consequences of this criminal adventure.”

Iran’s Supreme National Security Council formulates the country’s military and nuclear program strategy. However, any matter of state is finally decided by the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Iranian UN Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi told the United Nations Security Council and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday in a letter that the killing of Soleimani ""by any measure, is an obvious example of State terrorism and, as a criminal act, constitutes a gross violation of the fundamental principles of international law, including, in particular, those stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.""

Meanwhile, the U.S. is sending some 3,000 troops to the Middle East from the 82nd Airborne Division as a precaution amid rising threats to American forces in the region, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The officials said the troops would be joining the roughly 750 forces that were sent to Kuwait earlier this week.

At a press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump said ""we took action last night to stop a war, not to start a war.""

He told journalists at Mar a Lago that ""the world is better without the monsters"" who were killed last night, and that he doesn't want war with Iran, saying: ""We do not seek regime change in Iran.""

The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iran-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, Iraqi officials said.

Following the attack, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad urged all citizens to depart Iraq immediately.

""At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qassem Soleimani,"" the Pentagon said in a statement. ""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,"" it added.

""Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack U.S. diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,"" read the Pentagon statement.

According to Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Washington had ""clear, unambiguous"" intelligence that Soleimani was planning a significant campaign of violence against the United States when it decided to strike him, and warned Soleimani's plots ""might still happen.""

Speaking to a small group of reporters at his Pentagon office, Milley told a small group of reporters ""we fully comprehend the strategic consequences"" associated with the strike against Soleimani, but he said the risk of inaction exceeded the risk that killing him might dramatically escalate tensions with Tehran.

""Is there risk? Damn right, there's risk. But we're working to mitigate it,"" Milley said from his Pentagon office.

Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2020

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a video of Iraqis allegedly ""dancing in the street for freedom; thankful that General Soleimani is no more,"" following the assasination.

Later on Friday, in interviews on Fox News and CNN, Pompeo said the strike which killed Soleimani sought to disrupt ""an imminent attack,"" but declined to discuss many details of the alleged threat.

He said it was ""an intelligence-based assessment"" that drove the U.S. decision to target Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force.

""These were threats that were located in the region,"" Pompeo added. ""Last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack ... was disrupted.""

Soleimani was ""actively plotting"" actions that ""would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk,"" Pompeo told CNN, echoing the Pentagon statement earlier on Thursday.

""What was sitting before us was his travels throughout the region, his efforts to make a significant strike against Americans,"" Pompeo said separately on Fox News. ""There would have been many Muslims killed as well, Iraqis and people in other countries.""

Earlier, Trump took to Twitter to claim that ""Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!,"" seemingly suggesting a tough stance on Tehran is more effective. He added Soleimani was ""directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number of protesters killed in Iran itself.""

In what may have been an indirect response to Trump's tweet, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday there are Americans and Europeans who owe their lives to Soleimani because of his efforts to defeat the Islamic State group.

Araghchi tweeted that the “American people would one day know how many lives General Soleimani has saved - including Americans and Europeans - by defeating Daesh (ISIS) in the Middle East.”

The senior diplomat suggested the plans in Washington were political, saying in his tweet that “Such reelection (mis)calculations will certainly lead to disaster.”

The assassinations are a potential turning point in the Middle East and are expected to draw severe retaliation from Iran and the forces it backs in the Middle East against Israel and American interests.

Soleimani is considered the main figure leading Iran's operations in the Middle East, and Israel has accused him for years of instigating terror in the region and held him responsible for killings of Israelis.

According to Iraqi reports, the assassination was carried out during a decoy airstrike in which rockets were fired at the Baghdad International Airport, while American helicopters were tracking Soleimani and al-Muhandi.

A high-level Iraqi security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis had arrived to the airport in a convoy to receive Soleimani whose plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria. The airstrike occurred as soon as he descended from the plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and his companions, killing them all.

The attack came amid tensions with the United States after a New Year's Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The two-day embassy attack which ended Wednesday prompted President Donald Trump to order about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East.

'Crushing revenge'

Iranian Supreme Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Friday the assassination of Soleimani would double the motivation of the resistance against the United States and Israel, state television reported.

""All enemies should know that the jihad of resistance will continue with a doubled motivation, and a definite victory awaits the fighters in the holy war,"" Khamenei said in a televised statement, in which he called for three days of national mourning.

""Soleimani's martyrdom will make Iran more decisive to resist America's expansionism and to defend our Islamic values,"" Iranian President Hassan Rohani said in a statement on Friday. ""With no doubt, Iran and other freedom-seeking countries in the region will take his revenge.""

Iranian Defense Minister Amir Hatami said ""A crushing revenge will be taken for Soleimani's unjust assassination ... We will take revenge on all those involved and responsible for his assassination,"" according to state news agency IRNA.

""The brutality and stupidity of American terrorist forces in assassinating Commander Soleimani ... will undoubtedly make the tree of resistance in the region and the world more prosperous,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a statement.

Zarif also took to twitter earlier and said the assassination was ""an extremely dangerous and foolish escalation. The U.S. bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.""

During an interview Iranian state television, Zarif said the strike ""was clearly a terrorist action ... Iran will launch various legal measures at the international level to hold America to account for Soleimani's assassination.""

Islamic Jihad has issued a message mourning Soleimani's death, saying his assassination reflects U.S. crimes and its ongoing support for Israel and the occupation.

Muhammad Alhand, an Islamic Jihad official in Gaza, also said: ""The U.S. administration and President Trump prove to be working for Israel. They live in the illusion that this assassination and the removal of Soleimani are creating an opportunity for strategic change for the benefit of the U.S., Israel, and their allies in the region, but this will be an opportunity to change the trend and actions against the U.S. and Israeli intervention and expansion in the Middle East.""

Deputy Secretary-General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine Abu Ahmed Fouad also said ""Soleimani is a popular commander who did not abandon the territory and supported the resistance movements in Palestine, Lebanon and Yemen."" Adding that ""the U.S. opened the gates of hell with his assassination.""

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said that ""Honored supreme commander of Islam Soleimani was martyred in attack by U.S. helicopters,"" Iran state media reported.

Iran's top security body will meet on Friday to discuss the ""criminal"" attack that killed Soleimani, its spokesman was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency.

""In the next few hours, an extraordinary meeting of the Supreme National Security Council will be held to probe the criminal act of attack on commander Soleimani's car in Baghdad, which led to his martyrdom,"" spokesman Keyvan Khosravi said.

Israel braces for a response

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his trip to Greece and returned to Israel Friday afternoon. Before boarding the plane in Greece, he told reporters that the the U.S. has a right to defend itself and praised Trump for acting ""swiftly, forcefully and decisively.""

Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett met with the top army brass, including Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi and senior security officials, for a security assessment Friday morning at the military headquarters in Tel Aviv. Following the assessment, the army decided not to make changes to their routine or border defenses at this time.

Israel Army Radio however said the military had gone on heightened alert. Israel also raised its security alert level at its diplomatic missions overseas.

The Israeli army decided to close Mount Hermon to visitors on Friday. No other instructions were given to citizens living in the north of the country.

The U.S. State Department said Pompeo spoke with Iraq's Speaker of Parliament Mohammed al-Halbousi on Friday and they agreed on the need to lower tensions in Iraq and the region in the wake the strike.

""The secretary expressed his appreciation for al-Halbousi's continued partnership with the United States,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. ""Secretary Pompeo and Speaker al-Halbousi agreed on the importance of reducing tensions in Iraq and the region.""

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia called on Friday for self-restraint to prevent escalation after the strike, an official source told state TV.

Also, the ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement affirming the international community must fulfil its responsibilities to ensure the security of the region.

French President Emmanuel Macron also said that Iran should refrain from any provocation, adding in his statement that he had held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the situation in Iraq.

'The game has changed'

Soleimani survived several assassination attempts against him by Western, Israeli and Arab agencies over the past two decades.

Previous U.S. reports said Israel had attempted to assassinate Soleimani in 2008, when Hezbollah International Operations Chief Imad Mughniyeh was assassinated in a joint operation by the CIA and the Mossad. Eventually, the Americans decided not to kill Soleimani.

The attack on Soleimani on Friday came amid tensions with the United States after a New Year's Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The two-day embassy attack which ended Wednesday prompted President Donald Trump to order about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East.

The breach at the embassy followed U.S. airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The U.S. military said the strikes were in retaliation for last week’s killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that the U.S. blamed on the militia.

U.S. officials have suggested they were prepared to engage in further retaliatory attacks in Iraq.

“The game has changed,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday, telling reporters that violent acts by Iran-backed Shiite militias in Iraq — including the rocket attack on December 27 that killed one American — will be met with U.S. military force.

He said the Iraqi government has fallen short of its obligation to defend its American partner in the attack on the U.S. embassy.

The developments also represent a major downturn in Iraq-U.S. relations that could further undermine U.S. influence in the region and American troops in Iraq and weaken Washington’s hand in its pressure campaign against Iran."," Physically assault, not specified below",3
37983,b31cfcd26eb403e4ee54d9b6dbd32641,"We keep wishing peace and happiness at every New Year. In hindsight, it appears wishful thinking, doesn’t it? The underlying truth is that since time immemorial, the desired peace and happiness have been eluding us. The past has not been peaceful. The reason: There are forces which work against peace and happiness. Power hungry leaders, nations, arms dealers and their terrorist agents are among those peace destroyers. They are a nexus: One feeds on another.



The flames of war would have long flickered out if only nations had behaved well and suppressed their hunger for the type of power that they wanted to dominate the other countries and plunder their wealth. But they pursue power and more power, bringing upon misery on hundreds of millions of innocent people. Their principle seems to be live and let die. They live while others die for them.

The television visuals of wounded children are far too many. They no longer make us cry. To the much glee of power hungry nations, agents of war and terrorists, we have been desensitised to the suffering of the people caught up in the conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Palestine and many other places. There is no proper count of how many have died in conflicts created by power-hungry nations. According to a Brown University study, more than 500,000 people have died in the United States’ wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan by October 2018. But other studies say the death toll is more than 1.4 million

in Iraq alone.



Since the past has not been peaceful, the law of average injects pessimism into 2020. For the new year to be peaceful, power politics should end and the arms industry should roll up its business strategy of creating conflicts and bogeys to sell weapons. Of course, power hungry nations and the arms industry should stop their sponsorship of terrorism.

It is too naïve to believe that terrorism is self-generated. Terrorism is created. In some cases, social injustice and the absence of an upright judicial mechanism at domestic level to right the wrongs may entice angry and frustrated youths to take up arms. But there are international vultures which swoop on trouble spots to further their global agendas. The terrorism that bled Sri Lanka dry economically, socially and psychologically for three long decades had its foreign sponsors.



The type of terrorism the world is now grappling with also did not erupt in a vacuum. It was created. Be it al-Qaeda or the Islamic State (IS), the big powers had a hand in the birth of such terrorist groups. They arm, train and fund terrorist organisations to achieve their geopolitical ends.

Agree, the United States killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011 and IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last year. But the killings of these terror leaders do not absolve the world’s number one military power of the crime of aiding and abetting their terrorism. The US had hailed al-Qaeda members as freedom fighters when they were fighting Washington’s war in Afghanistan against its cold war enemy the Soviet Union. Al-Qaeda received US weapons and money to fight the Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan.



Although, al-Qaeda later turned an enemy of the US and attacked US targets such as the war ship USS Cole in the seas off Yemen in 2000 and the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in September 2001, these attacks, in hindsight, appeared to have unfolded according to a script that was prepared to pave the way for the US to achieve its geostrategic objective of expanding its military dominance not only in West Asia, but also in the Russian backyard of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Perhaps, al Qaeda leader bin Laden was hunted down and killed because his handlers feared he could one day spill the beans.



In the aftermath of the killing of IS leader al-Baghdadi, questions were raised in the social media whether he was killed because he also could one day expose who he really was and how he was handled by powerful intelligence outfits. Killing the people who know a lot of secret is an old practice intelligence outfits adhere to, especially if such persons have outlived their usefulness.

In the John F Kennedy assassination, the one who killed Kennedy was killed by another assassin, who also died mysteriously while in prison. Recently, American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in one of the hi-tech tight security US prisons. With him, it is said, died many dirty secrets of world leaders, with whom he had close ties.

Whatever it is, IS leader al-Baghdadi would not have come into the scene, if the US had not invaded Iraq and later become an accomplice with some regional powers to kindle the flames of war in Syria.



As we welcomed the New Year, terrorism watchers warned that IS was gearing up to re-emerge much stronger in Iraq than it had been under al-Baghdadi. Iran which played a key role in defeating the IS in Iraq was livid this week, when the US killed 25 members of an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia group that was in the forefront of the war against the IS. The US says it launched the attack because of a rocket attack that killed a US contractor in a US base in Iraq.

Attacking a group that fights the IS could mean the US is supporting the IS. In Syria, too, Iranian troop positions were targeted by Israel with US blessings. Often Israeli attacks had taken place when the Iranian forces were taking on IS terrorists.

If these examples are not enough to show that the US and its allies were doing the wrong thing to deny the world the much needed peace, then there is also Palestine where the US and Israeli actions, especially US President Donald Trump’s preposterous acts, have killed even the remotest chance for peace. These acts include the Trump administration’s recognition of the whole of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and the declaration that Israel’s illegal settlement building activities in occupied Palestinian territory are legal.

International politics is largely a struggle for power. In this power struggle, people are disposable while their right to life is extremely violable. As long as power politics drives the world order, the old year will give way to a new year without making peace a reality."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen urged China to co-exist with a sovereign Taiwan and warned the world that “One Country, Two Systems” – the policy that applies to Hong Kong and Beijing has attempted to impose on Taiwan – is simply not viable in remarks Wednesday.

Tsai’s New Year’s Day speech acknowledged tensions with China in anticipation of the island nation’s presidential election on January 11. It occurred shortly before the head of the nation’s military, Chief of General Staff Shen Yi-ming, died along with several other senior military officials in a Black Hawk helicopter crash of unknown cause.

Tsai’s government recently passed a law to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from meddling in the upcoming elections after months of threats of violence from dictator Xi Jinping.

“China must face the reality of the Republic of China’s existence, … respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy, and handle cross-strait differences peacefully, on a basis of equality,” Tsai said on Wednesday, urging the Communist Party to stop seeing Taiwan as a rogue province. According to the Taipei Times, Tsai insisted that “China must recognize the existence of the Republic of China; respect the values of democracy and freedom Taiwan’s 23 million people hold dear; resolve cross-strait differences in a peaceful and equitable manner; and engage in negotiations with the government of Taiwan or an institution with a mandate from the government”:

In 2019, the price of gold bullion surged to its highest rate in six years.

Unfortunately, the rise in the price of gold has triggered a comparable increase in the level of illegal mining, human rights abuses and environmental destruction.

From the Amazon to sub-Saharan Africa, drug trafficking and organized crime connected to gold prospecting are on the rise. Gold-producing regions often suffer from weak governing bodies and scant oversight, which means lax protections for workers, environmental degradation and local corruption.

Professor Mark Pieth joined the Altamar podcast team of Peter Schechter and Muni Jensen to shed light on the industry’s intricate network of miners, bankers, traffickers and enablers — and how to clean up the supply chain. Mr. Pieth is the head of Basel University’s Institute on Governance, a research and policy institute he founded that explores methods to challenge abuses of power in international settings and the private sector.

Mr. Pieth is also a professor of criminal law and criminology at Basel and was previously an international and national regulator, defense lawyer and judge. He is the author of a recent book on the gold industry, Gold Laundering: The Dirty Secrets of the Gold Trade and How to Clean Up.

The Illicit Trade

As Mr. Pieth explains, things quickly become complicated when talking about the illicit gold market: “The actual problem is, you have illegal, really organized crime or warlords controlling the gold market … you have lots of informal — let’s say simply not officially registered — miners.”

On both large and small scales, miners are considered illegal when they fail to get proper permits, work in environmentally protected areas, fail to pay taxes or employ workers under the table without contracts. And illegally mined gold commands a serious share of the market. In the case of Latin America, for example, experts estimate that one-third of the region’s exported gold is mined illegally.

Altamar podcast: Mr. Pieth explains how illegal drug money has become mixed up with illegal gold production.

The Social and Environmental Cost

The cost to local communities is often devastating. When mining for gold, mercury is mixed with the precious metal to help remove any natural impurities. The two elements react and emit noxious fumes into the air, while leftover mercury seeps into soil and local waterways. Exposure has been linked to cancer, neurological damage, shock — and even death.

According to Mr. Pieth, violence tends to closely follow gold mining productions, resulting in “a whole plethora of different human rights problems.” In many countries, cartels with massive earnings from the illegal drug trade buy gold to further diversify their profit portfolios.

In terms of organized crime, “Colombia is at the forefront at the moment where the peace process has actually created a lot of so-called ‘bandas criminales,’ criminal gangs, and if you talk about conflict, it’s enough to go to Darfur in Sudan. You have lots and lots of people being killed over fights over gold.”

What Regulation Is in Place?

Ultimately, Mr. Pieth argues that pursuing binding legal standards will help ensure that more gold is produced ethically worldwide.

The OECD, for example, has a legal framework to safeguard against malpractice in the gold industry. The problem is that it’s completely voluntary: “These rules are not really taking root; they’re not really translated because the people, the independent evaluators who should secure the whole system, they’re not up to it … governments are very slow to do something very meaningful because they’re trying to protect their economic interests.”

Altamar podcast: Mr. Pieth explains why voluntary regulation is not enough.

One of the challenges is that it is hard to trace where most gold comes from. The blood diamond campaign was successful in helping to stop illegal diamond production. So is there anything to learn from the blood diamond campaign that the gold mining industry can adopt?

Altamar podcast: Mr. Pieth explains that consumer awareness is key, but that it is harder to trace gold back to its source.

Although one might expect large-scale, industrial gold mining to face more stringent regulations, Mr. Pieth says that there’s often little oversight there as well: “You frequently have a kind of land grabbing; you have expropriation without adequate remuneration of indigenous populations, or you have toxic waste … and you have, as a consequence of all that, conflict with local communities.”

38229,fd179d3cf5223c03c2f6d8401febecc6,"Bushfire season has destroyed the homes of millions of native animals. Here's how you can do your bit to help them.

Millions of animals are dead and hundreds of thousands more will perish over coming days as a result of killer bushfires terrorising southeast Australia.

Native wildlife and agricultural livestock are among the fatalities, with already-endangered species at greater risk of extinction.

The extent of the carnage may never be known.

“The fires will have killed millions of animals ... mammals, birds, reptiles,” Wildlife Victoria boss Megan Davidson said.

READ MORE: Half a billion animals perish in bushfires

And the threat is not over, with wildlife rescue groups likely to be helpless in many instances.

“It is largely a job of euthanasing at this stage, both livestock and wildlife,” Dr Davidson said.

“They are so severely burned that there is nothing better you can do than end their suffering.”

Revelations by University of Sydney ecologist Chris Dickman earlier this week that bushfires are likely to have killed almost 500 million animals since September made global headlines.

This morning Professor Dickman released a new statement stressing that number was extremely conservative and the true toll was likely to be far higher.

“This figure only relates to the state of NSW,” he said.

“Many of the affected animals are likely to have been killed directly by the fires, with others succumbing later due to the depletion of food and shelter resources and predation from introduced feral cats and red foxes.

“The figure includes mammals, birds and reptiles and does not include insects, bats or frogs. The true loss of animal life is likely to be much higher than 480 million.”

In coming days more animals will die from starvation and heat stress as they battle to find food and shelter in their decimated habitat.

The nationally-endangered eastern bristlebird is one species of concern amid the fires which are straddling the NSW-Victorian border.

“There are only three populations in Australia and two are under threat,” The University of Melbourne’s Alan York said.

One of the small birds’ habitats is near Jervis Bay on the NSW south coast and the other is Mallacoota in Victoria’s East Gippsland, where fires forced people on to the beach to escape flames.

“It is a bird with very limited flight capabilities so it’s very difficult for it to get out of the way of fire,” Prof York said.

The eastern bristlebird’s other habitat on the Gold Coast has also faced struggles in recent times but is not currently under threat from fire.

Despite the scale of destruction caused by the fires, both Prof York and Dr Davidson were hopeful that animal populations could recover.

“People get worried that species will become extinct but it’s more about population size and they will return,” he said.

“It is sometimes surprising how quickly things will recover - as soon as conditions are good again they can very rapidly breed up.”

Professor Davidson said everyone could help animals that were not only suffering from fires but from years of drought.

“It’s grim, but we don’t want people to despair.”

HOW TO HELP THIRSTY WILDLIFE

* Distribute containers of water outdoors, being sure to throw in some sticks and leaves so that insects have something to cling to

* Swimming pool owners should add “climb-out points” so animals don’t drown

* Fruit tree owners should remove netting to share their produce

* When offering pellets and hay, be sure to spread the food out so that species have a lesser chance of being targeted by predators"," Threaten, not specified below",3

Providing adequate safe water and improving sanitation is key to ending recurrent outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases that include typhoid, cholera and common diarrhoea in Harare’s western suburbs.

Harare has for years been struggling to end diarrhoeal outbreaks, particularly in Glen View and Budiriro which are said to be the lowest points of the city.

As a result, waste and pollutants from other areas flow to this area, resulting in contamination of underground water, leading to recurrent outbreaks of the diarrhoeal diseases.

It is thought that the contractor who did the initial layout of water and sewer reticulation systems did a shoddy job back in the 1980s, resulting in frequent pipe bursts.

Another school of thought says since Glen View is close to Churu Farm, housing nearly 4 000 squatter settlers relying largely on pit latrines, the possibility of contamination of underground water through seepage cannot be ruled out.

Harare’s chief planner Mr Samuel Nyabeze ruled out the last assertion, arguing that Glen View and Churu Farm were two different places.

“Glen View is a formal settlement while the latter is an informal settlement invaded by different individuals and cooperatives,” he said.

“The cause of recurrent water-borne disease outbreaks in Glen View is really an issue of water and sewer infrastructure.”

Mr Nyabeze said the continuous contamination of borehole water by sewage in the area was because of its geographical set up.

“Boreholes in Glen View and Budiriro are repeatedly contaminated with sewage because they are at the lowest point of Harare, according to the geographical set up,” he said.

Mr Nyabeze said as a result, all industrial waste came to this area and possibility of contamination of underground water through seepage was high.

Responding to concerns on poor solid waste disposal, cited by public health experts as one of the major causes of contamination of drinking water, the city’s works director Engineer Zvenyika Chawatama said:

“We have been carrying out our duty in terms of waste disposal in areas that include Glen View.

“However, efforts to urgently attend to bursts are being hampered by lack of adequate equipment and unavailability of fuel.”

Disease and epidemiology control director in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Dr Portia Manangazira said while Government rolled out cholera and typhoid vaccines last year to protect residents against water-borne diseases, improving the city’s water and sanitation remained critical.

“The local authorities should, therefore, know better and be compliant to provisions of the Public Health Act which mandates them to provide adequate safe water and sanitation to all residents in the cities or towns,” she said.

“This is the golden standard — primary prevention — for prevention of these diseases, vaccines being secondary and outbreak response being tertiary level and much less effective with the regrettable loss of lives we have witnessed in Harare.”

Harare City Council has of late been recording sporadic cases of suspected typhoid in Glen View.

The city’s health director Dr Prosper Chonzi said all recorded suspected patients were never vaccinated against either cholera or typhoid.

About 60 percent of the targeted population received vaccination against typhoid.

Most suburbs in Harare and surrounding towns continue to experience intermittent water supplies, forcing residents to rely on boreholes, which are in some cases contaminated, shallow wells and open water sources.

In addition, most of the sewer and water infrastructure is old and now characterised by bursts, some of which take time before they are attended to, leaving room for contamination of drinking water."," Threaten, not specified below",3

But with the climate expected to continue to warm, more records could be broken, experts have warned.

The Met Office said on Friday that the 10 years from 2010 to 2019 had been the second warmest and second wettest decade in the country over the past 100 years, slightly behind 2000 to 2009.

The 2010s also saw the highest UK daily maximum temperature records set for February, July, October, November and provisionally for December, it added. (PA Graphics)

Further records for highest daily minimum temperature were set for January, February and April between 2010 and 2019.

This compared to just one low-temperature record during this decade, with the Beast from the East in 2018 leading to the coldest March day on record with a maximum temperature of -4.7C recorded at Tredegar in South Wales.

Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the National Climate Information Centre, said: “It is notable how many of these extreme records have been set in the most recent decade and how many more of them are reflecting high rather than low-temperature extremes: a consequence of our warming climate.”

He warned that with the warming trend in the UK expected to continue, this could see more records broken.

He added: “We are expecting the warming trend to continue through the 21st century and we would expect these sorts of records subsequently to be broken in the future.”

A spokesman for the Government said that climate change was a “national priority” and it is committed to increasing the momentum around environmental action.

The Met Office said that 2019 was provisionally the 11th warmest year on record, with a mean average temperature of 9.42C.

This puts it just outside the top 10, which have all occurred since 2002, the Met Office said.

Last year four highest temperature records were set, including the highest winter and summer temperatures and, pending verification, a potential new December maximum of 18.7C recorded on December 28. (PA Graphics)

The year has also been the 11th wettest year on record, with mean average rainfall of 1,240.1mm. The highest mean average rainfall was 1,337.3 in 2000.

Some counties in central and eastern England such as Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire and parts of south Yorkshire, which saw heavy rainfall through summer and autumn, have had annual rainfall figures in the top five, the Met Office said.

Dr McCarthy said the UK can expect wetter winters and drier summers in the future.

He added: “We have observed a general increase in rainfall in recent decades but that’s not evenly distributed so not everyone in the country has experienced this.

“We are expecting to see an increase in winter rainfall, so wetter winters and drier summers – but we could still experience some dry winters and wet summers.”

A Government spokesman said: “Tackling climate change is a national priority and we are determined to address it.

“We were the first major economy to set out a legally binding target to eliminate our contribution to climate change by 2050, and are the fastest in the G20 to decarbonise since 2000.

“Since 1990, we have reduced our emissions by over 40% while growing the economy by over two thirds.

The 19-year-old faces up to a year in prison after she was found guilty of 'public mischief' over her claim that 12 Israeli men gang-raped her in Ayia Napa.

Lawyers and campaigners have raised doubts about the verdict after the teenager, who intends to appeal, said she was forced to sign a retraction statement by Cypriot police.

The Foreign Office says the UK is 'seriously concerned' about the fairness of the woman's trial and it is understood officials have raised the 'deeply distressing case' with the Cypriot authorities.

Speaking to The Sun, the British woman called on the PM and foreign secretary Dominic Raab to intervene personally.

'Every second of this ordeal has been a waking nightmare,' she said.

'I would say to both the Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister, both of whom are fathers, please support me with your actions, not just with your words. Time is running out for me. Please, please help.'

The woman has been on bail since the end of August, after spending a month in prison, and could face up to a year in jail and a €1,700 euro £1,500 fine when she is sentenced on January 7.

The teenager's mother has said she would 'definitely' like Mr Raab to intervene in the case.

She told BBC Radio 4 earlier this week: 'I would love the Foreign Secretary to get involved, that would be fantastic.'

The mother said they will be appealing against the verdict 'without question' and hoped the FCO could help them progress the case to the Cypriot Supreme Court.

A number of prominent legal figures in Cyprus have written to attorney general Costas Clerides urging him to intervene in the case.

But the government of Cyprus has said it has 'full confidence in the justice system and the courts'.

The attorney general said on Tuesday that he could not suspend the trial because she had levelled 'grave accusations' against police investigators that had to be adjudicated in court.

Judge Michalis Papathanasiou said he believed the woman had made false allegations because she felt 'embarrassed' after realising she had been filmed having sex in a video found on some of the Israelis' mobile phones.

The annual total soared by nearly a fifth, from 11.6 million hours in 2016 to 13.7 million hours in 2018 amid rising concern over a string of missed key waiting times targets.

Sacramento, Calif., (CNA) - A three-year window opened in California Wednesday, allowing lawsuits over childhood sexual abuse that would normally be impeded by the state's statute of limitations.

The window was created when California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed AB 218 into law in October. In addition to the window, the bill also permanently adjusted the state's statute of limitations for civil suits regarding childhood sexual abuse.

Previously, a person had until the age of 26, or three years after discovering damages from sexual abuse, to file a claim. The state now allows plaintiffs to file lawsuits until the age of 40, or five years after discovering damage.

The California Catholic Conference said in a statement released at the bill's signing that the state's bishops hoped AB 218 would be a positive step for increased healing of all survivors of child sexual abuse.

""Ultimately, our hope is that all victim-survivors of childhood sexual abuse in all institutional settings will be able to have their pain and suffering addressed and resolved and so our prayers are that AB 218 will be a step forward in that direction,"" said Andy Rivas, executive director of the conference, in October.

Rivas called the history of sexual abuse in the Church as a ""legacy of shame"" and that ""we are aware nothing can undo the violence done to victim-survivors or restore the innocence and trust that was taken from them.""

In 2003, California had a similar window that allowed survivors of childhood sexual abuse to file claims. At that time, the Church paid more than $1.2 billion to survivors of childhood abuse.

No details have yet been made available regarding the number of suits that were filed on the opening day of the window. At the time the bill was signed, one attorney said that he had approximately 100 people who were ready to file lawsuits against various institutions in California, including schools, dioceses, foster homes, and the Boy Scouts.

In New York, approximately 400 lawsuits were filed on the first day of a window allowing a one-year suspension of the statute of limitations. These claims included a RICO suit against the Diocese of Buffalo and the Northeast Province of Jesuits, who are based in New York.

Other states have also expanded or changed the statute of limitations related to child sexual abuse. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy (D) signed a law in May that raised the age limit to file a claim from 20 to 55, or seven years after the discovery of damages, whichever is later.

Security officials in Zacatecas state said four other prisoners were injured in the latest riot at the Cieneguillas prison, where 16 prisoners died on Tuesday.

The Public Safety Department said the prison had been brought back under control. Zacatecas state security secretary Ismael Camberos Hernández told the Milenio television station that inmates angry over the Tuesday riot had attacked prisoners they accused of betraying them that day.

He said the prisoner had been battered to death by fellow prisoners who detached a metal cell door and bashed him with it. The four wounded Thursday also suffered injuries from blows.

But in Tuesday’s riot, authorities confiscated four guns that they believe were smuggled in during visiting hours. Prison guards were placed under investigation after the riot.

Not all of the victims in Tuesday’s riot died from gunshot wounds. Some were stabbed and others beaten with objects. No guards or police were wounded.

Local media reported the prison held members of various gangs and cartels, including the Sinaloa cartel and the Gulf and Northeast cartels.

Such killings frequently involve score settling between rival cartel members or a battle for control of the prison’s illicit business.

Mexico has a long history of deadly prison clashes. In October, six inmates were killed in a prison in Morelos state.

In September, Nuevo Leon state closed the infamous Topo Chico prison, the site of many murders over the years. In February 2016, 49 prisoners died there during rioting when two factions of the Zetas cartel clashed."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

The US aviation regulator Federal Aviation Administration has issued an advisory to all air carriers and commercial operators against flying into or crossing the Pakistan airspace citing ""extremist/militant activity"".

""There continues to be a risk to US civil aviation from attacks against airports and aircraft, particularly for aircraft on the ground and aircraft operating at low altitudes, including during the arrival and departure phases of the flight,"" reads the advisory.

""The ongoing presence of extremist/militant elements operating in Pakistan poses a continued risk to US civil aviation from small-arms fire, complex attacks against airports, indirect weapons fire, and anti-aircraft fire, any of which could occur with little or no warning,"" it said.

In justification to the advisory, the FAA also makes mention of the Balakot airstrike by the IAF and the subsequent capturing of Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman by Pakistan in February last year, besides escalating tensions between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue.

The regulator added that pilots or airlines must report safety or security incidents - which may happen in Pakistan - to the FAA. Pakistan on July 16 last year opened its airspace for India after about five months of restrictions imposed in the wake of a standoff with New Delhi.

Following the Balakot airstrikes by the Indian Air Force, Pakistan had closed its airspace on February 26 last year.

38884,3cf9176a9cca87d9b5e77464f1154a5f,"China’s decision to suspend a link between the Shanghai and London stock exchanges is less a blow for markets than a warning shot to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he readies the United Kingdom for Brexit.

According to people familiar with the matter, the Chinese government has temporarily halted the Shanghai-London Stock Connect on political grounds. One person said that Britain’s stance on the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is one of the issues that prompted the move, and that how relations with the U.K. proceed will determine whether the link is restored.

The timing is unlikely to be a coincidence, as Johnson seeks to strengthen trading ties with China after the U.K. leaves the European Union this month, and with a decision looming on whether to allow Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co. to play a role in future British broadband networks.

Though the link between the two exchanges — designed to allow companies listed on one venue to issue shares on the other — has so far underwhelmed, its suspension is the latest indication of how ties have deteriorated.

“This break is pretty symbolic because the reality is our business practices do not align,” said Tom Tugendhat, a ruling Conservative lawmaker who chaired the House of Commons foreign affairs committee in the last Parliament. “China’s political response really speaks to a growing reality — their economic model is not aligned to a free market based on the rule of law.”

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said he’s “not aware of the specifics” of the stock exchange case. “I would just like to stress that we hope the U.K. will provide a fair and just and open, non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses to invest there,” he told reporters in Beijing on Thursday. “We hope it will create fair conditions for practical co-operation between the two countries.”

The China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Shanghai Stock Exchange did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while representatives for the London Stock Exchange and U.K. Treasury declined to comment.

“China has a fairly extensive track record in putting up informal barriers to trade or harming business relations as a way for the Chinese government to wield more influence over other governments,” said William Nee, a business and human rights analyst at Amnesty International’s Hong Kong office. “Beijing has been particularly sensitive to criticism of its conduct in Hong Kong.”

The U.K.-China relationship is now a far cry from the “golden era” imagined by former prime minister David Cameron, who wanted to reboot ties to Beijing via trade and investment. Tensions over the disputed South China Sea have played a part, but it’s events in the former British colony of Hong Kong that have done the most damage.

The two sides have been engaged in a prolonged spat over Beijing’s handling of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which the U.K. returned to Chinese rule in 1997 on the agreement that the territory’s independent courts, capitalist system and democratic institutions would be maintained.

Despite calls from the protesters to intervene more, the British government initially limited itself to demands for authorities to show restraint and urging dialogue to defuse tensions — though even these interventions triggered an angry response from Beijing.

But Johnson’s government raised the stakes when it accused China of torturing a former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong, and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab summoned the Chinese ambassador in London.

The Chinese government warned at the time that further interference in Hong Kong “will eventually harm U.K. interests.”

A long-delayed decision on whether to allow Huawei access to the U.K.’s so-called 5G communications networks has the potential to fuel further tensions if Johnson succumbs to U.S. pressure to ban the Chinese company on security grounds.

The Financial Times recently reported that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up the pressure to block Huawei, citing an interview with national security adviser Robert O’Brien. The U.S. has warned allies that the Chinese government could gain a backdoor to communications networks, and has threatened to withdraw intelligence sharing.

The decision is fraught with risk, and Johnson has hinted the U.K. could follow some of its international security allies including Australia and New Zealand by restricting or banning the company — though he could seek a compromise by allowing Huawei to participate only in so-called non-core elements of the network.

“The hidden state subsidies to firms like Huawei, which are also said to co-operate with the human rights violations we’re seeing in Xinjiang, mean it is hard for our markets to trade on the same basis,” Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said. “Co-operation is important to both China and the U.K., but that has to be based on reality.”

For now, China’s decision to suspend the stock exchange link has more symbolic than financial significance. Only one Chinese company, Huatai Securities, has listed in London since the program launched last year, while no U.K. companies have come to the Shanghai exchange.

Huatai’s global depositary receipts tumbled 11 per cent in London following the news the link was suspended.

According to Pang Zhongying, a member of the Beijing-based Academic Committee of Pangoal Institution think tank, Brexit provides Johnson — who won a large majority in last month’s election — with an opportunity to reset ties with China.

“Britain needs to renegotiate a new trade and investment pact with its major business partners, including China and U.S. in the post-Brexit era, and that creates new opportunities for both countries,” he said. “As the world knows, the British government’s main focus is on Brexit and Hong Kong is absolutely not their priority.”

38896,c15626e45abd917bc04d1b9b6db25dca,"An appeals court ruled that a Babylon Village man was within his right to build an 86-square-foot treehouse without a permit, records show.

The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court handed down the Dec. 20 decision that reversed a lower court's ruling that John Lepper, who built the treehouse for his children, violated village code.

The higher court found that the village failed to establish facts, including that the treehouse constituted a building as defined in village code, thereby requiring a permit.

Village Court Judge John Rafter had convicted Lepper on four charges of violating village code and imposed sentences, including fines and ordered the treehouse removed.

Lepper paid the $475 fine and appealed the decision.

“I feel great,” Lepper said.

Babylon Village attorney Gerard Glass says the decision is no surprise because village officials knew there was an issue in the way the summons was written, and they could not correct it after the fact.

“This has no impact on the case whatsoever,” Glass said. “This has nothing to do with the substantive issues of the cause of why he didn’t get a building permit.”

Lepper has been battling with village officials since spring 2018 over the treehouse. He began constructing it at his Cockenoe Avenue home for his children Bayden, 6, and Brianna, 5.

He said he didn’t think he needed a permit because the 86-square-foot treehouse is less than the 90 square feet permitted in the village code for gyms and playgrounds.

But after he started building the structure, he received a letter from village officials saying he needed a permit and was later told he also needed a survey and architectural drawings.

He applied for a building permit and submitted the survey and architectural drawings, his Dix Hills-based attorney Cory Morris said.

Rafter ruled in October 2018 that the treehouse is a building, not a gym or playground, and is subject to building laws.

Lepper also sued the village and its officials in federal court over violating his First Amendment rights. He said the village has targeted him because he reported finding a medical syringe on his property.

All sides agreed that while the case winds its way through federal court, Lepper will not continue work on the treehouse and village officials will not further fine or remove the structure.

“I’m going to take this decision back to federal court to see what the judge has to say,” Lepper said. “Hopefully the stay will be lifted and allow the kids to use their treehouse and leave this family alone and enjoy their property.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3
38960,5fe3ef26fb2359eb6f72b39991d30fbd,"More Democratic presidential candidates than were on a recent debate stage officially entered the March 17 Illinois primary race Thursday, as filing for the office opened at the State Board of Elections.

Campaign representatives filed nominating petitions for 11 Democrats for the office. On the Republican side, U.S. Reps. Darin LaHood of Peoria and Mike Bost of Murphysboro, as well as GOP State Chairman Tim Schneider, were in line at 8 a.m. to file President Donald Trump's petitions for re-election. Later Thursday, John Schiess of Rice Lake, Wis., filed to run as a Republican.

Petitions were also filed for more than 500 people who want to be delegates or alternates to national party conventions this summer.

The two-day filing period for presidential candidates and convention delegate hopefuls continues Friday.

Unless there are successful objections to any presidential petitions filed, the Democratic field will include former Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneurs Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and former U.S. Rep. John Delaney.

Democratic Party debate rules this election cycle include requiring a mix of campaign donors and a threshold for performance in the polls. The most recent debate, Dec. 19 in Los Angeles, featured only seven candidates. The next debate is Jan. 14 in Des Moines, Iowa. The Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 open presidential primary voting.

In Illinois, a lottery Jan. 13 at the elections board office will determine ballot position from among the early filers. The nine Democrats who filed at 8 a.m. Thursday will be in that lottery. Bennet, whose petitions were filed after 9 a.m., will appear 10th on the ballot, and Delaney, who filed in the afternoon, will be 11th.

About two dozen people were in line Thursday as the filings started. It was in contrast to the hundreds of people who lined up Nov. 25 at the beginning of a filing period for offices such as congressional, legislative and judicial seats.

Kent Gray of Leland Grove, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016 and has staffed more than 50 trips with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, said he was first in line. He arrived about 11 p.m. Sunday and kept the place so Trump supporters could be first to file.

“It shows enthusiasm for our wonderful president,” said Gray, who sported a “Make America Great Again” hat from the 2016 contest.

Though Illinois voters have chosen Democrats for president since 1992, LaHood said he thinks Trump is “absolutely” in play in the state in the 2020 election.

The reason, he said, is “promises made, promises kept,” including thousands of jobs created and the lowest unemployment rate in decades.

“When people go into the voting booth in November and ask, 'Are their lives better today than they were four years ago?' absolutely they’re better,” LaHood said. “They’re better opportunity wise, better for their kids.”

LaHood and Bost dismissed the House impeachment of Trump as political. Bost said that independents he talks with in coffee shops, barbershops and beauty shops say, ""We’re tired of these games. Go back and do the things that we need to do.""

LaHood is a former prosecutor. Asked if he had any problem with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying he would coordinate with the White House in an impeachment trial, LaHood said, “This is a political process. This is not a court of law.”

The congressman represents the 18th Congressional District and is running to become a Trump delegate at the Republican National Convention. The convention happens Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte, N.C.

Chris Dunn of Wilmette, Illinois delegate selection coordinator for Biden, said Illinois is a “pretty blue state, so I would say no” to Trump being in play to win the state in November. But, he added, “We take nothing for granted.”

The slate of Biden delegate candidates, Dunn said, includes “community leaders and political leaders and government officials from across the state.""

“I think Vice President Biden is the best person to beat Donald Trump,” Dunn said. “The Biden message first of all is that we need to come back together as a nation. Because of the way the Trump campaign and the Trump administration is operating, our democracy is under a real threat. Facts matter, and the ability of Americans to talk to each other matters, and that’s what’s under threat. And I think Vice President Biden’s record both as vice president and in the Senate speaks for itself about how much he can accomplish.”

The Democratic convention is July 13-16 in Milwaukee.

General Parker of Peoria was among people filing as Sanders delegate candidates running in the 17th Congressional District. The retired boilermaker said he was without health insurance for a period and could not buy his blood pressure medication. His kidneys were damaged as a result.

“He’s always been (for) health care for all,” Parker said of Sanders. He also likes Sanders’ attention to the environment, helping the poor and “getting corruption out of politics.”

Ruth Hong Brininger of Romeoville filed as a delegate candidate for Yang in the 11th Congressional District. She said members of her family have health problems, including mental health challenges. She likes that Yang views success in terms of “human capital,” like job satisfaction, life expectancy and “how well our children are doing.""

“I think he has a chance nationwide once folks get a chance to kind of hear more about him,” Brininger said of Yang.

[BENGALURU] Fresh monetary stimulus in Beijing and growing Sino-US trade optimism helped European shares stay close to record highs on Thursday with banks and technology stocks leading a broad-based rally.

Riding the high tide across global markets, the pan-European stocks index Stoxx 600 jumped 0.9 per cent after declining for two straight sessions when caution crept in about how long a US-China trade truce would last.

But US President Donald Trump brightened the mood on Tuesday by saying the Phase 1 agreement would be signed on Jan 15 at the White House.

""There is an ongoing view from the market that 2020 may feel better than 2019 did,"" said Will James, deputy head of European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""There is more of a value bias to the market (given the) positive noise around trade.""

Lenders were on a tear, up 1.9 per cent at their highest in nearly eight months, followed by the technology sector that was driven by gains in trade-sensitive chip stocks.

China-exposed mining and auto shares were also among the biggest gainers along with industrials which were lifted by a 2.3 per cent jump in Airbus after it edged out Boeing to become the world's biggest planemaker.

That lifted the wider French index 1.1 per cent. Bank-heavy Spanish and Italian indices gained the most in the region, up around 1.4 per cent each, while German shares posted their best day in one month, shrugging off figures that showed the manufacturing sector contracted further in December.

Euro zone stocks jumped 1.2 per cent on Thursday despite latest data showing factory activity in the bloc contracting for the eleventh straight month.

39149,bb946ae5595e1755fb5cdca373b8b0ed,"WASHINGTON: Julian Castro, an Obama-era cabinet member and the only Hispanic candidate in the US presidential race, ended his 2020 White House bid Thursday after failing to boost his flagging poll numbers in a crowded Democratic field.

The 45-year-old former housing secretary and mayor of San Antonio, Texas rarely rose above 2% support.

His exit leaves 14 candidates, most of whom are white and older, in the battle to win the right to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in November.

“It’s with profound gratitude to all of our supporters that I suspend my campaign for president today,” Castro said on Twitter, adding that he would “keep fighting for an America where everyone counts”.

His tweet featured a three-minute video montage of clips from his campaign trail.

The video, which focuses on Castro’s work on immigration reform and race issues, appears to express frustration at the dwindling diversity in the Democratic field.

Castro attempted to make a splash during the September debate by going after frontrunner Joe Biden, accusing the former vice president of “forgetting what you said just two minutes ago”.

But the comment – seen as a below-the-belt attack – drew boos, and his campaign ultimately flatlined.

Castro and Senator Kamala Harris are two of the biggest names to drop out of the Democratic race, along with former congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the frontrunners for the nomination.

After announcing his departure, Castro quickly received accolades from fellow candidates.

“Your voice and campaign were invaluable in sticking up for underrepresented communities and pushing the field forward,” wrote Senator Cory Booker, the sole black candidate left in the race.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang congratulated Castro for his campaign that “elevated the right issues”.

“Too many Americans feel left out and left behind. I know you will continue to fight for them,” said Yang.

Neither Yang nor Booker has qualified for the January debate, and Yang was the sole candidate of colour on stage during the December debate.

-- --

Three rockets killed eight people including top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani after striking an Iraqi military base near Baghdad airport on Thursday evening, according to reports.

Tensions have escalated in the area over the past week after Iran-backed protesters surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, shouting, ""Death to America,"" and setting fires to the building on New Year's Eve.

""Urgent Iraqi security sources: The explosions were caused by the fall of 3 missiles in the back area of Baghdad Airport,"" tweeted Al Jazeera, according to a Google translation. The base where the rockets landed is a joint U.S./Iraqi counterterror center.

The three rockets are believed to have targeted an Iraqi counterterrorism center, a building used by the U.S. military, and a road outside the Baghdad airport.

Hezbolla's Mayadeen, a pan-Arabist television network, confirmed that Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, deputy commander of Popular Mobilization Forces, died during the rocket strikes.

The airspace above Baghdad International Airport appears to be closed, and U.S. helicopters have been spotted flying in the area.

Video posted to Twitter shows two cars on fire near the Baghdad International Airport, and sources claim at least 12 Iraqi soldiers were injured in the explosions.

In a statement released this morning, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, ""We must stand together against the malign and destabilizing actions of Iran.''

Authorities say they were called out to a crash in Victor, New York, around 10:30 p.m. New Year's Eve, where a vehicle had crashed into a ditch. There, deputies found Brian Kolb, who has represented his district located outside Rochester for the last twenty years, to be the driver of the 2018 GMC Acadia that had crashed in front of the state lawmaker's home.

A deputy with the Ontario County Sheriff's office performed field sobriety tests, which Kolb failed. At the jail, Kolb's blood-alcohol content was over the legal limit of 0.08 percent, Ontario County Sheriff Kevin Henderson said.

No one else was injured in the accident, authorities said.

Kolb acknowledged his arrest in a a brief statement on Wednesday, saying there was no excuse.

""I fully recognize the severity of the situation and I am profoundly sorry,"" Kolb said. ""There is no excuse and no justification for what occurred Tuesday evening. I made the wrong decision, and it is one I deeply regret.""

""This was a terrible lapse in judgment, one I have urged others not to make, and I take full responsibility for it,"" he added.

Only a week before his arrest, Kolb authored a column that appeared in a local newspaper that warned against drivers taking the wheel when they've been driving and that it was an especially bad decision during the holidays, writing that: ""tragedy can be only one bad decision away.""

Kolb has been charged with driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor, and released pending a future court appearance.

The Division of Public Health ordered China Dragon, at 1954 Maryland Ave., to close on Dec. 16 due to unsanitary conditions ""that may endanger public health,"" according to the inspection report. The restaurant was allowed to reopen the next day.

A manager or owner could not be immediately reached for comment.

During a routine inspection, the state official saw a dead mouse and roach on a trap under the steam table, which was near the bain-marie, according to the report. There was also a dead mouse behind the water heater.

Mouse droppings were found ""throughout (the) facility,"" the inspector wrote in the report. The state official also saw gnats inside a sink.

BEHIND OUR REPORTING Why we're doing this story

After the closings of the Burger King on Concord Pike and Waffle House in Smyrna in June 2018, The News Journal/Delaware Online learned the health department was not making restaurant inspections easily available to the public at the time. This led to The News Journal asking the Division of Public Health for this information on a regular basis, in order to inform readers about the conditions of the restaurants in their community. How we're doing this story

At the start of every week, News Journal reporters request food establishment cease and desists reports and inspections from the Division of Public Health. In October 2019, The News Journal created an online database for readers to view those inspection reports and cease and desists from the state health department. Readers can search the database by the food establishment's name or address, city, date, descriptive words or type of business — such as a restaurant, convenience store or grocery store. This is updated regularly. Our approach to covering this topic

We will continue to request restaurant inspections every week in the coming year. If you have ideas on how we can improve upon our coverage, please contact reporters Meredith Newman mnewman@delawareonline.com or Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com.

Hofler was detained and taken to Lawrence and Memorial Hospital with minor injuries, police said.

At the time of the crash, Hofler was free on a $35,000 bond from an October arrest and in possession of more than one ounce of marijuana, according to the Associated Press.

“This was a terrible lapse in judgment, one I have urged others not to make, and I take full responsibility for it,” the assemblyman said in a brief written statement. “I made the wrong decision, and it is one I deeply regret.”

Kolb has represented the district since 2000 and has served as Assembly minority leader since 2009. The district covers all of Ontario County and a portion of Seneca County. In 2018, Kolb briefly campaigned to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo before dropping out of the race.

On Christmas Eve, Kolb wrote a column in the upstate Daily Messenger newspaper that warned against driving while under the influence of alcohol during the holidays, and acknowledged December is National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month.

“Many of our holiday traditions, especially our New Year’s Eve celebrations, involve indulging in spirits,” he wrote. “Done safely, and in moderation, these can be wonderful holiday experiences. However, tragedy can be only one bad decision away.”

News of Kolb’s arrest led fellow Republican Assemblyman Kieran Michael Lalor to call for him to step down.

Kolb “should step down as Assembly Minority Leader,” Lalor tweeted. “That he hasn’t done so already is a disgrace.”

But Assembly Deputy Minority Leader William Barclay, also a Republican, said it’s “premature” to ask for Kolb’s resignation. Barclay said lawmakers will be back in Albany next week, and said Kolb should have a chance to speak before lawmakers decide how to move forward.

“I’ve talked to a lot of members,” he said. “I think there are people who are concerned.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

Millions of animals are dead and hundreds of thousands more will perish over coming days as a result of killer bushfires terrorising southeast Australia.

Native wildlife and agricultural livestock are among the fatalities, with already-endangered species at greater risk of extinction. The extent of the carnage may never be known.

""The fires will have killed millions of animals ... mammals, birds, reptiles,"" Wildlife Victoria boss Megan Davidson told AAP.

State Government of Victoria

And the threat is not over, with wildlife rescue groups likely to be helpless in many instances.

""It is largely a job of euthanasing at this stage, both livestock and wildlife,"" Dr Davidson said.

""They are so severely burned that there is nothing better you can do than end their suffering.""

In coming days more animals will die from starvation and heat stress as they battle to find food and shelter in their decimated habitat.

The nationally-endangered eastern bristlebird is one species of concern amid the fires which are straddling the NSW-Victorian border.

AAP

""There are only three populations in Australia and two are under threat,"" The University of Melbourne's Alan York said.

One of the small birds' habitats is near Jervis Bay on the NSW south coast and the other is Mallacoota in Victoria's East Gippsland, where fires forced people onto the beach to escape flames.

""It is a bird with very limited flight capabilities so it's very difficult for it to get out of the way of fire,"" Prof York said.

The eastern bristlebird's other habitat on the Gold Coast has also faced struggles in recent times but is not currently under threat from fire.

AAP

Despite the scale of destruction caused by the fires, both Prof York and Dr Davidson were hopeful that animal populations can recover.

""People get worried that species will become extinct but it's more about population size and they will return,"" he said.

""It is sometimes surprising how quickly things will recover - as soon as conditions are good again they can very rapidly breed up.""

Professor Davidson said everyone can help animals that are not only suffering from fires but from years of drought.

""It's grim, but we don't want people to despair.""

39656,5b10aa644f4ca0a83009e4011d66b31a,"A security firm with its own uniformed 'bobbies' is launching the UK's first private prosecutions against pickpockets and shoplifters.

The company My Local Bobby provides security for a fee, but says that police often release suspected pickpockets and shoplifters when they are handed over.

As a result, the firm run by former Scotland Yard officers is now setting up its own prosecution unit to pursue the cases itself, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Director David McKelvey said the company's move was a 'win-win' for the regular police who would have more time to investigate other crimes.

Private security: One of the 'bobbies' provided by the company My Local Bobby patrols a street in West London. The firm is now launching prosecutions against shoplifters and pickpockets

Mr McKelvey says frustration has grown as the private 'bobbies' have caught shoplifters and pickpockets but police have failed to bring charges.

'Police take ages to turn up and when they do, despite overwhelming evidence, they simply take off the handcuffs and release them,' Mr McKelvey says.

'What we have done now is to employ a new prosecution team on shoplifting, pickpockets, low-level assaults and drug dealing and we will prosecute these offences ourselves.'

Police often decline to take up a case because they were too busy to spend hours interviewing a suspect over a minor shoplifting, he said.

However, Mr McKelvey warns that 'that shoplifter is going to go on and shoplift the next day and the day after' if no action is taken.

Detectives have also reportedly cited a lack of space in police stations as a reason to release suspects.

My Local Bobby has 30 operatives in red uniforms who stay within five-minute reach of the properties they are guarding.

The founder of My Local Bobby says frustration has grown as the private 'bobbies' (left) have caught shoplifters and pickpockets but police (stock image right) have failed to bring charges

Households pay between £100 and £200 a month for the 24-hour security service, which has proved popular in wealthy parts of West London.

Mr McKelvey says the aim is to have 'bobbies' walking the streets who would reassure the public and know the neighbourhood well enough to spot problems.

The firm is regulated by the Security Industry Authority, which issues licences to private security workers.

The company boasts on its website that it has already undertaken 400 private prosecutions with a 100 per cent success rate.

Mr McKelvey is a former Met Police detective chief inspector who retired from Scotland Yard in 2008.

He founded the security firm with Tony Nash, another Met Police veteran who was a borough commander in Newham.

The National Police Chiefs' Council says officers work with private security 'on a daily basis' but that firms such as My Local Bobby should not 'replace' ordinary policing."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The federal government says the average Alberta household will receive about $880 under the rebate program, which is about $170 more than it is expected to pay.

Schweitzer said he doesn’t believe that will be the case.

“I don’t buy that at all. Look at Albertans right now. Alberta is struggling. We need jobs in this province,” he said.

“The cost of everything is going to start going up.”

The four-cent increase represents a carbon tax of $20 per tonne of carbon dioxide, increasing to $30 in the spring.

Those who live in small or rural communities will receive a higher rebate, and fuel used for farm machinery can be exempted from the tax.

Municipalities, public institutions, small businesses and Indigenous communities are also to receive extra funding to help them lower their energy costs.

Alberta is challenging the federal tax in the province’s Court of Appeal. Arguments were heard in December and the court has yet to rule.

Ontario and Saskatchewan lost previous challenges of the tax in their top courts and are appealing to the Supreme Court of Canada. Alberta is supporting them in their legal action.

“We’re waiting to see what the Alberta Court of Appeal’s decision will have in the New Year. And we’re hoping to have that decision done before the Supreme Court case, which is going to be heard in March,” Schweitzer said.

“We’re going to keep that fight going. This is federal overreach plain and simple. This is clearly provincial jurisdiction.”

Alberta had a consumer carbon tax under the previous New Democrat government, which was rescinded by the United Conservatives in May. The government has since imposed a carbon tax of $30 a tonne on industrial emitters, which has been approved by Ottawa.

“Alberta is doing its part to tackle global emissions. Our plan invests in real technological solutions. It doesn’t punish people for driving to work and heating their homes,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said Tuesday on Twitter.

He said his government won’t relent in its legal fight against the consumer tax.

“We won’t roll over like the previous NDP government did. This is Alberta’s jurisdiction, and we will fight for it.”

Iran's most powerful military commander, Gen Qasem Soleimani, has been killed by a US air strike in Iraq.

The 62-year-old spearheaded Iranian military operations in the Middle East as head of Iran's elite Quds Force.

He was killed at Baghdad airport, along with other Iran-backed militia figures, early on Friday in a strike ordered by US President Donald Trump.

Mr Trump said the general was ""directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of millions of people"".

Soleimani's killing marks a major escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran.

Under his leadership, Iran had bolstered Hezbollah in Lebanon and other pro-Iranian militant groups, expanded its military presence in Iraq and Syria and orchestrated Syria's offensive against rebel groups in the country's long civil war.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ""severe revenge awaits the criminals"" behind the attack. He also announced three days of national mourning.

Soleimani was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran, behind the Ayatollah Khamenei. The Quds Force, an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, reported directly to the ayatollah and Soleimani was hailed as a heroic national figure.

But the US has called the commander and the Quds Force terrorists and holds them responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US personnel.

President Trump, who was in Florida at the time of the strike, tweeted an image of the American flag shortly after the news broke.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The Pentagon confirmed that US forces had killed Gen Soleimani

Tweeting again on Friday, Mr Trump said Soleimani had ""killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans... and was plotting to kill many more"" and ""should have been taken out many years ago"".

""While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country,"" he said.

A statement from the Pentagon - the headquarters of the US Department of Defense - said Soleimani had been ""developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region"".

""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,"" it added.

Meanwhile, global oil prices have soared by more than 4% in the wake of the attack.

How did the strike take place and who was killed?

Soleimani and officials from Iran-backed militias were leaving Baghdad airport in two cars when they were hit by a US drone strike near a cargo area.

The commander had reportedly flown in from Lebanon or Syria. Several missiles struck the convoy and at least seven people are believed to have died.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was among those killed.

Muhandis commanded the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah group, which Washington blamed for a rocket attack which killed a US civilian contractor in northern Iraq last Friday.

He also effectively led the Popular Mobilisation units (PM), an umbrella of militias in Iraq dominated by groups aligned with Iran. Most of those killed in the strike belonged to the PM, the organisation said. Soleimani's son-in-law and a member of the Lebanese Hezbollah were also among the dead, it added.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis (centre) was also killed in Friday's strike

The Pentagon statement said: ""At the direction of the president, the US military has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani.""

It added: ""The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.""

The drone strike comes days after protesters attacked the US embassy in Baghdad, clashing with US forces at the scene. The Pentagon said Soleimani approved the attacks on the embassy.

Iran's most powerful military figure was regarded as the strategic mastermind behind its vast ambition in the Middle East and the country's real foreign minister when it came to matters of war and peace.

As commander of elite special forces, he orchestrated covert operations, involving a web of proxy militias, across the region. He also commanded political influence inside Iran and was regarded as second only to Iran's all-powerful Supreme Leader.

He was widely considered the architect of President Bashar al-Assad's war in Syria, the ongoing conflict in Iraq, the fight against Islamic State, and many battles beyond.

The silver-haired general with a close-cropped beard was a cult hero for his fighters and the face of evil for his foes. For years, US officials considered killing a cunning adversary who ordered attacks on their forces and taunted them with social media barbs.

At times some of their aims were aligned, including in the fight against Islamic State, but they remained sworn enemies.

Iranian officials are categorical - this is an act of war to be met by ""harsh retaliation"". Iran has many ways and means to strike back as a long-simmering crisis suddenly moves to a new, dangerous chapter.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet explains the significance of the attack

How has Iran responded?

Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called the attack an ""act of international terrorism"", tweeting that the US ""bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism"".

President Hassan Rouhani said in a statement: ""Iran and the other free nations of the region will take revenge for this gruesome crime from criminal America.""

His death, Mr Rouhani added, had redoubled Iran's determination ""to stand against America's bullying"".

Gen Esmail Qaani, deputy head of the Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations arm, was named as Soleimani's successor by Ayatollah Khamenei.

In other reaction:

Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi condemned the ""assassination"" of Soleimani as a ""dangerous escalation"" of regional tensions

Iran-backed Hezbollah group called for Soleimani's death to be avenged Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the US had the ""right "" to defend itself and praised President Trump for acting ""swiftly, forcefully and decisively""

In Washington, members of President Trump's Republican Party welcomed the news. Top House Republican Kevin McCarthy said the strike had been a ""display of resolve and strength"".

But Democrats were critical. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the move risked ""dangerous escalation"" and suggested Congress should have been consulted.

Later on Friday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the strike was ""lawful"" and ""saved lives"". He told Fox News: ""We do not seek war with Iran but we will not stand by and see American lives put at risk.""

Who was Qasem Soleimani?

From 1998, he led Iran's Quds Force which handles clandestine operations abroad.

Iran has acknowledged the role of the Quds Force in the conflicts in Syria, where it has advised forces supporting President Bashar al-Assad and armed thousands of Shia Muslim militiamen fighting alongside them, and in Iraq, where it has backed a Shia-dominated paramilitary force that helped tackle IS.

These conflicts turned the once-reclusive Soleimani into a something of celebrity in Iran.

The Trump administration has alleged that the Quds Force is ""Iran's primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting"" US-designated terrorist groups across the Middle East - including Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - by providing funding, training, weapons and equipment.

The US designated Iran's Revolutionary Guards and its Quds Force as foreign terrorist organisations in April.", Accuse of aggression,3
39832,b21bd3af9d32ab96cde31ea0e533cf80,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) — Attorneys are alleging that Donald W. Trautman, as auxiliary bishop of the Buffalo Diocese in the 1980s, used an annulment as a tool to silence a victim of child sexual abuse by a priest.

The allegation was made by an unnamed plaintiff who filed a new lawsuit Thursday in State Supreme Court alleging abuse by now-deceased priest Gerard Smyczynski.

The abuse allegedly occurred in the 1980s, when Smyczynski was a priest in the Buffalo Diocese, and Trautman paid ""a paltry sum of money to the survivor of the abuse, which amounts to hush money,"" said attorney Paul Barr, who is representing the alleged victim.

Trautman then offered to speed along the marriage annulment of the child's parents in exchange for them staying quiet about the abuse, the lawsuit alleges. Annulments, which are similar in the Catholic Church to a divorce, are sometimes difficult to obtain.

""The average time of an annulment, it's about 18 months [to] as much as two years, and there's no guarantee,"" said James Faluszczak, a former priest under Trautman who now advocates for survivors. ""I have never seen even the easiest annulments handled this quickly. It’s just bizarre.""

Trautman, who later went on to become bishop of Erie, Pa., did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.

But Faluszczak and Barr said his alleged cover-up of the abuse enabled the client of Barr's law firm, who was 10 years old at the time, to be abused by Smyczynski, who is on the diocese's official list of credibly accused priests.

""Bishop Trautman never called the police,"" Barr said. ""He never called the district attorney. As a result, our client that we filed the case for today was abused.""

Trautman, who is now retired as Bishop of Erie, drew controversy in June by admitting that he blamed a victim of clergy sexual abuse for putting himself in the position to be molested.

Greg Tucker, an interim spokesman for the Buffalo Diocese, said in a written statement, ""With regard to the Reverend Gerard Smyczynski, now deceased, his faculties were removed in 1985 and his name is included on the list of credibly accused clergy. The Diocese – now under the interim leadership of Bishop Edward Scharfenberger as Apostolic Administrator – is assessing the appropriate level of additional detail relating to those credibly accused that may be provided as part of the Diocese’s ongoing reporting, which may contribute to the healing of survivors who continue to be our first priority.”", Bring lawsuit against ,3

The Bible mentions a whole lot of people who remain a mystery to this day, from Adam and Eve to the Antichrist. Naturally, many of these characters haven't been historically verified, and quite a few have been written off as nothing more than metaphors. The Queen of Sheba is one such figure, largely because she only shows up in one Biblical story.

The tale goes that she heard King Solomon was this awesome, smart ruler. So she rolled up in all her gold and finery to test him with riddles. Solomon answered every question, and as a result, the queen was pretty impressed. She then gave him gifts of gold and spices, and in return, the (obviously smitten) king gave her ""all she desired."" And then the queen sauntered off back to her own land.

However, the queen is way too cool to just be featured in one Bible story. She actually appears in other tales in holy books like the Quran, but what's the real deal about this mysterious figure?

Mr Cummings posted an apparent job advert on Thursday saying Number 10 wants to hire an “unusual set of people with different skills and backgrounds” to work as special advisers and potentially officials.

The blog post exceeding 2,900 words came amid reports that the Prime Minister is planning “seismic changes” to the civil service.

Mr Cummings, a former Vote Leave director, said he hopes to be made “largely redundant” within a year by the recruitment drive.

He called for officials including “weirdos and misfits with odd skills”, data scientists and policy experts to apply to a gmail account if they think they fit the bill.

Mr Cummings warned that there is “some profound problems at the core of how the British state makes decisions” and that he currently makes decisions “well outside” his “circle of competence”.

And he says the need for change comes with Brexit requiring large policy and decision-making structure changes and a Government with an 80-strong majority having “little need to worry about short-term unpopularity”.

Under a subsection on hiring “super-talented weirdos”, he writes that the Government needs “some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole”.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson with his senior aide Dominic Cummings (Victoria Jones/PA)

Mr Cummings’ post came after Rachel Wolf, who helped draw up the blueprint of Tory election pledges, said civil servants could be made to take regular exams to prove they are up to their Whitehall jobs.

Under “seismic” changes being planned by Number 10, she also said that civil servants are “woefully unprepared” for sweeping reforms that Mr Johnson is keen to push through.

Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, warned that it is unclear how the new recruits would be selected or what their roles would be.

“Civil servants are recruited on merit, not patronage – a critical principle if they are to provide the best impartial advice to ministers,” Mr Penman added.

“It would be ironic if, in an attempt to bring in radical new thinking, Cummings was to surround himself with like-minded individuals – recruited for what they believe, not what they can do – and less able to provide the robust advice a minister may need, rather than simply the advice they want.”

Mr Penman also blamed officials’ salary levels as being a restricting factor for recruiting a wider pool of talent.

“Similarly, Cummings’s call to world-class experts to join government may flounder on the pay rates, which are typically half of those paid elsewhere. All senior civil service roles are already open to external competition, yet time and again, government’s failure to pay a market rate restricts the pool,” Mr Penman said."," Threaten, not specified below",3

A 33-year-old man, identified as Igboghami Walter, has been stabbed to death over the sharing of some unnamed items.

Walter was said to have been involved in an altercation with his friend in the Omelema community in the Abua/Odual Local Government Area of Rivers State before he was stabbed to death on Sunday, December 29, 2019.

The victim, who hailed from Amalem in the Abua/Odual LGA, had visited his friend in the same community to demand his share of the items.

It was gathered that Walter claimed that his friend swindled him out of the items and took a larger portion, leaving him with a fraction of the goods.

Southern City News learnt that his assailant fled the scene after he noticed that Water had fallen to the ground and was in a pool of his own blood.

An eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the victim had complained of being cheated by his friend after they had shared among themselves some of the unidentified items.

The source added that the victim confronted his assailant to demand his full share, an action which sparked a heated argument.

He added that Walter was subsequently stabbed in the stomach with a knife.

The source said the victim was immediately rushed to the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital for medical attention, but died on the way and his remains were deposited in the morgue by members of his family.

The source stated, “The victim was my secondary school mate; he was from the Omelema community and his name was Igboghami Walter. He was stabbed by his friend at the Omelema community on Sunday night after a struggle.

“He had earlier complained that his friend cheated him after they shared some items. I don’t know the items they shared, but it was when he confronted his friend to demand an equal share of the items that a quarrel started, which led to a fight and unfortunately, he was stabbed in the stomach by his friend.

“The victim collapsed and was later rushed from Abua to the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital for urgent attention and treatment, but he died on the way.”

Super-rich parents are hiring former special forces soldiers to stop their kids getting dragged into County Lines gangs.

The bodyguards are being paid up to £150,000-a-year to act as close personal protection “nannies” for kids of Russian and Middle Eastern millionaires living in London.

Magoo Giles, principal and founder of the £20,000-a-year Knightsbridge School, said that several of his pupils had private security guards taking them to and from school.

The former Coldstream Guard added that “a lot of schools in this area have a similar arrangement”.

Sam Martin, co-founder of 19 London, an international agency providing staff for rich and high-profile individuals, said that rising crime in the capital had led to a surge in demand for close protection services.

He said: “All of the bodyguards that we recruit are ex-military. However, when it comes to close protection for children, clients tend to demand more high-level staff, someone who is trained in emergency first aid and possibly from special forces like the SAS.

“They tend to be foreign nationals and mostly from Russia.”

In the past five years, crime in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, London’s two most expensive areas, has risen significantly.

But as well as street crime, many parents are worried about their kids getting dragged into other forms of criminality.

Security expert Sergei Migdal said many people who hired child protection did so mostly as a precaution against threats that might arise from their “business dealings”.

“People wanting this sort of protection come from places where the criminal model includes kidnapping and ransom, and in the 1990s in Russia this was the way they operated,” Mr Migdal, a former Israeli criminal intelligence officer, said.

Mr Martin said that early career close protection officers could expect to be paid up to £70,000 a year, and more experienced bodyguards may earn up to £150,000."," Threaten, not specified below",3
40245,3b695fdfad057af988532555216672fd,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned what it termed the unwarranted and vindictive demolition of a property belonging to former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Kwara State government.

PDP described the invasion and demolition as wicked, cowardly and a direct recipe for huge crisis in the State.

The party stated that it was clear that the action of the state government was borne out of hatred and political intolerance, in furtherance of the larger plot by the APC and its administration to intimidate, suppress, hound, crush and silence opposition and dissenting voices in our country, in the bid to foist a siege mentality on the citizenry.

A statement by PDP’s spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan dismissed the reasons given by the APC administration for its New Year “dastardly act as baseless, false and incongruous, as they failed to add up, to justify the ferocious invasion, harassment of citizens and demolition of the said property.”

The statement reads: “The demolition is a complete subversion of rule of law as the matter is already in court. The APC-led Kwara state government could not wait for the outcome of the court process apparently because it knows that it is pursuing an illegal agenda.

“Nigerians know how the APC and its government have been hounding, harassing and dragging Senator Saraki around over trumped-up charges, for daring to be among compatriots at the forefront of the quest to rescue our nation from misrule and strangleholds of the APC and its

cabal.

“The APC and Kwara state government should perish their idea of trying to use false claims and propaganda to justify their wicked act and take

over the property, as such cannot hoodwink Nigerians from the truth.

“Moreover, the timing of the invasion and demolition, in the wee hours and under the cover of darkness, is a direct indication that the state government was carrying out an unwholesome and condemnable operation during which defenceless women were fired with gunshots.”

PDP urged Nigerians to note that demolition of property, genuinely belonging to opposition leaders and other Nigerians perceived to be opposed to APC’s oppressive administration, has become a policy of the APC and its government in their bid to subjugate Nigerians and exclusively appropriate our common patrimomy for their selfish purposes.

“Nigerians have not forgotten how APC leaders, including those at the Presidency, applauded whenever property belonging to perceived political opponents was unjustly and viciously pulled down in APC-controlled states and even in Abuja.

“We, however, caution the APC, its administration, and in this particular case, the Kwara state government, against crossing the boundaries and stretching the forbearance of the people, which is already causing tension that could trigger serious unrest in our country.

“It is also instructive to note that in the years the PDP governed Kwara state, there was no case of government demolishing the property of opposition members or supporters under any guise whatsoever.

“Our party, therefore, stands with Senator Saraki and cautions the Kwara state government to henceforth steer clear of the property,” the statement added"," Threaten, not specified below",3
40270,aa2323cddf21f610b050aecb41bdbf9a,"Surprise! Doctor Who‘s The Master continues to be an expert at refusing to die. The revelation that O is actually The Master threw most fans for a loop, especially after Missy’s redemption arc and death in Series 10. Sacha Dhawan’s already-brilliant version of this character brings all the expected diabolical campiness, unbridled chaos, and questions about his motivations.

Like The Doctor, there are always a ton of thoughts and theories about their past and how swirling timelines can make things super confusing. And, when you think about it, this Master may not be who we think he is after all. Let’s explore some questions that need answers about the return of The Doctor’s biggest frenemy.

Where does this incarnation fall in the timeline?

Some fans assumed that this Master follows Missy, but that doesn’t have to be the case. He’s likely an incarnation between John Simm’s version of The Master and Missy, which would explain why his personality is back to its homicidal norm once again.

This would be a great choice because it won’t negate the final moments of Missy’s arc and it explains why the Part 2 teaser includes Morse code that mimics the drumbeat from the Tenth Doctor era. Or, this Master might be before the Harold Saxon and Professor Yana. Perhaps he is the version that The Doctor thought he defeated during the Time War. There are a lot of fun and twisty turn that this could take.

via GIPHY

Is this Master from another universe?

Multiple universes are all the rage in comics and on TV. Doctor Who hasn’t really explored parallel Earths in a while, but it looks like multiverses will be making a comeback this season. The Doctor saw several maps of alien spies on a few Earths, which means that whatever is going on right now is happening—or has happened—in several universes already. This Master may not be the one we know so well, but rather a Master from a completely different universe.

What if this Master has defeated other universes (and Doctors) and decided to infiltrate MI6 on this planet to learn more about how our Doctor works? It’s a wild thought but not completely out of the way. Maybe the Morse code seen in the Part 2 preview is a signal to other Masters to come together and cause chaos. If so, this could be The Doctor’s biggest challenge yet.

via GIPHY

What does The Master know about The Timeless Child?

The who? The what? In case you forgot, Series 11’s Remnants monsters terrified The Doctor with the mention of the “outcast, abandoned, and unknown” Timeless Child. They said they could see what was hidden from The Doctor, which falls in line with The Master’s warning that what The Doctor thinks they know is a lie. This Timeless Child doesn’t fit The Doctor considering they are far from unknown. But, maybe it’s a reference to a deeper truth about The Doctor prior to the incarnations we have seen or Gallifrey as a whole. The light beings that The Master is working with might be tied to this Timeless Child entity.

Several fans, including Reddit user BigTiddyGothVVitch (haha!) suggested that The Master may either be or work with Omega, a Classic Who character who was revered as a hero but felt abandoned and lost his mind in a different universe. This would be a really cool tie back to the show’s earlier years and could create some great new lore in Gallifrey’s history.

There’s a lot of avenues that the show might take with this Master. Maybe he will end up being the Timeless Child or play a role in the unraveling of a dark truth about The Doctor. Is he a universe hopping menace? A previously unseen incarnation from this universe? Or will The Master turn out to not be the Time Lord we thought he was all along? Series 12 has certainly set a big story in motion and we are ready for more revelations.

40320,b40e561f47313c5aeab84d3f9fa48b80,"SAN DIEGO — Six lawsuits were filed Thursday against the Catholic Diocese of San Diego and numerous local parishes on behalf of alleged victims of childhood sexual abuse, with recently enacted legislation allowing such legal action even if the alleged abuse occurred outside of the statute of limitations.

The suits allege abuse in the 1960s and 70s by now-deceased priests who operated throughout San Diego County. The victims were previously unable to pursue legal action against the Diocese, but recently enacted AB 218 expands the statute of limitations and opened a three-year window starting this year for victims to file suit.

Attorney Irwin Zalkin said that each time abuse was discovered, priests were simply moved to other parishes where they could continue their behavior, with free access to new victims.

According to Zalkin, the Diocese routinely dealt with the problem of “bad priests” by sending them to desert communities, “where they thought they could hide, where they thought that the people there — mostly Hispanic — would not speak up, and they would be out of the limelight, so to speak.”

Zalkin’s office filed six lawsuits Thursday on behalf of 20 victims, but he said around 60 additional lawsuits are still being prepared and will be filed within the next 60 to 90 days.

“This is only the beginning,” Zalkin said at a Thursday news conference. “Now (the victims) have a chance to be heard and to hold this Diocese accountable.”

Among the priests targeted in Thursday’s lawsuits are:

Robert Koerner, who worked out of a parish in Calipatria;

Peter Marron, who served in San Diego;

Alexander Pinter, who served in Vista;

Anthony Rodrigue, who served in La Jolla, Lakeside, Encinitas, Poway and other locations in Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial counties;

Joseph Rossell, who served in National City, San Diego, Carlsbad, El Cajon and Oceanside; and

Gregory Sheridan, who served in San Diego, Ramona, and Fallbrook.

Kevin C. Eckery, vice chancellor and diocese spokesman, released a statement Thursday decrying the actions of abusive priests and urging victims to contact the church for compensation and counseling, which they can receive whether or not they decide to take legal action.

“Regardless of the legal issues involved, we have a moral obligation to provide assistance to any victim-survivor of that abuse and we would urge their attorney to contact us so that counseling can be arranged at our expense,” Eckery said. “There are no prior conditions and the offer of counseling stands regardless of any lawsuit against the diocese. The sexual abuse of minors is evil, regardless of when it happens, but as a result of various reforms in 2002 and earlier, including mandatory Safe Environment training for clergy and all church workers, annual age-appropriate safety training for students in Catholic schools and religious education, enhanced criminal background checks and enhanced awareness and vigilance, no new incidents of abuse have been reported to the diocese in nearly two decades.”

Zalkin said the diocese has offered settlements to the plaintiffs from a victim compensation fund established last fall, but he considered the amounts offered — around $200,000 each — “an insult.”

Zalkin also called the compensation fund offers a “convenient apology” that only came about once AB 218 was introduced, when the diocese “knew the statute of limitations was about to change, when they knew that they were going to be exposed to lawsuits and multi-millions in damages.”", Bring lawsuit against ,3

Distraught homeowners and other policyholders have already filed 4,299 claims in relation to the blazes, according to the Insurance Council Of Australia, which estimates the cost of damages has hit £158 million.

As the fires continue to burn, local news sources have reported that insurance claims could top £320 million.

Insurers are bracing themselves for a deluge of claims connected to the Australian wildfires

Global reinsurance firms, such as Swiss Re and London-listed Hiscox, will eye the rising claims warily. Though most are likely to be limited to Australian firms, reinsurers take on risk from policies worldwide.

Lloyd’s of London, the insurance and reinsurance market, said it is too early to put a number on the impact the blazes will have on its members.

New South Wales (pictured) has been the worst-hit area, although South Australia, Victoria and Queensland have also been ravaged. As of yesterday, New South Wales reported 1,289 homes destroyed and 442 damaged, and 2,218 outbuildings destroyed with 937 damaged.

The death toll is expected to rise as temperatures are set to hit 45C (113F) over the weekend, with 18 fatalities already recorded.

Two years ago, accountant Deloitte warned that Australia would face growing costs from natural disasters. The total could hit £21 billion per year by 2050, it added. Australia experienced its hottest year on record in 2019. The average maximum temperature across Australia reached a record 41.9C (107.4F) on December 18.

However, the costs of the current spate of wildfires is not thought to be as disastrous as the Black Saturday fires which rampaged across the country in 2009.

A royal commission which was called in the wake of that crisis put the cost at £2.3 billion, of which £640 million was insurance claims.

Share this article

Red wolves are nearing extinction, according to North Carolina’s governor. In November, Gov. Roy Cooper sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Interior seeking “immediate help” for the 14 or so wild red wolves left in the state. The “sharply worded letter” warned that, without any assistance, “the American red wolf is on the brink of extinction,” the Associated Press reports. Further, for the first time in the reintroduction program’s history, no red wolf pups were born in the wild in 2019.

In the Nov. 22 letter, Cooper wrote that “changes in management strategies over the last several years have diminished the wild population to a dangerous level. This population decline has occurred despite the availability of proven conservation strategies, such as coyote sterilization and captive wolf reintroductions.”

Prior to Cooper’s letter, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit asking for FWS to “commit to a deadline for a new recovery plan” while the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a lawsuit “seeking documents pertaining to red wolf decision-making,” according to the Associated Press.

As goHUNT previously reported, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) red wolf management strategy came under fire and was completely derailed after a federal judge put an end to FWS’s “shoot-to-kill authorization” and ordered the agency to prove that these wolves are a threat to humans or livestock. The unique species has been a controversial topic among both residents and environmentalists and recovery efforts have been met with strong opposition from wildlife officials and landowners. According to Associated Press, their current range is limited to five North Carolina counties with an additional 200 wolves living in captive breeding programs.

In response to Cooper’s November letter, FWS said that it “plans to begin updating the recovery plan in 2020” after figuring out which scientists should be appointed to the panel of advisors. FWS Field Supervisor Pete Benjamin also said that they plan to relocate two wolves from a Florida refuge into the area to promote breeding and add a third male wolf to pair with a female already in the North Carolina recovery area.

While these actions “could help diversify the wild gene pool in North Carolina,” Heather Clarkson, a representative with the Defenders of Wildlife, says “These…pairs are great, but they’re just not enough.”

Yet, there’s no long-term plans for red wolf recovery as of now."," Threaten, not specified below",3
40530,f0822189ffab8dee78e045eff9306e93,"GLYNDON, Minn. — Shovels and snowblowers were put to work Thursday morning, Jan. 2, after the Dilworth-Glyndon-Felton School District sent out a call for workers to help clear snow from the roof of the district's high school in Glyndon.

The move was recommended by a structural engineer who felt recent heavy snow put the building at risk.

As an added precaution, the school district shut down all of its buildings through Friday, Jan. 3.

Last spring, the Fargo-Moorhead area learned the hard way that heavy snow and rooftops don't mix.

listen live watch live

On Sunday, March 10, a number of roof collapses came to light after a storm dropped about 9 inches of heavy, wet snow in the area.

One collapse occurred at St. Francis de Sales Catholic Church in north Moorhead. Services at the church were canceled that morning due to the weather, which likely prevented a greater tragedy.

The portion of roof that collapsed was above a large community room that was built in the mid-1990s and which today has a new roof that was completed last June.

The rebuilt roof appeared to be holding up well Thursday morning, though it was still covered with snow from a recent storm that dropped between 12 and 17 inches of snow on the Fargo-Moorhead area.

The March snowfall that caused the collapse last year may not have been as deep in total inches, but it was a very wet, heavy snow, recalled Dennis Ouderkirk, parish secretary.

A recent test

Ouderkirk said a breakfast had been planned for the morning the roof collapsed last March, but cancellation of activities that day meant that instead of the parish center being full, it was largely empty, except for a piano, furniture and religious statuary.

According to Ouderkirk, the new roof has additional trusses for added strength, but just to be on the safe side, workers planned to arrive in the near future to clear snow from areas of the roof where it traditionally collects.

""This will be a good test,"" he said, referring to the recent snowfall.

A spokeswoman for Moorhead Area Public Schools said Thursday that a consultant was reviewing whether snow loads were a concern for district buildings.

The Fargo School District said crews had removed snow from some roofs since the recent storm and monitoring of snow loads was ongoing.

""All of our schools are designed with our winter elements in mind; however, some of our buildings have roof architecture or are impacted by the wind differently that cause us to monitor their roof more closely than others,"" said AnnMarie Campbell, a district spokeswoman.

The West Fargo School District has measured the snow loads on its buildings and there is no concern at present, said Heather Leas, a district spokeswoman.

""Since we are so early-on with winter, we do have crews coming in next week to remove snow on roofs that are reaching load capacity, so it does not become an issue after the next snowfall,"" Leas added.

A spokesman for a company that sells sensors that can warn when a roof is failing said such failures often result from a number of factors, not just one, such as a large snowfall.

Chris Collings, who is involved with product design and sales at Safe Roof Systems, a Massachusetts-based company, said even a relatively moderate snowfall of, say, 6 inches can turn much more serious if it's followed by rainfall that saturates the snow and significantly increases its heft.

It is during those times a company like SRS can play a crucial role, according to Collings, who said sensor systems the company installs measure joist deflection, which provides early warning when roof sag reaches the danger point.

Collings said SRS has worked extensively in the Northeast region of the country installing systems on school buildings and other structures, though he said it is increasing its presence in the Midwest, including an installation in Belcourt, N.D.

A basic installation can cost in the neighborhood of $12,000, but depending on the size of a building the price can be upwards of four times that, according to Collings.

He added that many customers come to SRF after experiencing a structural failure due to snow, so they already know how costly it can be to have a roof cave in.

Important as it is to know when snow is causing a problem, Collings said it can be just as important to know when it is not, so a business or school doesn't have to pay to remove snow that isn't a danger.

Snow removal, he said, can ""annihilate"" a school district's budget."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, a leading youth organisation of Assam, on Thursday said the state should follow Kerala in adopting a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) during its special session on January 13.

“If Kerala Assembly can take a resolution, why can’t Assam? If Manipur and Meghalaya can get inner-line permit (ILP) and be exempted from CAA after their chief ministers expressed reservations about the law, why can’t our chief minister take a stand against CAA? It is a request to Assam Assembly to adopt a resolution against CAA, given the widespread and sustained protests,” AJYCP general secretary Palash Changmai said.

The Kerala Assembly had passed a resolution, demanding withdrawal of CAA, on Tuesday. On December 19, the Meghalaya Assembly had adopted a resolution to move the Centre for implementation of ILP, which regulates entry of outsiders. The entire Nagaland is now under ILP with Dimapur being brought under the regime last month.

The AJYCP said it would move the Supreme Court for implementation of ILP in Assam and against CAA on January 5.

The agenda of the daylong Assembly session in Assam has not yet been disclosed but the Opposition Congress and AIUDF had called for a special session in view of the widespread protests against CAA.

Changmai, while declaring a series of agitation against CAA, said if the Centre had granted ILP to Assam earlier, the state would not have faced the crisis of survival today.

“The AJYCP, since its formation in 1978, has been demanding ILP. We need it for the protection of the political and land rights of the indigenous people. The Assembly must adopt a resolution to urge the Centre to implement ILP in Assam,” he added.

Reacting to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s remark. “Please don’t isolate me. If you isolate me where will I go?” Changmai said, “Sonowal is the only chief minister who has killed citizens to bring in foreigners. Stop shedding crocodile tears and stay on the side of the people of Assam instead of doing the Centre’s bidding.”

Reacting to Sonowal’s remark, “Moi ki bhul krilu (What wrong I have done?)” and to his appeal to trust him, Changmai said, “The people of Assam committed a mistake by electing him as the chief minister. Sonowal had promised to implement the Assam Accord and deport foreigners. Now they are bringing foreigners. Is it not a betrayal of the faith reposed in him?”

The AJYCP alleged that the ruling BJP had resorted to “dominance, sops and hired turnout” to divert/douse the anti-CAA agitation. Changmai said it first tried “dominance” by imposing curfew, gunning down protesters and suspending Internet service.

“After dominance failed, it started announcing sops like recruitment to 55,000 grade III and IV posts in state government departments, one-time aid of Rs 50,000 each to 2,000 artistes, Rs 50,000 each to 1,000 budding sportspersons and Rs 50,000 each to 1,000 writers,” he added.

“The people who participated in the peace rally were hired and paid Rs 250 to Rs 500 each to attend the meeting, though the charge has been denied by the government ministers. Even the state government’s peace and progress rally could not restore trust. Their peace rallies were a failure,” Changmai alleged.", Accuse of aggression,3

If any decision was taken in the meeting that was held following the said notification, they stand cancelled,” Justice Arindam Sinha in his verdict said.

A lawyer not connected with the case said the meeting at the civic body in the morning, in which Trinamul councillors voted 19-0 against Bhatpara municipality chairman Sourav Singh, stood null and void after the high court’s order.

Fourteen of the 33 councillors skipped the voting and were waiting for the result of their case in the high court over the validity of the notification for the no-confidence motion.

Later in the evening, Trinamul Congress leader and minister Jyotipriya Mullick said the party would challenge the verdict before a division bench of the high court on Friday.

“We were confident enough to regain power since most of the councillors, who had left us had returned realising their mistakes. Today’s result proved that people are no longer with the BJP,” said Mullick, who is also Trinamul’s North 24-Parganas district president.

The equations in the civic body changed after 26 Trinamul Councillors joined the BJP following the Lok Sabha polls. BJP MP Arjun Singh, who was earlier the chairman of the Trinamul-run board, resigned and his nephew Sourav Singh, who also defected from Trinamul to the BJP, became the chairman in June last year.

But over the past few months, most the defectors started returning to Trinamul, following which the ruling party moved a no-confidence motion against the chairman.

A self-imposed ban on such tests -- Kim declared they were no longer needed -- has been a centrepiece of the nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington over the past two years, which has seen three meetings between Kim and the US president, but little tangible progress.

Any actual test is likely to infuriate Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Kim's ""promise"" to him not to carry them out, and has downplayed launches of shorter-range weapons.

Negotiations between the two sides have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit in February. The North set the US an end-of-2019 deadline for it to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, or it would adopt a ""new way"".

""There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to the commitment any longer,"" the official KCNA news agency cited Kim as telling top ruling party officials.

""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" he added, referring to the North by its official name.

The full meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party was an indication of a major policy shift.

Story continues

State television showed veteran newsreader Ri Chun Hee reading out the KCNA dispatch over footage of Kim addressing the officials and general imagery of the country.

The broadcast appeared to stand in place of Kim's usual New Year speech -- normally a key moment in the North Korean political calendar.

Kim acknowledged the impact of international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programmes, but made clear that the North was willing to pay the price to preserve its nuclear capability.

""The US is raising demands contrary to the fundamental interests of our state and is adopting brigandish attitude,"" KCNA cited him as saying.

Washington had ""conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop"" and sent high-tech military equipment to the South, he said.

- 'Geopolitical chicken' -

For months, Pyongyang has been demanding the easing of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Washington has insisted it take more tangible steps towards giving them up.

""North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to Donald Trump's head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee,"" said Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington.

""Kim Jong-un is playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken,"" he added.

The strategy was risky, he said, as Washington was likely to respond with ""more sanctions, an increased military presence in East Asia and more fire and fury style threats coming from Donald Trump's Twitter account"".

Kim's moratorium comments were ""ominous"", said Leif-Eric Easley of Ewha University in Seoul, but added that he could be looking to ""elicit concessions by approaching Trump's red line without crossing it"".

The US has already indicated that it will react if the North carries out a long-range missile test.

Speaking to Fox News and CBS after Kim's announcement, Pompeo said a resumption of nuclear and missile tests would be ""deeply disappointing"".

""We hope that Chairman Kim will take a different course... that he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,"" Pompeo said.

""We want peace, not confrontation,"" he added, with Seoul's unification ministry adding that a strategic weapon test ""would not help denuclearisation negotiations"".

Trump himself was emollient, saying that he thought Kim was ""a man of his word"" and that at their Singapore summit, ""we did sign a contract, talking about denuclearisation"".

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern over North Korea's announcement and ""very much hopes that the tests will not resume,"" his spokesman said.

""Non-proliferation remains a fundamental pillar of global nuclear security,"" he added.

An ICBM launch would be likely to frustrate China, the North's key diplomatic backer and provider of trade and aid, which always stresses stability in a region it regards as its own back yard."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Published 2 January 2020

Grafton Thomas is accused of committing the horrific, anti-Semitic attacks in Monsey, New York last Saturday. Marty Lederman writes that “One might have expected (I did) that the United States would have charged Thomas with violations of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, 18 U.S.C. 249(a),” but that for some reason, “the government has instead elected to charge Thomas pursuant to a different criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. 247(a)(2).” “It’s… likely the government will be able to satisfy the commerce element of Section 247(a)(2),” he writes,” “but it would’ve been much easier for the government to satisfy the different commerce element prescribed by Section 249(a)(2).”

Grafton Thomas is accused of committing the horrific, anti-Semitic attacks in Monsey, New York last Saturday. Marty Lederman writes in Just Security that the State of New York presumably could have brought charges against him (for example, attempted murder). On Monday, however, the federal government filed a criminal Complaint against him instead.

Lederman writes:

One might have expected (I did) that the United States would have charged Thomas with violations of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, 18 U.S.C. 249(a), given that Thomas allegedly used a dangerous weapon (a machete) to cause bodily injury to several persons because they were Jewish.

For some reason, however, the government has instead elected to charge Thomas pursuant to a different criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. 247(a)(2), which makes it unlawful to “intentionally obstruct[], by force or threat of force, … any person in the enjoyment of that person’s free exercise of religious beliefs” where “the offense is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce.”

Unless there’s something unusual about the case that’s not immediately apparent, the government’s decision to use Section 247 but not Section 249 will probably make successful prosecution more difficult, for several reasons.

Lederman offers a detailed explanation of the statutes, concluding:

It’s… likely the government will be able to satisfy the commerce element of Section 247(a)(2)–but it would’ve been much easier for the government to satisfy the different commerce element prescribed by Section 249(a)(2). Moreover, the prosecution might have difficulty showing that Thomas intentionally tried to obstruct his victims’ religious exercise–a showing it would not have had to make if it had brought charges under Section 249(a) instead of under Section 247(a).", Accuse of aggression,3

HSBC is considering another round of deep job cuts that could result in as many as 10,000 more staff being made redundant across its global business with up to 1,000 UK staff under threat, i has learned.

Sources familiar with the proposals revealed that a second mass wave of redundancies are planned for the middle of this year.

The cuts will be on top of 10,000 worldwide redundancies announced last October, as well as the 4,700 cuts revealed last August.

Decision due at end of February

Further details of the cuts and retail banking plans for mainland Europe are expected to be confirmed when the bank will reveal its annual results and updates the markets on the progress of the strategic review at the end of February.

If given approval by the bank’s board, the latest job losses will mean HSBC would have cut its workforce by almost 25,000 to around 218,000 in less than a year as it continues a strategy of refocusing the business on the more profitable corporate banking sector and its Asian units.



Last October the bank appointed Lazard to offload its French retail banking unit for around €1bn (£850m). The bank is working with Lazard to prepare the sale of its 270 branches across the country. The auction for the business is expected to kick off later this month, with the banking arm of French mail operator La Poste understood to be one potential bidder.

HSBC is considering a similar move for its far smaller retail banking operation in Greece, where is has just 15 branches. Last year, the bank brought the Greek branches under central management in Paris as part of its licensing preparations for Brexit.

While the UK will not be hit as hard as the rest of Europe, around 10 per cent of the cuts are being proposed in London and at HSBC’s retail banking head office in Birmingham.



One source said: “Another big wave of cuts is being lined up for this coming summer. The bank is increasing focused on more profitable operations and looks like the balance of power will be very much tilted towards corporate banking and the Asian markets.”

41166,a9c5cc2dc03a3a4a5abeb1702caefa72,"Julián Castro launched his longshot bid nearly a year ago in his native San Antonio, hoping to excite a diverse coalition of voters who could power him to the White House.

© David Becker/Getty Images Julian Castro dropped out of the 2020 presidential race Thursday.

When he bowed out of the race Thursday, his allies expressed frustration that he was prevented from doing so, casting him as a victim of a primary process that inhibits candidates of color. In interviews, a half-dozen former aides and allies cast the first major Latino candidate in the 2020 race as a casualty of a system that already felled California Sen. Kamala Harris and is keeping New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker from gaining traction.

“How you fare in Iowa and New Hampshire sets the tone for how your campaign continues, and when you have these two states that in no way represent the diversity of the Democratic Party, it makes it very difficult for minority candidates to get momentum,” said Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, who noted the impact a campaign’s momentum — or lack thereof — has on fundraising, polling and media coverage.

“If you’ve got people like Booker and Kamala Harris and Castro campaigning in places like Texas, California and South Carolina early on, they’re gonna get momentum,” he argued. “They’re gonna get well known. They’re gonna start raising money. These were high-quality candidates and people who have credentials, who have a history of public service, who are smart, who have ideas and who I think represent where we’re at as a party on the issues important to Americans.”

With some two dozen candidates all vying for the Democratic nomination and party rules that emphasized national and early-state polling and grassroots fundraising to determine who could qualify for the sanctioned debates, Castro’s campaign had an uphill climb, some argued.

Black voters cast a majority of the Democratic primary vote in South Carolina and Hispanics make up a third of the population in Nevada. But the other two early states are overwhelmingly white.

Struggling to keep pace with his rivals in fundraising, Castro lacked the infrastructure and resources of the other Texan in the race, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who ended his campaign in November.

Castro saw his only polling bump when the two Texans clashed over immigration policy at the first debate in June, hitting 4 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post survey days later. In every other approved national and early-state poll released in 2019, however, Castro sat at 2 percent or less.

He cast himself as a voice for marginalized communities, releasing detailed policies on immigration, policing, lead exposure, indigenous communities, people with disabilities and animals while also meeting with inmates and touring a Las Vegas flood tunnel where homeless people seek shelter.

“Some of the people we targeted are people who literally don’t ever vote and could never get included in the political process, people like homeless people,” said a former aide who was laid off when the campaign shuttered its staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina to prioritize Iowa and Nevada.

“It’s tough because in places like Nevada, they rarely poll,” the ex-aide added. “The other issue is polling has always historically underpolled people of color and poor people, people who don’t have landlines. So when you make that system, so when the DNC basically says, ‘Oh, all right, this is how people are gonna qualify,’ you’re setting people up for failure.”

Mayra Macías, executive director of Latino Victory Fund, a progressive PAC that seeks to increase Latino political power and that endorsed Castro in August, said in her experience dealing with media, Castro’s candidacy was often written off. In her estimation, Castro fell victim to an electability argument that rewarded poll leaders in Iowa and New Hampshire with even higher polling and additional media coverage.

Castro never got significant media attention or polled above 2 percent in the first two early states.

“The bulk of the interviews that we’ve had have felt like almost a moratorium since Day One — folks bringing up a million and one reasons why his campaign wasn’t gonna be viable,” Macías lamented. “The mainstream coverage — or lack thereof — that his campaign received was a big factor, particularly because the campaign doesn’t have the resources as other campaigns do to get their message out there to the American people, so a lot of the campaign’s ability to reach out to folks really did depend on this earned media.”

Colin Strother, a Texas Democratic strategist who once advised Castro, said the system seems like it was “engineered” to make the primary a three-person race between the “three white septuagenarians” in former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont while preventing diverse candidates like Castro, Harris and Booker from reaching the goal line.

But Castro’s staff is also responsible for his demise, Strother said, blaming the candidate’s senior team for robbing their candidate of the opportunity “to get to Super Tuesday, when brown people and black people are finally gonna get a chance to vote.”

“They knew what the process was. At the end of the day, you’ve got to have a strategy to give your candidate a shot, and Julián’s staff didn’t,” he said. “They were spending money they shouldn’t have spent and pushing a strategy that they had to have a reasonable assumption wasn’t gonna work.”

Castro’s first campaign stop was Puerto Rico, instead of the traditional Iowa or New Hampshire. And two days after the DNC announced its polling thresholds for the first two debates — thresholds that hinged on performance in the four early states — Castro’s campaign announced a 50-state tour.

The ploy may have been a creative effort to help him clinch 65,000 unique donors since 200 of them each needed to come from at least 20 different states. But the time and resources spent on trips to states like Idaho and Utah could have been used to campaign or advertise in Iowa, Nevada or Super Tuesday states.

After spending more than half-a-million dollars more than it raised in the third quarter, the campaign entered October with less than $700,000 cash on hand. Later that month, Castro warned his supporters that his campaign needed $800,000 to stay alive in the next 10 days to stay alive, emulating a strategy that helped extend the life of Booker’s campaign.

Castro met the self-imposed deadline, but still lacked the resources to sustain an ad campaign that could boost his polling high enough to qualify for upcoming debates. He missed the last two in November and December, and the party rejected campaigns’ plea to allow more candidates to debate later this month.

When he was on the debate stage, Castro held his own, winning plaudits on the left for endorsing decriminalizing illegal border crossings, naming Atatiana Jefferson, a black woman who was shot and killed by a police officer in Texas, and mentioning transgender people when talking about abortion access.

“It’s a strong symbol when somebody can literally change the narrative on a few issues and not have the polling numbers but still the candidates on the stage also go toward that policy,” said another former aide who worked under Castro at HUD. “He pushed the envelope further than black and brown people have seen in a while.”

Castro acknowledged Thursday morning “that it simply isn’t our time” but also signaled that he isn’t leaving the political arena.

Allies say he belongs in the conversation for vice president, highlighting him as a young, progressive minority with executive experience who became mayor of a major city and ran a Cabinet department in the Obama administration.

They note he would be a valuable asset to any Democratic ticket and could see him serving in a Cabinet position under a Democratic administration, running for governor of Texas in 2022 or possibly even president again in 2024 if Donald Trump is reelected.

“I’m not afraid to admit that on more than one occasion I’ve asked each and both of those brothers to run for governor,” said Hinojosa, the Texas state party chairman, alluding to Julián and his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro.

But some Democrats warn that challenging Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is a fool’s errand because the state isn’t ready to put a Democrat in the governor’s mansion.

“He wasn’t really getting a lot of traction in Texas,” noted the aide who worked under Castro at HUD. “That’s a good symbol or sign that if you can’t even carry your own territory, how do you push against that narrative, that you’re strong enough or a viable candidate?”

Strother, the Democratic strategist, added that even after O’Rourke dropped out of the presidential race, the Texas Democratic community of donors, activists and elected officials didn’t coalesce behind Castro.

“If he couldn’t count on them in the biggest election of most of our lifetimes and in probably the modern history of the world, then I don’t think that he should expect that they’ll be there for him in a governor’s race,” Strother said, noting Abbott’s popularity and fundraising prowess.

In recent weeks, Castro had begun arguing for a greater focus on diversity on the front end of the primary calendar so that more people of color have more of a say in who ultimately becomes the nominee. No candidates of color this cycle have led polling in any of the four early states.

“A lot of people will point out and say, ‘Oh, but Barack Obama.’ Barack Obama is from Illinois, which is a bordering state to Iowa,” said the former aide who was downsized. “People in bordering states tend to do well, especially when you start sending volunteers. Right over the border isn’t that far. You talk about one exclusion, one exception. That’s not the rule. We have a lot of work to do as a Democratic Party to uplift our candidates [of color].”

Hinojosa, himself a Democratic Party leader, expressed frustration that the party’s system allowed a now-former mayor in Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., to become a front-runner at the expense of more qualified candidates of color.

“I don’t want to put down Pete Buttigieg, but give me a break. This guy never got more than 8,000 votes in any election,” Hinojosa said. “He’s a front-runner in Iowa versus these three other individuals? What the hell does that tell you?”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

41241,861286a673dce886ea5ffeb7bc44fdb4,"Attorneys representing Dominique White's parents in a lawsuit ignored the full context of the situation when they recently suggested White was ""guilty of only a misdemeanor"" before being fatally shot in September 2017 by two Topeka police officers, attorneys for those officers contended in a court document filed last week.

""White had lied about having a gun, did not comply with the order to 'lay down,' was reasonably suspected of having discharged a firearm in a populated area multiple times, and prevented (Topeka police officer Justin) Mackey from removing the gun,"" that document said. ""White's resistance under the totality of the circumstances would cause reasonable officers to suspect a serious crime had been committed.""

Attorneys David R. Cooper and J. Steven Pigg made that assertion in a document filed Dec. 26 as part of their continuing effort to have White's parents' lawsuit count against Topeka officers Justin Mackey and Michael Cruse decided in the officers' favor without a trial.

On-duty officers Mackey and Cruse fatally shot White, 30, after a struggle about 9:50 a.m. Sept. 28, 2017, near Ripley Park at S.E. 3rd and Lawrence.

District Attorney Mike Kagay said the officers questioned White, who denied he had a gun, then resisted them as they tried to seize a handgun from his left shorts pocket. White was then shot after running away from officers with his left hand hovering over the pocket containing the gun, Kagay said.

Mackey and Cruse were cleared of criminal wrongdoing. An internal police investigation concluded they committed no policy violations.

Andrew M. Stroth — managing director of the Action Injury Law Group, a Chicago-based firm that concentrates on police shooting cases nationwide — filed suit in June 2018 seeking more than $75,000 on each of two counts against Mackey, Cruse, Topeka's city government and five unnamed officers.

Plaintiffs in the suit are White's parents, Kelly White and Mary Wynne. Its first count contends Mackey and Cruse shot White without just cause. The second contends the city and its police department trained officers inadequately.

Molly Hadfield, the city’s media relations coordinator, said Thursday that the city doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Cooper and Pigg are seeking summary judgment in the case in favor of Mackey and Cruse on the first count while contending they are entitled to qualified immunity.

A summary judgment is a determination made by a court without a trial. Qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages if their conduct doesn’t violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.

Attorneys Stroth, Rick E. Bailey and Carlton Odim filed a motion Nov. 27 asking the court to deny Cooper and Pigg's motion for summary judgment. They wrote that Mackey and Cruse used lethal force though they were only investigating whether White fired a gun within Topeka city limits, which is a ""minor nonviolent misdemeanor.""

Cooper and Pigg contended in the document filed last week that that statement ignored the full context of the situation involved.

They also addressed an assertion by Stroth, Bailey and Odim that police body camera video showed Mackey and Cruse had already drawn their guns by the time Dominique White's left hand gestured toward the gun in his left shorts pocket.

""The reasonableness of the officers' use of force must be evaluated at the moment that the force is used, not when the weapon is drawn,"" Cooper and Pigg wrote. ""As the video demonstrates, drawing the gun to have it more quickly available to use does not equate to a decision to use it.""

Cooper and Pigg added that the body camera video shows ""that neither officer shot until after White appeared to reach for his gun.""", Bring lawsuit against ,3

The new year has arrived, and investors are left with a TSX Index that hit record highs to close out the previous year. In the 2010s, investors who put their faith in the markets were richly rewarded. The energy and materials-heavy TSX may not have had the explosiveness of indices like the S&P 500 south of the border, but there were still great opportunities.

Today, I want to look at three of my favourite dividend stocks to kick off the 2020s. Let’s jump in.

Genworth MI Canada

Canada’s housing sector enjoyed a resurgence in the middle of 2019, before sputtering a bit to finish the year. Genworth MI Canada (TSX:MIC) benefited from this rebound. The stock rose over 50% in the previous year. Over the past five years, it had achieved average annual returns of 13%.

The company released its third-quarter 2019 results in late October. Investors can expect to see its fourth-quarter and full-year results in early February. In Q3 2019, Genworth’s transactional premiums written rose 10% year over year to $213 million and total premiums written rose 11% to $218 million. This was largely due to growth in housing activity in the quarter.

Genworth last hiked its quarterly dividend payment to $0.54 per share. This represents a 3.8% yield. The company has delivered dividend growth for 10 consecutive years. Shares still boast a solid price-to-earnings ratio of 12 and a price-to-book value of 1.2. This is a dividend stock worth holding onto over the next decade.

Enbridge

Enbridge (TSX:ENB)(NYSE:ENB) is a heavy hitter in the energy sector. It is the third-largest stock on the TSX by market cap. Shares climbed over 25% in 2019 in the face of continued turbulence in its industry. Enbridge has posted impressive operational success in recent quarters and came out of 2018 and 2019 scoring several regulatory wins.

In the third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.12 billion, or $0.56 per share, compared to $933 million, or $0.55 per share, in the prior year. Year to date Enbridge posted adjusted EBITDA of $10 billion over $9.5 billion in the first three quarters of 2018. Investors can expect to see its fourth-quarter and full-year results for the previous year next month.

The company last announced a quarterly dividend of $0.738 per share. This represents a strong 6.2% yield. It has delivered dividend growth for over 20 consecutive years. The stock is trading close to its 52-week high, but its P/E of 17 and P/B of 1.7 is stands in good territory relative to its industry peers.

Hydro One

Top utility stocks rewarded investors nicely in 2019. In the beginning of 2018, I’d discussed why a soft rate environment was a positive one for this sector. Hydro One (TSX:H) struggled, as the Bank of Canada underwent a brief rate-tightening path in 2017 and 2018, but it gained considerable momentum last year. The stock rose 28% in 2019.

In the year-to-date period at the end of Q3 2019, Hydro One reported revenues of $4.76 billion compared to $4.65 billion in 2018. Adjusted basic earnings per share rose to $1.19 compared to $1.06 in the prior year. Less-favourable weather offset lower OM&A costs, which led to lower revenues in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018.

Hydro One last paid out a quarterly dividend of $0.2415 per share. This represents a 3.8% yield. The company has delivered a dividend increase in every year since its IPO in late 2015."," Threaten, not specified below",3

41383,c59e59c30b60481cc211a4ad49721eb9,"Please explain your legal background and why you are qualified to be a judge.

I have dedicated my 20-year career to protecting the public and seeking justice for victims of crime. I graduated from Stanford University and the University of San Diego School of Law (with honors). As deputy district attorney, I handled serious felony cases involving domestic violence, rape, child molestation, kidnapping, carjacking and arson. I was a recognized expert in the field of drug facilitated sexual assault. I fought to prevent sex offenders classified as sexually violent predators from being released back into our communities.

I now serve as senior chief deputy city attorney in charge of Criminal Division Operations. I have prosecuted more than 40 manslaughter cases. I supervise more than 70 prosecutors and I’ve served as chief deputy for the General Trial, Appellate and Special Prosecution units. My office implemented new criminal justice programs designed to reduce homelessness and curb gun violence.

I thoroughly understand state court trial work. I’ve tried dozens of cases to jury verdict and never had a case overturned on appeal. I also taught trial advocacy as a law school professor.

Why are you seeking this position?

My experience and fairness make me the best candidate for Superior Court Judge. The Preamble to the Code of Judicial Ethics states as follows: “Our legal system is based on the principle that an independent, fair and competent judiciary will interpret and apply the laws that govern us.”

This judicial election is for a Superior Court judge, whose responsibility is to preside over state court civil and criminal proceedings. To faithfully and competently execute that duty, the best training for a state court judge is to have litigated state court cases on a regular basis. The federal statutes related to criminal law and procedure are not applied to cases heard by a Superior Court judge. I have a distinguished record of 20 years of experience as a state court prosecutor and know the law to be applied by a Superior Court judge.

I have a reputation for fairness which is why I am the only candidate for Office 22 who is endorsed by an association of prosecutors, state court defense attorneys and Superior Court judges.

What one criminal justice reform is most needed or are you content with the criminal justice system as it is?

Judges must work with prosecutors, defense attorneys and treatment professionals to create new ways to slow the rise of homelessness, drug use, and mental health illness. A recent report from SANDAG included data from adult arrestees in the San Diego region. Some troubling findings include the following: 1) the median age of homelessness is 26 and drug use was a leading cause, 2) methamphetamine use is rising, and 3) drug use for adult females is at the highest rate for women since the study began in 2000. Proposition 47 was supposed to provide more resources for treatment. Instead, the revolving door at the jail results in individuals being released before a meaningful opportunity to engage in treatment. So my office created the S.M.A.R.T. Program, which provides wraparound services to chronic offenders and offers substance abuse treatment and housing, along with medical care, mental health treatment and job training. This program reaches people not otherwise monitored by the Probation Department and has shown immediate improvement in treatment and quality of life for participants, including military veterans.

The state Supreme Court is weighing an amendment to the judicial Code of Ethics that would allow a judge to publicly oppose a judicial candidate. The code now only allows judges to endorse for a judicial office. Do you support or oppose such a change?

I would not support an amendment that allows a sitting judge to publicly oppose a judicial candidate. Public opposition from a judge will undermine the public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary and create grounds for disqualification. Judges must not engage in activity that brings the appearance of bias. Canon 2 of the California Code of Judicial Ethics states that a judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. Imagine that the judicial candidate wins the election despite the public criticism. How would a future litigant have confidence in a judge after their personal or professional qualifications were besmirched? Now imagine the opposite scenario, wherein the judicial candidate loses the election and may have an appearance before that same judge. California Code of Civil Procedure section 170.1(a)(6)(B) would prompt the disqualification of a Superior Court Judge from hearing a case: “Bias or prejudice toward a lawyer in the proceeding may be grounds for disqualification.” Neither outcome is a good thing for our judiciary.

41462,0d2759b1109d4a3253e849c366993940,"ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Thursday said that global bodies and allies have been alerted about the threats from India.

Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui in her maiden weekly media briefing said that Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had written to UN Secretary General António Guterres and Security Council president Kelly Craft “comprehensively” apprising them about the threats to Pakistan due to intensified ceasefire violations and deployment of Indian troops along the Line of Control.

“We have shared our concerns and fears with international organisations and our partners as well,” she added.

Tensions between the troubled neighbours spiked sharply after Delhi annexed occupied Kashmir on Aug 5, 2019 by revoking the valley’s special constitutional status and remain high ever since because of the situation in the occupied region.

Indian army chief’s remarks denounced as reckless

Ongoing widespread protests in India against the controversial citizenship law and the National Register of Citizens renewed fears of Indian aggression. It is suspected that the Indian government may undertake a diversionary misadventure against Pakistan because of its worsening internal situation. Those concerns were strengthened by the deployment of missiles along the LoC and extra-ordinary movement of Indian troops.

The new Indian army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane further ratcheted up the tensions in his first media interview soon after assuming the command in which he said: “If Pakistan does not stop its policy of state-sponsored terrorism, we reserve the right to pre-emptively strike at the sources of terror threat and this intent has adequately been demonstrated in our response during surgical strikes and Balakot Operation.”

The FO in a separate statement denounced Gen Naravane’s statement as reckless.

“We reject the new Indian Army Chief’s irresponsible statement regarding “pre-emptive strikes” across the LoC inside Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK).”

The FO said that the Indian leadership should not be mistaken “about Pakistan’s resolve and readiness to thwart against any aggressive Indian move, inside its territory or AJK”.

The Indian army chief was reminded of Pakistan’s “befitting” response to “Balakot misadventure” in which two of their jets were downed and one of the pilots Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured. The pilot was released days later amidst international efforts to defuse the stand-off.

Spokesperson Farooqui said that Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts have exposed Indian government’s agenda for promoting Hindu nationalism at the cost of religious minorities. “The global community is now awakened to the threat to regional peace and security that the Hindutva driven policies of Indian government poses,” she maintained.

Responding to a question about the possibility of an OIC meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, she said: “We are working to optimally utilise all the OIC mechanisms to highlight the worsening human rights and humanitarian situation in the IOJK. In this context, a special session of OIC Foreign Ministers’ is also envisaged, for which work remains in progress.”

Jan. 2 -- ANDOVER -- Attorneys who represent victims of the Columbia Gas disaster in a controversial class-action lawsuit will be holding a series of ""town halls"" over the next few weeks to help people file claims in the suit against the utility company.

""We are planning to hold three town hall meetings to help people file claims and answer any questions,"" said Elizabeth Graham , one of the attorneys in the case. ""Anyone who was impacted by this event is encouraged to file a claim -- even if they already filed a claim through insurance or through the Columbia Gas -managed process.""

She added, ""This is real money and it's easy to file a claim. An average family of four could get a lump sum payment of $1,050 to $9,500 based on the severity of disruption caused by the incident.""

The $143 million settlement will pay claims for major losses, as well as any minor inconveniences experienced. This includes evacuations, evacuation expenses, loss of gas service, heating expenses, lost wages, lost business income, property damage and emotional distress.

The deadline to file claims related to the 2018 Columbia Gas over-pressurization event has been extended by court order to Jan. 31 . Originally the deadline was Jan. 9 , but residents and business owners claimed they needed more time because of the holidays.

All town halls will be held on Saturdays in January from 12 noon to 5 p.m. on the following days: Jan. 4 , Jan. 18 and Jan. 25 . Both English- and Spanish-speaking agents will be on hand to assist and answer questions regarding the filing process.

The meetings will be held the Greater Lawrence Technical High School , 57 River Road , Andover .

All residents who attend the sessions should bring proof of residency in the areas affected by the Sept. 13, 2018 blasts and fires. Proof includes utility bills, pay stubs, cell phone bills or lease agreements, for example.

For more information, call 833-927-0819 or visit ColumbiaGasExplosionSettlement.com.

Not everyone is on board with the class-action suit.

Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera earlier this week released a letter saying he believes the settlement should be nullified.

""I am of the opinion that the settlement terms are unfair and unreasonable,"" he said in a letter dated Nov. 9, 2019 . The deadline to file objections to the class-action suit with the settlement administrator was Dec. 10, 2019 .

The reason Rivera objects to the suit, he said, is that the attorneys' fees proposed as part of the settlement are too high, the time frame to apply for compensation under the settlement is too short, and the claims process is too complicated.

He isn't the only one objecting to the proposed settlement.

A group of residents who formerly lived in a multi-family home at 6-12 Springfield St. filed an objection to the settlement, saying they suffered mental and physical distress when their apartment building burned in the disaster.

The Sept. 13, 2018 gas disaster, caused by over-pressurization of gas lines, affected residents and businesses in Andover , North Andover and Lawrence . Leonel Rondon , 18, of Lawrence , was killed, dozens of people were injured and damages are estimated at $1 billion .

Three firefighters and 19 civilians were hurt, 50,000 people were forced to evacuate, and the severity of the damage largely depended on the age of appliances people had. Five homes were destroyed and 131 structures damaged, according to findings by the National Transportation Safety Board .

The settlement could benefit roughly 175,000 residents and businesses and allows for six categories of lump-sum payouts, ranging from $50 for a ""nominal"" disruption to as much as $15,000 for a ""major"" disruption.

Famagusta District Court Judge Michalis Papathanasiou said the defendant didn’t tell the truth and tried to deceive the court with “evasive” statements in her testimony.

PARALIMNI, Cyprus — A Cyprus court on Monday found a 19-year-old British woman guilty of fabricating claims that she was gang raped by 12 Israelis in a hotel room at a tourist resort in the east Mediterranean island nation, saying her story lacked credibility.

The case had triggered widespread interest in Britain and Israel. It was reported as a shocking gang rape until Cypriot authorities cast doubt on the woman’s account.

Reacting to the verdict, the British government raised questions over whether the teenager received a fair trial.

“The UK is seriously concerned about the fair trial guarantees in this deeply distressing case, and we will be raising the issue with the Cypriot authorities,’’ a Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said in a written statement.

The woman, who has not been identified, was found guilty of the charge of “public mischief,” which carries a maximum fine of $1,900 and up to a year’s imprisonment. She will remain in Cyprus for her Jan. 7 sentencing.

The woman told investigators that she had been raped by as many as a dozen Israelis aged 15-20 on July 17. Cyprus police said she retracted the allegations 10 days later after investigators found what they said were inconsistencies in her statements.

Taking the stand at the trial, the British woman said that while she was having sex with her boyfriend, she was pinned down, and others who entered the room raped her.

The judge said the defendant admitted to investigators under questioning that she had lied and apologized. He said she made up the claims because she was “ashamed’’ after finding out that some of the Israelis had videoed her having consensual sex with her Israeli boyfriend on their mobile phones. He said that the admission and her subsequent apology “was the only time the defendant told the truth.”

The court heard that a physical examination of the woman after she filed the complaint to police found no evidence of rape.

WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A U.S. strike killed Iran Quds Force chief Qassem Soleimani, the Pentagon said on Thursday, adding that Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack Americans in Iraq and the Middle East.

""At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani,"" a Pentagon statement said.

""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,"" it said, adding that the United States would continue to take necessary action to protect Americans and interests around the world.

The Pentagon statement said that Soleimani had ""orchestrated"" attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the past few months and approved the ""attacks"" on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.

U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Soleimani had been killed in a drone strike in Baghdad.

One U.S. official said that Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also believed to have been killed in the strike, though he was not the primary target.

The official said it was aware of the possibility of an Iranian response and U.S. military officials were ready to defend themselves. The official did not rule out additional U.S. troops or military assets going to the region.

41815,f2122dd54b3faca90069efd99616b20f,"Kentucky’s new Republican attorney general has asked the FBI to investigate a flurry of pardons by former Gov. Matt Bevin.

The pardons have drawn criticism from both sides of the political aisle after media reports highlighted some that went to convicts who had wealthy or politically connected families.

Atty. Gen. Daniel Cameron wrote in a letter Monday that he had sent a formal request to the FBI to “investigate this matter.”

“I believe the pardon power should be used sparingly and only after great deliberation with due concern for public safety,” Cameron wrote in the letter addressed to two Democratic state lawmakers, who shared the letter Thursday.

Bevin, a Republican, issued hundreds of pardons between his electoral defeat on Nov. 5 and his final day in office on Dec. 9. His pardons included clemency for convicted killer Patrick Baker, whose family held a fundraiser for Bevin in 2018, and a convicted sex offender whose mother was married to a millionaire road contractor.

The pardons also have attracted the attention of Russell Coleman, the U.S. attorney for Kentucky’s Western District.

On Monday, Coleman said his office would review any pardon-related issues brought by state prosecutors or other law enforcement partners.

“I am particularly concerned about the risk to the public by those previously convicted of sex offenses, who by virtue of the state pardon, will not fall under any post-release supervision or be required to register as sex offenders,” Coleman said at a news conference.

Coleman was probably referring to the pardon of Micah Schoettle, convicted of raping a 9-year-old girl, who was in the second year of a 23-year prison sentence when Bevin pardoned him of rape, sodomy and other sexual crimes. The pardon also removed him from the state’s sex offender registry.

Bevin has said in defending the Schoettle pardon that there should have been physical evidence of rape and in his pardoning document he wrote that the prosecution of the case was “sloppy at best.”

Cameron, who took office Dec. 17, was responding to requests by two state lawmakers, Sen. Morgan McGarvey and Rep. Chris Harris, who were particularly concerned about the Baker case.

Baker was sentenced to 19 years in prison on convictions of reckless homicide and other crimes in a fatal 2014 home break-in in Knox County. Prosecutors say Baker and another man posed as police to gain entry to Donald Mills’ home and shot Mills in front of his wife. Bevin wrote in his pardoning order that Baker’s drug addictions led him to fall in with the wrong people and the evidence against Baker was “sketchy at best.”

Advertisement

The Courier Journal has reported that Baker’s family held a fundraiser at their home for Bevin in 2018, and another GOP donor who gave thousands to Bevin urged the former governor to pardon Baker.

The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Baker’s conviction a year ago, writing in a unanimous ruling that “Baker’s guilt was overwhelming.”", Sexually assault,3

A British teenager found guilty of lying about being gang-raped in Cyprus has pleaded with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to “please bring me home”.

The 19-year-old alleged she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in the party town of Ayia Napa on July 17.

But she has said Cypriot police forced her to sign a retraction statement which led to her being convicted of public mischief at Famagusta District Court, in Paralimni.

“Every second of this ordeal has been a waking nightmare,” the woman, who has not been named, said.

“I’m 19 and all I want to do is clear my name and come home to my family,” she added in quotes reported by The Sun.

“I would say to both the Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister, both of whom are fathers, please support me with your actions, not just with your words.”

The paper also reported that the Foreign Office had on Thursday contacted the teenager’s family for the first time since she was convicted.

A FO spokeswoman told PA news agency in a statement that the UK was “seriously concerned” about the “fair trial guarantees in this deeply distressing case and we will be raising the issue with Cypriot authorities”.

A number of prominent legal figures in Cyprus have also written to attorney general Costas Clerides urging him to intervene in the case.

The group includes former justice minister Kypros Chrysostomides, who told the BBC the woman involved had “already suffered a lot” and he expected her sentence would be “very lenient”.

“She has already been in detention for four-and-a-half weeks and she has been prevented from travelling for about five months already,” he said.

But the government of Cyprus has said it has “full confidence in the justice system and the courts”.

Meanwhile, the teenager’s mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has backed calls for a tourism boycott of the country.

“The place isn’t safe – it is absolutely not safe. And if you go and report something that’s happened to you, you’re either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what’s happened to my daughter may happen,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

The woman said her daughter was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations, and is sleeping for up to 20 hours a day because of a condition called hypersomnia.

“She needs to get back to the UK to get that treated – that’s my absolute primary focus. She can’t be treated here because hearing foreign men speaking loudly will trigger an episode,” she said.

“It needs resolving otherwise she’s going to carry on having this for the rest of her life.”

An online crowdfunding appeal to raise money for legal support for the woman’s daughter has passed £120,000, exceeding its £105,000 goal.

The “help teen victim get justice in Cyprus” GoFundMe page was set up by British lawyer John Hobbs in August to raise cash for the 19-year-old’s legal representation.

The woman has been on bail since the end of August, after spending a month in prison, and could face up to a year in jail and a 1,700 euro (£1,500) fine when she is sentenced on January 7.", Sexually assault,3

Decatur County, TN – The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), along with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are investigating a shooting of a bald eagle in West Tennessee. The injured eagle was reported on December 30th, 2019 around 3:00pm in Decatur County. A $2,500 reward is being offered for an arrest.

The eagle was found off Martins Landing Road in Bath Springs. TWRA wildlife officer Brant Luker responded to the call and the bald eagle was transported alive, but injured to the North Madison Animal Hospital on December 31st.

After examination, it was determined the eagle had been shot. Injuries sustained were incurable and the animal was euthanized.

Bald eagles historically ranged throughout most of North America. However, for environmental reasons and a lack of regulations, their numbers dwindled in the 1900s. Bald eagles were placed on the endangered species list in 1978.

Eagle populations recovered after changes in environmental practices and protection and the endangered status was removed in 2007.

However, bald eagles are still protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Violations of these statutes carry a maximum criminal penalty of up to $100,000.00 and/or one year in federal prison. State charges will also apply.

Bald eagles are biparental, meaning it takes both parent birds to raise young. Losing one eagle likely means failure of a nest.

And the news is similarly worrying for Saturday, with temperatures across the already-stricken areas of eastern Victoria, the NSW southern ranges and the south coast set to climb to the 40s with north-westerly winds ahead of a cool change.

Ms Osborne said it was a ""similar synoptic set up to New Year's Eve"" when ferocious bushfires ripped through many communities, leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake.

""Winds will be strongest along the coastal fringe, resulting in erratic fire behaviour and (a) shifting direction of fire fronts with the wind change, which should be over the Shoalhaven by early evening and Sydney by midnight,"" she said.

Iran says U.S. will bear responsibility for the consequences of the killiings

The top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards-Quds Force, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, was assassinated in an airstrike just outside of the Baghdad airport shortly after midnight Thursday. The strike, which was ordered by President Donald Trump following the siege of the U.S. embassy in the Iraqi capital by members of Iranian-backed Shiite militias, also killed senior commanders of the militias, known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF).

Gen. Soleimani is widely recognized as the orchestrator of Iran's strategy to influence and shape Middle East politics through a string of proxy militias. His presence in Baghdad soon after the embassy siege is being linked to his control of the events.

Updated at 08:05 am EST, Jan. 3: President Trump, who had tweeted out the picture of the American flag soon after the news of the air strike broke, tweeted early morning Friday: ""Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!""

The U.S. embassy in Baghdad said all public consular operations are suspended until further notice. It added in a Facebook post that the U.S. Consulate General in Erbil is open for visa and American Citizen Services appointments.

Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a visit to Greece and is heading back to Israel.

""The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,"" he said in a tweet.

President Trump has not commented directly on the assassination but tweeted an American flag after the news broke.

Update at 22:59 EST: Lt. Chris Miller, a combat controller with the U.S. Air Force stationed in the Middle East, welcomed the killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani. He told International Business Times: ""The s**t will hit the fan for a month or so, but Iran as a whole will rise up. The youth will take power. We didn't start a war we finished several. We killed the serpent and now the region can heal.""

General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months - including the attack on December 27th - culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel.

The source, who is with the Iraqi security forces and wished to remain anonymous, told International Business Times that the rockets detonated simultaneously and appeared to target a convoy of vehicles that were outside of a facility that housed American and Iraqi counter-terrorism forces. He said Mohammed Redha Al-Jabri, a senior Popular Mobilization Force official, was also killed along with his associates. In all, the strike killed eight people.

The precision of the strikes pointed to a possible U.S. role, the source said. If that is confirmed, the strike would mark a sharp escalation in the tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The U.S. military scrambled helicopters following the attack soon after midnight, he said.

A source with the U.S. special operations community in Iraq said separately: ""There are indications that the attack was staged as the vehicles that were hit were in motion, the precision that the strike was carried out with could have been the work of a drone if you know what I mean?""

The PMF, or the Hashed as it is known, is an umbrella organization of various Iraqi Shiite militias backed by Iran. During the war, in 2016, the PMF was made into an independent military force reporting directly to the Iraqi prime minister.

The Quds Force is an arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Forces engaged in carrying out unconventional warfare across the world. Members of the Quds Force fought alongside the PMF against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

The Quds Force is also widely considered to be behind the many recent attacks in Syria and Iraq against U.S. forces and the attack that targeted oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.

The Quds Force is reported to have used the war against the Islamic State and the recent popular unrest in Iraq to smuggle in and hide ballistic missiles in Iraq and Syria. Those missiles are considered a threat to U.S. forces and allies if a shooting war breaks out with Iran, and also to Israel.

Israeli military jets have previously targeted Iranian facilities and weapons stockpiles in Syria.

The strike that took out Gen. Soleimani follows the recent siege on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad by pro-Iranian protesters Tuesday, Dec. 31. Tensions in the area have remained high as 750 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne division were sent to Kuwait shortly after the attack.

The siege was carried out in retaliation for U.S. air strikes on Iranian weapons caches in Iraq and Syria, following an attack on an U.S. base that killed an American contractor.

The Popular Mobilisation Front had given the call for the siege, saying it was a ""message"" to the Americans. President Donald Trump acted decisively following the siege and even threatened Iran that it will be held responsible for any damage to U.S. interests.", Accuse of aggression,3

""The deputy head of the Hashed, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and head of the Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, were killed in a US strike that targeted their car on the Baghdad International Airport road,"" Iraqi media quoted the Iraqi pro-government group as saying in a statement.

42256,6ffbf8fbbbbeb0f1934c855e23f60776,"Time for Insider-Threat Programs to Grow Up

Immature programs attempting to protect against damaging attacks by insiders run the risk of alienating employees.

The vast majority of companies have embarked on establishing an insider-threat program, but most struggle to create mature processes for detecting and responding to employee-created risk.

In its Insider Threat Report published last year, for example, Crowd Research Partners found that while 86% of organizations had embarked on creating a program, most were still developing the policies and programs, and only a third of all companies considered their insider-threat program to be mature.

The stakes can be high for companies: A badly implemented insider-threat program can alienate employees if they feel their privacy is being compromised by too much monitoring or that management is too quick to suspect workers of foul play. In a research paper published this week, Forrester Research found that many of the current insider-threat programs may violate new privacy laws and the more draconian programs may undercut employee performance, says Joseph Blankenship, vice president of research for Forrester.

""If you get the response wrong, and that employee goes out and gets a lawyer, you open yourself up to a world of hurt,"" he says. ""So finding the right response and protecting employee's privacy are the most important aspect of an insider threat program.""

Blankenship sees 2020 as the year that many companies will get insider-threat protection right by focusing not only on risk reduction, but privacy, transparency, and employee experience. While most financial service firms and any company dealing with sensitive data may already have mature processes in place to detect insider abuse, most other companies are not so well-prepared, he says.

""2020 will be the year that we take the insider-threat function from ad-hoc to something that is repeatable and improvable,"" Blankenship says. ""Many other companies are realizing that they have to provide some rigor around this.""

Driven by a rise in inquiries from clients, Forrester conducted the research that formed the basis of the report. Different businesses need different approaches to insider threats, he says. A military contractor that faces nation-state actors has a different risk profile and a different insider-threat program than a retailer which has to protect payment card data.

Yet, businesses should not let paranoia undermine their business. While by its very nature an insider-threat program views employees as potential threats, organizations need to work with employees and put them first.

Be Transparent

Transparency is key, according to Forrester's report. Organizations need to clearly define their programs and the roles that employees have in helping companies secure their valuable assets. Under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), employees have the right to be informed about how employers are using their information, the right to correct inaccurate information, and the right to be forgotten.

By notifying employees of what information the company collects, and what the purpose of that collection is, the organization educates workers and makes them part of the team. About 82% of companies train employees on ways to minimize cybersecurity risk, according to Crowd Research Partners' insider threat report.

In addition to education, companies need to make sure that security programs in general - and an insider-threat program specifically - do not undermine productivity. About 7% of information workers circumvent the policies that companies haave in place for security, often citing a need to do their tasks more efficiently (39%) or the unreasonable restrictions of the security policies (34%), according to Forrester's report.

""Security people might consider this a human-resources problem, but HR is not the place where it should be housed,"" he says.

Proper training and using cross-functional teams to establish policy can help. The most important piece is how the company responds to any potentially malicious or damaging behavior, Blankenship says.

While the daily migration figure is slightly less bullish than state leaders have been heralding, it could nonetheless bolster their case for a decade-long plan to build three new toll roads up and down the Florida Peninsula.

Here's five questions asked and answered regarding the plan, what the roads would connect, why critics are up in arms over the proposal, and what its likely future in the Florida legislature might be:

1. Where would the toll roads go?

Part of the so-called M-CORES project approved by the Florida Legislature in 2019, the three roads would extend the Suncoast Parkway from Citrus County to the Georgia state line; connect the Suncoast with the Florida Turnpike; and link Polk County with Collier County.

2. Why are they needed?

According to supporters, including Senate President Bill Galvano (R-Bradenton), the rapid increase in Florida's population will necessitate infrastructure improvements to ease growing traffic congestion.

By providing ways for motorists to bypass the state's main interstate highways, they say it will be much easier for people to get around.

3. What population growth figures have M-CORES proponents been citing?

Galvano and others have said 900 people are moving to Florida each day, a figure in line with forecasts developed by state economists. While the Census' finding that an average of 640 people moved to Florida each day in 2019 is somewhat lower, it still represents significant growth.

In 2019 alone, the state's population grew by more than 223,000 people, second only to Texas.

4. What does the finding mean for critics?

Opponents of the toll roads are warning that building them could decimate some of Florida's most ecologically-sensitive areas and exacerbate urban sprawl. The Census' confirmation that the state's population is, indeed, booming could dilute the impact of the critics' arguments, underscoring the urgency of the infrastructure problem.

5. What happens next?

When the 2020 legislative session convenes January 14, lawmakers will begin considering whether to approve the next round of funding for M-CORES. Under the timeline approved by the legislature last year, completion of the toll roads is envisioned no later than 2030."," Threaten, not specified below",3

A criminal complaint states authorities noted the victim appeared to be ""withdrawn and unassertive"" during a face-to-face interview and later learned the victim was diagnosed with borderline intellectual functioning.

According to the criminal complaint, the victim told police she left her job late the night before and rode a bus to the Brooklyn Center Transit Center to catch an additional bus to get home. Two males, a juvenile and Gbassie, then approached her and offered her a ride home. The victim reluctantly agreed, and the two then said they first needed to make a stop at Gbassie's apartment and convinced her to come up to the unit with them. Once inside, they pushed the victim down and began fondling and kissing her.

The complaint states the victim told the two to stop, but they continued and turned up the volume on music to drown out her screams. Gbassie then allegedly restrained the victim while the juvenile undressed and then raped the victim. Gbassie also sexually assaulted the victim.

Afterward, the two drove the victim home. The complaint states after the victim exited their vehicle, she bent down and pretended to tie her shoes, but instead took a picture of the vehicle's license plate.

The victim then told her aunt about the assault, and her aunt called 911. Minneapolis police responded and noted the victim's eyes were puffy from crying, her hair was in disarray, and her pants were torn. They also took a report of the assault before the victim was transported to a hospital for a sexual assault examination.

Using the picture of the vehicle's license plate, police found and arrested Gbassie on Sept. 11, 2018. The complaint states Gbassie called the victim the other male's girlfriend and that when they went back to the apartment, the other male and the victim were in the bedroom together, but he wasn't and didn't know what happened.

Police later obtained search warrants for Gbassie's DNA, cellphone, apartment and bedding, and later found the other male suspect and arrested him. DNA from the sexual assault examination matched the juvenile's, the complaint states.

Then, in November 2018, two girls reported being sexually abused. In June 2019, one of the juvenile girls disclosed to a therapist that Gbassie sexually abused her.

A criminal complaint states the girls told authorities Gbassie put his genitals in their mouths regularly when they were alone or when everyone else was asleep. They also told authorities Gbassie threatened to kill them if they told anyone.

Gbassie denied the allegations in an interview with police on Aug. 30, 2019.

Are they thinking of starting World War 3 or has it already begun some while back?

German, U.S. Envoys Join Poland In War Of Words With Russia.

The U.S. and German ambassadors to Poland have taken to social media to defend Warsaw in its spat with Russia over who was to blame for starting World War II.

German envoy Rolf Nikel and U.S. Ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher both said on December 30 that Germany and the Soviet Union colluded to start the war in 1939 that led to the death of tens of millions of people on continental Europe.

“Dear President [Vladimir] Putin,” Mosbacher said, Adolf Hitler of Germany and Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union “colluded to start WWII.”

She said, “that is a fact” and that “Poland was a victim of this horrible conflict.”

Nikel said his government’s position was clear: “the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact served to prepare the criminal invasion of Nazi Germany against Poland. The USSR together with Germany participated in this brutal division of Poland.”

Their statements on social-media came after Putin blamed Poland for provoking the start of the war in which 6 million Poles were killed, or 17 percent of the country’s pre-war population.

The Soviet Union suffered an estimated 20 million war deaths, half of whom were civilians, representing some 11 percent of its population.

The verbal brawl over the competing historical narratives reignited on December 19 when Putin at a news conference denied that the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union was sealed in preparation for war.

EU Resolution

Earlier, in September, he denounced a European Parliament resolution that concluded the Soviet Union bore partial responsibility for WWII, alongside Germany.

The EU resolution said the pact set out to divide Europe “between the two totalitarian regimes” of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

Putin dismissed the resolution as “sheer nonsense.”

Instead the Russian president said Poland was culpable for the outbreak of World War II, words that Russia’s Foreign Ministry also repeated in December.

In response, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki issued a four-page statement accusing Putin of “deliberately” lying about the start of WWII in an effort to deflect international pressure over Moscow’s actions, both domestic and foreign.

“President Putin has lied about Poland on numerous occasions, and he has always done it deliberately,” Morawiecki said. “It usually happens in a situation when the authorities in Moscow feel international pressure caused by its actions. And this pressure is not on the historical stage but on the modern geopolitical scene.”

This year in May, Russia will celebrate the 75th anniversary of victory in WWII in events that are expected to feature much fanfare with heads of state and other dignitaries in attendance."," Threaten non-force, not specified below",3

Chief presidential Legal Counsel and spokesman Salvador Panelo stressed that the President is serious in his pronouncement recently that he will file syndicated estafa against Manila Water and Maynilad.

“If the President said it, he will push through with it,” Panelo said Thursday.

“The very evidence is the contract itself…he’s been saying it mirrors the provisions of the anti-graft. All they did was against the anti-graft (law),” he added.

Panelo stressed that as chief enforcer of laws, it is the duty of the President to uphold them.

“Remember that the President is the chief enforcer of laws, and that is his duty. He would be reneging from his duty if he does not do that,” he pointed out.

From the very beginning we are paying for water treatment and they should establish a facility, that has been going on but they failed to build a facility.

In a speech before victims of earthquake in Cotabato on 30 December, Mr. Duterte threatened to file syndicated estafa or plunder against Pangilinan and Fernando Zobel de Ayala.

The President even warned that he would order the military to take over operations.

Cause of dismay



Panelo also said that the President is disappointed over the water concessionaries failure to build water treatment facilities despite collecting fees from the consumers since 1997 or when the concession agreements were signed.

“From the very beginning we are paying for water treatment and they should establish a facility, that has been going on but they failed to build a facility,” Panelo pointed out.

“The President is not even referring to future projects…from the start, they (water companies) should have put up facilities (but) you did not do. Meanwhile, you were charging us, the consumers,” he added.

Meanwhile, Panelo assured that the President is ready to scrap any onerous provisions, if there are any, in the contract to construct Kaliwa Dam.

Dam deal review up



He made the remark when asked to comment about pronouncements made by Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate that the project would be a “disaster” for the country.

In fact, according to Panelo, the President is willing to personally review the project just to make sure that there are no onerous provisions contained in the contract.

“That goes without saying that the President, if someone points out to him that there is an onerous provision, he will immediately look into it. If it manages to pass through from those who should look into it, he himself will look into it,” Panelo said.

Mr. Duterte threatened to file syndicated estafa or plunder against Pangilinan and Fernando Zobel de Ayala.

“Yes, you can remove the onerous provision, you can still continue with the contract,” he added.

Panelo, however, expressed belief that those who drafted the agreement know exactly whether or not those provisions will be disadvantageous to the government.

“So, since it was approved, I’m sure there were checks done if its disadvantageous or not,” the palace spokesman said.

“If the President sees it as one-sided, just like in water, he does not like onerous provisions then it’s canceled.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

The group includes former justice minister Kypros Chrysostomides, who told the BBC the woman involved had “already suffered a lot” and he expected her sentence would be “very lenient”.

“She has already been in detention for four-and-a-half weeks and she has been prevented from travelling for about five months already,” he said.

But the government of Cyprus has said it has “full confidence in the justice system and the courts”.

The woman said her daughter was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations, and is sleeping for up to 20 hours a day because of a condition called hypersomnia.

The shooting early Wednesday happened after a dispute between people and was not a targeted attack, police said. Those wounded are in stable condition.

Huntington Police Chief Ray Cornwell said in a media release that shooting victims were found inside and outside of the bar, according to the Associated Press.

According to WOWK-TV, more than a dozen shell casings were found outside the bar and in a parking lot across the street. About 50 people were inside the bar when police arrived.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called off his planned trip to Ukraine to deal with a crisis at the embassy in Baghdad. Pro-Iranian militia members tried to storm that embassy earlier this week. That is just one of the foreign policy challenges facing the Trump administration in the new year.

NPR State Department correspondent Michele Kelemen is tracking all of them. She joins me now. Hi, Michele.

MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.

KELLY: Start with Baghdad. And what is the situation now? What's the latest?

KELEMEN: So those pro-Iranian militia members and their supporters have dispersed. The Trump administration's beefing up security, but this is clearly not over. I mean, remember; this whole thing started when an Iranian-backed militia fired on a U.S. base in Iraq and killed an American contractor. The U.S. retaliated, and the Iranian-backed group said 24 of its members were killed. So this is a situation that has been escalating.

KELLY: And what is the administration doing to try to de-escalate and reverse that?

KELEMEN: Well, they say that their goal, really, is to restore deterrence. They've been talking tough toward Iran. President Trump tweeted on New Year's Eve that Iran will be held responsible for any lives lost. They will pay a very big price, he wrote, adding, this is not a warning; it's a threat.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper was asked about that tweet on Fox News today. Take a listen.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARK ESPER: We have vast capability to do any number of things. We will act in response to actions by Iran or its proxies, and we will act to preempt any attacks on our forces, our personnel by Iran or its proxies.

KELEMEN: And remember, Mary Louise, after pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, the Trump administration began this maximum-pressure policy, claiming that it's working. However, we've seen more attacks on U.S. interests from Iran in recent months.

KELLY: Let me turn you to North Korea, which is also not having a quiet start to the year. Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader - he was warning yesterday that he no longer feels himself to be bound by the moratorium on testing nuclear weapons or long-range ballistic missiles. What has been the U.S. response thus far to that?

KELEMEN: Well, the U.S. envoy is trying to revive diplomacy and keep doors open. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said it would be deeply disappointing if Kim reneges on the commitments that he made to Trump. He says that the U.S. has kept up its end of the bargain by limiting military exercises with South Korea. But the North Koreans want more. They're looking for sanctions relief.

KELLY: One more thing before I let you go, Michelle, which is Ukraine. I mentioned Secretary Pompeo was supposed to be on a plane to Ukraine today. This is to try to help repair the relationship that has, of course, been at the center of the whole impeachment drama. What will canceling this trip, or at least delaying this trip, do to that relationship?

KELEMEN: Well, the State Department says it's a postponement. They say they're working on new dates later this month. So far, Ukraine's foreign minister says he respectfully accepts the decision to postpone, but Ukrainian officials were really hoping a high-level visit would show that relations can weather this impeachment storm. And this is the second time they had been expecting a visit by Pompeo. He - they were expecting him a couple months ago, so this is the second time a cancellation happened.

KELLY: All right. That is NPR's Michele Kelemen tracking all kinds of things there for the State Department. Thanks, Michele.

KELEMEN: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR."," Threaten, not specified below",3
42938,afe5f1fd94fc7815f4a9c9c0494947ab,"Lately, there have been several news items about cultural heritage sites that are either under siege by tourists or the environment. Venice is under water. The Louvre is overrun by visitors seeking a selfie with the Mona Lisa. Pompeii needs saving after its just-completed extensive restoration. Machu Picchu is under threat from a planned international airport in the Sacred Valley.

Preservationists decry the absence of proper management of visitors and the negative impact on local economies for certain heritage sites, and environmentalists point to deteriorating coral reefs and green spaces due to climate change. Activists encourage lower carbon forms of transportation and cleaning up the huge amount of plastic waste in our oceans and waterways. But, people love to travel.

According to The World Bank, international tourist arrivals have increased from 524 million in 1995 to 1.3 billion in 2017, and they are expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030. The tourism industry represents 10 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP) and approximately 11 percent of the world’s employment. Tourism is an important economic activity as well as being a source of education and enjoyment. But, up to 80 percent of tourism dollars can be siphoned away from local economies in some places.

While there are no easy answers to the environmental, economic and social challenges faced by increasing demand for destination-based travel, it’s clear that the future of the world’s most important and cultural sites and tourism destinations should be considered through the lens of sustainable tourism.

But, what exactly is that?

Many writers and activists speak of responsible travel or sustainable travel, but the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) defines sustainable tourism as “tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment and host communities.”



The UNWTO goes on to state that sustainable tourism should:

Make optimal use of environmental resources that constitute a key element in tourism development, maintaining essential ecological processes and helping to conserve natural heritage and biodiversity.

Respect the socio-cultural authenticity of host communities, conserve their built and living cultural heritage and traditional values, and contribute to inter-cultural understanding and tolerance.

Ensure viable, long-term economic operations, providing socio-economic benefits to all stakeholders that are distributed, including stable employment and income-earning opportunities and social services to host communities, and contributing to poverty alleviation.

Maintain a high level of tourist satisfaction and ensure a meaningful experience to the tourists, raising their awareness about sustainability issues and promoting sustainable tourism practices amongst them.



Tourists can help reduce the impact of their travel in several ways:

Informing themselves of the culture, politics and economy of the communities they visit;

Anticipating and respecting local cultures;

Supporting the integrity of local cultures by favoring businesses that conserve cultural heritage and traditional values;

Supporting local economies by purchasing local goods and participating in small, local businesses; and

Conserving resources by seeking out businesses that are environmentally conscious, and by using the least possible amount of non-renewable resources.



Sustainable tourism then is not about discouraging travel and tourism. It’s about refocusing it and helping to ensure a balance between the obvious benefits to visitors and local communities with the inherent liabilities to the environment and the tourist destinations themselves. To the extent that preservationists can embrace the ideals of sustainable tourism so that important and iconic cultural sites can be open and sustainable for future generations, the world’s treasures will more enjoyable and lasting places to experience.

American Express has supported a number of sustainable tourism efforts over the years, including a project to relieve crowding and lessen the impact of tourism at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, the development of a sustainable visitors center on Easter Island, the creation of interactive educational content for visitors to the historic district in Mexico City, and an economic impact study for the numerous museums and cultural sites along Route 66 in the western United States. Stay tuned for an announcement of our new sustainable tourism initiative in the new year.

Both Kumar and Mishra have been sent to judicial custody

Cell phones of the accused are being scanned for any evidence related to the crime

Gurugram: Two men accused of raping a 16-year-old girl were sent to judicial custody by a court in Haryana on Thursday. They have been identified as 34-year-old Shravan Kumar and 30-year-old Nitesh Mishra. Both were arrested on Wednesday from the Aravalli mountain range near Manesar on January 1.

Going by inputs, the minor girl had gone to the mountain range with a friend on New Year's Eve and the two decided to climb a mountain near the Kasan village which is known as a popular 'picnic spot'. They were reportedly taking a selfie when Kumar and Mishra arrived at the spot and started harassing the girl.

When he tried to confront them, the duo overpowered the girl's male friend. Soon after, Mishra dragged the boy away as Kumar threatened and raped the 16-year-old girl. In her complaint, the girl said that Mishra then sexually assaulted her while Kumar held the boy. The couple was rescued by villagers who heard their cries for help and rushed to the spot.

Both Kumar and Mishra were apprehended by villagers and handed over to the police. They were produced in a court and sent to judicial custody. Further investigation into the matter is underway. According to reports, the girl told investigators that the accused had also threatened to upload videos of the crime on social media platforms but no such content was found on their cell phones which have now been sent for forensic testing.

A similar incident has come to light from Duttapukur in the North 24 Parganas district in West Bengal where a 30-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped on New Year's Eve. Another woman approached police, alleging gang-rape in the state's Uttar Dinajpur district on December 31.

The child was covered by bags of fruit and vegetables before he was discovered by police.

He was found at the Beni-Enzar border crossing in the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla on the northwest coast of Africa on 31 December.

It is understood the boy's mother, who was found living at a temporary shelter for migrants, had paid for him to be taken to Europe, but it is not known if he had family waiting for him on the other side.

Morocco has become a major gateway into Europe for migrants.

In January of last year, Spanish border guards discovered two migrants hidden inside mattresses strapped to the roof of a car at a checkpoint on the frontier with Morocco.

Video footage of the incident, reportedly filmed in Melilla, was published on social media by a senator in the Spanish parliament.

More than 6,000 migrants have made it to the city and Spain's nearby Ceuta enclave, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.

In October 2018, one African migrant died and three others were injured when around 300 stormed the border fence separating Melilla from Morocco.

New Zealand's first knight with a disability has grim memories of time spent inside Rangitīkei and Horowhenua hospitals, but they provided him with the impetus to fight for social change.

Martin, who now calls Whanganui home, received his knighthood in the New Year honours for his service towards the disabled community nationally and internationally.

For more than 30 years he's fought against the thought he couldn't succeed or achieve anything in life. He refused to accept that idea and has been encouraging others to refuse it too.

Lake Alice Hospital's swimming pool in 2009. Fire had destroyed most of the roof.

In October he shared his experiences at Lake Alice Hospital, Kimberly Centre and Cameron House in the 1970s, to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in State Care.

""These stories need to be told because a lot of things that happened to disabled people have been left unsaid,"" Martin said.

""I think by giving my evidence ... [it] has opened a door for other disabled people to tell their story.

""Just like other New Zealanders that faced these issues in their lives. Although it was hard on me personally [to tell my story], I think New Zealanders need to hear this stuff as we've often been ignored in the past and we deserve justice, just like everybody else.""

Other survivors of abuse, who were homed at Lake Alice during the same period, received validation from the United Nations in December, when it found the New Zealand Government had breached the Convention against Torture due to police failing to investigate abuse at the Rangitīkei hospital properly.

For Martin, receiving the knighthood was humbling, he said, but it wasn't just for him, it was for everyone who had fought discrimination against disabilities.

""It's also about disabled people and what they can do for their country and how they can have a positive impact on society.

""It's also for the people that are not with us today, who will always be with me no matter where I am or what I am doing. I think it goes to show you that people were wrong in the past, thinking that people with learning disabilities couldn't achieve or do anything.""

The now closed Lake Alice Psychiatric hospital's kitchen in the maximum security prison.

Martin was born in Wellington in 1957. It's thought he developed his learning disabilities due to a traumatic forceps birth where his eye was permanently damaged, his delicate head squashed, bruised and battered.

On a doctor's advice, he was sent away to grow up in some of this country's most notorious institutions. While in care at homes such as Lake Alice, Kimberley Centre, and Cameron House, he was sexually, physically and emotionally abused.

He later settled into a life working with IHC New Zealand. He didn't want anyone else to grow up with the pain he endured in care, so for more than three decades Martin has sought equality for people with learning disabilities nationally and internationally, leading the charge against employers and care facilities.

Katie Scotcher/RNZ Robert Martin is the first person with a learning disability to be elected to a UN Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

As one of the founders of People First NZ in the 1980s, Martin worked for those with disabilities to be seen as people, with feelings and meaningful lives.

""We're not above other people but we're not below them either,"" Martin previously told Stuff. ""We're just different.""

Martin rode his activism to the United Nations, where he was the first person with disabilities to be elected to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2016 and chair a meeting within a UN session in 2018. Although his term as an independent expert ends in 2020 he plans to seek re-election."," Threaten, not specified below",3
43016,f0101fa19f063f6f3c87e2b6f25f51cc,"Top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani was killed on Friday in a US strike on Baghdad's international airport, confirmed Iran and the US, in a dramatic escalation of tensions between the two countries.

The Pentagon said US President Donald Trump ordered Soleimani's ""killing"", after a pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy. Following Soleimani's death, Trump tweeted an image of the US flag without any further explanation.

In the wake of the assassination, the US embassy in Baghdad urged all citizens to depart Iraq immediately.

“Due to heightened tensions in Iraq and the region, the US embassy urges American citizens to heed the January 2020 travel advisory and depart Iraq immediately.""

""US citizens should depart via airline while possible, and failing that, to other countries via land,” it said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to exact “severe revenge” for Soleimani's death.

“Martyrdom was the reward for his ceaseless efforts in all these years,” Khamenei said on his Twitter account in reference to Soleimani, also declaring three days of mourning.

“With him gone, God willing, his work and his path will not be stopped, but severe revenge awaits the criminals who bloodied their foul hands with his blood and other martyrs' in last night's incident,“ he added.

Read more: Qasem Soleimani — the general who became an Iran icon by targeting US

The pre-dawn developments mark the most major escalation yet in a feared proxy war between Iran and the US on Iraqi soil.

Early on Friday, a volley of missiles hit Baghdad's international airport, striking a convoy belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi paramilitary force with close ties to Iran.

Just a few hours later, Iranian state television carried a statement by the Revolutionary Guard Corps saying Soleimani ""was martyred in an attack by America on Baghdad airport this morning"".

The Hashed confirmed that both Soleimani and its deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed in what it said was a ""US strike"". ""The deputy head of the Hashed, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and head of the Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, were killed in a US strike that targeted their car on the Baghdad International Airport road,"" it said.

The Hashed is a network of mostly-Shia armed units, many of whom have close ties to Tehran but which have been officially incorporated into Iraq's state security forces.

The units joined forces to fight the militant Islamic State group in 2014, after many of them built up years of fighting experience during Iraq's war years, including against the US.

According to AP, Iraqi officials said five others were also killed.

Iran minister calls US act 'foolish escalation'

Iran's foreign minister slammed Soleimani's killing as a dangerous escalation and warned the United States would bear responsibility for the consequences.

""The US' act of international terrorism, targeting and assassinating General Soleimani [...] is extremely dangerous and a foolish escalation,"" Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter.

""The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,"" he added.

Iran's top security body called an urgent meeting on Friday over the ""martyrdom"" of Qasem Soleimani by the United States in Baghdad, semi-official news agency ISNA reported.

""In a few hours, an extraordinary meeting of the Supreme National Security Council will be held to review the murderous attack on the vehicle of General Soleimani in Baghdad that lead to his martyrdom,"" ISNA quoted its secretariat spokesman Keyvan Khosravi as saying.

'An enemy of the United States'

US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Soleimani had been killed in a drone strike in Baghdad.

The official said it was aware of the possibility of an Iranian response and US military officials were ready to defend themselves. The official did not rule out additional US troops or military assets going to the region.

Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said while Soleimani was ""an enemy of the United States"", the killing could put more Americans at risk.

""One reason we don't generally (assassinate) foreign political officials is the belief that such action will get more, not less, Americans killed,"" Murphy said on Twitter.

""That should be our real, pressing and grave worry tonight,"" he said.

Former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said that Soleimani's death ""should be applauded by all who seek peace and justice"".

'Major decapitation strike'

Muhandis was the Hashed's deputy chief but widely recognised as the real shot-caller within the group.

Soleimani headed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force and also served as Iran's pointman on Iraq, visiting the country in times of turmoil.

Both were sanctioned by the United States.

The Pentagon said Soleimani had been ""actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region"".

It said it took ""decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani,"" but did not specify how.

Phillip Smyth, a US-based specialist in Shia armed groups, told AFP the strike would have ""bigger"" ramifications than the 2011 US operation that killed Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and the 2019 American raid that killed militant Islamic State group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

""In terms of a decapitation strike, what just happened is the most major decapitation strike that the US has ever pulled off,"" said Smyth.

""There is no comparison,"" he added.

The developments come after an unprecedented attack on the US mission in Baghdad.

A mob of Hashed supporters surrounded the US embassy on Tuesday in outrage over American air strikes that killed 25 fighters from the network's hardline Kataeb Hezbollah faction, which is backed by Iran.

The US had acted in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq. Trump had blamed Iran for a spate of rocket attacks targeting US forces as well as the siege at the embassy, saying: ""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.""

On Thursday, US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper told reporters there could be more attacks from Iran-backed groups but vowed American forces would respond.

""We are prepared to exercise self-defence, and we are prepared to deter further bad behaviour from these groups, all of which are sponsored, directed and resourced by Iran,"" he said.

Oil prices soar

Ties between the US and Iran have deteriorated since Washington pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018.

It then reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran, aiming to choke off its oil exports.

Oil prices soared following Friday's attack, with Brent surging 4.4 per cent to $69.16 and WTI jumping 4.3 per cent to 63.84.

But the attack threatens to destabilise Iraq, which has close political and military ties with both Tehran and Washington.

The United States led the 2003 invasion against then-dictator Saddam Hussein and has worked closely with Iraqi officials since.

But its influence has waned compared with that of Tehran, which has carefully crafted personal ties with Iraqi politicians and armed factions, even during Saddam's reign.

Iraqi officials have warned in recent months that their country could be used as an arena for score-settling between Iran and the US.

A US strike killed Iran Quds Force chief Qassem Soleimani, the Pentagon said on Thursday, adding that Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack Americans in Iraq and the Middle East."," Threaten, not specified below",3

This compared to just one low-temperature record during this decade, with the Beast from the East in 2018 leading to the coldest March day on record with a maximum temperature of -4.7C recorded at Tredegar in South Wales. Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the National Climate Information Centre, said: “It is notable how many of these extreme records have been set in the most recent decade and how many more of them are reflecting high rather than low-temperature extremes: a consequence of our warming climate.” He warned that with the warming trend in the UK expected to continue, this could see more records broken. He added: “We are expecting the warming trend to continue through the 21st century and we would expect these sorts of records subsequently to be broken in the future.” A spokesman for the Government said that climate change was a “national priority” and it is committed to increasing the momentum around environmental action. The Met Office said that 2019 was provisionally the 11th warmest year on record, with a mean average temperature of 9.42C. This puts it just outside the top 10, which have all occurred since 2002, the Met Office said.

Iran's army chief Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi also said yesterday his forces were ready to confront the ""enemy"".

""Our armed forces... monitor all moves, and if anyone makes the slightest mistake, they will decisively react, and if the situation heats up, we will show our abilities to the enemy,"" he said.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had condemned US attacks on Iranian-allied militias in Iraq, blaming the United States for violence in Iran's neighbour.

Iran protested to a Swiss envoy who represents US interests in Tehran, over what it called ""warmongering statements"" by American officials.

Hundreds of supporters of an Iranian-backed militia had chanted ""Death to America"" as they breached part of the outer security layer at the vast compound in Baghdad's protected Green Zone.

Diplomats were barricaded and unharmed inside the $750m embassy, built as a powerful symbol of US permanence after the 2003 invasion of Iraq that Mr Trump has derided as the worst US foreign policy blunder. But the hulking structure may now serve as a symbol of how difficult it can be to disentangle American interests from Iraq and the region despite the president's stated desire to get out of ""endless wars"" and reduce the United States' footprint in the Middle East.

Mr Trump faces a potentially combustible situation where the United States and Iran are elbowing for influence in Iraq as US allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, along with some of Mr Trump's in-house advisers, urge a more forceful confrontation with Tehran over its aggressive tactics across the Middle East.

The president's tweets struck an aggressive tone on Tuesday, but it is unclear what moves he will make next.

""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,"" Mr Trump tweeted from Florida where he is spending the holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

""Happy new year!""

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the president held what he called a good meeting with advisers and approved sending a small contingent of Marines and two Apache helicopters to reinforce security at the embassy while tweeting: ""The US Embassy in Iraq is, & has been for hours, SAFE!""

Defence Secretary Mark Esper also announced yesterday the administration was sending 750 troops to the region as ""an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad"".

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally and foreign policy adviser, had breakfast with the president Tuesday and said in an interview Mr Trump was determined to ""have no Benghazi on his watch,"" a reference to the 2012 attack on US government facilities in Libya that killed the ambassador and three other Americans.

Republicans harshly criticised the Obama administration and then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the response to the Benghazi attacks and Mr Trump's wariness over any comparisons between the two events was publicly on display.

""The Anti-Bengahzi!"" he tweeted about his response to the situation in Baghdad.

Mr Graham said Mr Trump is not looking for a fight and hopes Iran will take steps that allow tensions to be eased soon.

""The goal is to de-escalate, but it takes two to do that,"" he said, adding Mr Trump and his national security team are discussing ""a lot of options"" he would not detail. (© Washington Post)"," Threaten, not specified below",3
43199,e9d721ce5ea6dd107219935638550d6e,"The Pentagon said Thursday that the U.S. military has killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, at the direction of President Donald Trump.

An airstrike killed Soleimani, architect of Iran’s regional security apparatus, at Baghdad’s international airport Friday, Iranian state television and three Iraqi officials said, an attack that’s expected to draw severe Iranian retaliation against Israel and American interests.

The Defense Department said Soleimani “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.” It also accused Soleimani of approving the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.

A statement released late Thursday by the Pentagon said the strike on Soleimani “was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.”

The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, Iraqi officials said. The PMF media arm said the two were killed in an American airstrike that targeted their vehicle on the road to the airport.

Citing a Revolutionary Guard statement, Iranian state television said Soleimani was “martyred” in an attack by U.S. helicopters near the airport, without elaborating.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who was vacationing on his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, but sent out a tweet of an American flag.

Their deaths are a potential turning point in the Middle East and if the U.S. carried them out, it represents a drastic change for American policy toward Iran after months of tensions.

Tehran shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone and seized oil tankers. Meanwhile, the U.S. blames Iran for a series of attacks targeting tankers, as well as a September assault on Saudi Arabia’s oil industry that temporarily halved its production.

The tensions take root in Trump’s decision in May 2018 to withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, struck under his predecessor.

A senior Iraqi politician and a high-level security official confirmed to The Associated Press that Soleimani and al-Muhandis were among those killed in the attack shortly after midnight. Two militia leaders loyal to Iran also confirmed the deaths, including an official with the Kataeb Hezbollah faction, which was involved in the New Year’s Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

The security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis had arrived to the airport in a convoy along with others to receive Soleimani, whose plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria. The airstrike took place near the cargo area after he left the plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and others.

Two officials from the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces said Suleimani’s body was torn to pieces in the attack while they did not find the body of al-Muhandis. Asenior politician said Soleimani’s body was identified by the ring he wore.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject and because they were not authorized to give official statements.

As the head of the Quds, or Jersualem, Force of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Soleimani led all of its expeditionary forces. Quds Force members have deployed into Syria’s long war to support President Bashar Assad, as well as into Iraq in the wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, a longtime foe of Tehran.

Soleimani rose to prominence by advising forces fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq and in Syria on behalf of the embattled Assad.

U.S. officials say the Guard under Soleimani taught Iraqi militants how to manufacture and use especially deadly roadside bombs against U.S. troops after the invasion of Iraq. Iran has denied that. Soleimani himself remains popular among many Iranians, who see him as a selfless hero fighting Iran’s enemies abroad.

Soleimani had been rumored dead several times, including in a 2006 airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and following a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of Assad. Rumors circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria’s Aleppo.

Earlier Friday, an official with the Popular Mobilization Forces said seven people were killed by a missile fired at Baghdad International Airport, blaming the United States.

The official with the group known as the Popular Mobilization Forces said the dead included its airport protocol officer, identifying him as Mohammed Reda.

A security official confirmed that seven people were killed in the attack on the airport, describing it as an airstrike. Earlier, Iraq’s Security Media Cell, which releases information regarding Iraqi security, said Katyusha rockets landed near the airport’s cargo hall, killing several people and setting two cars on fire.

It was not immediately clear who fired the missile or rockets or who was targeted. There was no immediate comment from the U.S.

The attack came amid tensions with the United States after a New Year’s Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The two-day embassy attack which ended Wednesday prompted President Donald Trump to order about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East.

It also prompted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to postpone his trip to Ukraine and four other countries “to continue monitoring the ongoing situation in Iraq and ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Wednesday.

The breach at the embassy followed U.S. airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The U.S. military said the strikes were in retaliation for last week’s killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that the U.S. blamed on the militia.

U.S. officials have suggested they were prepared to engage in further retaliatory attacks in Iraq.

“The game has changed,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday, telling reporters that violent acts by Iran-backed Shiite militias in Iraq — including the rocket attack on Dec. 27 that killed one American — will be met with U.S. military force.

He said the Iraqi government has fallen short of its obligation to defend its American partner in the attack on the U.S. embassy.

The developments also represent a major downturn in Iraq-U.S. relations that could further undermine U.S. influence in the region and American troops in Iraq and weaken Washington’s hand in its pressure campaign against Iran.", Accuse of aggression,3
43205,15ad183d4596581925f0060e08ed4197,"Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Quds Force of Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard, has been killed in a United States’ airstrike at Baghdad airport in Iraq, media has reported.

Iraqi State television said Soleimani was among a number of people killed in a strike near Baghdad's airport, reports BBC.

According to the report, the Popular Mobilisation Forces, an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, told news agency Reuters that Major General Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis had been killed.

The US Department of Defence (DoD) has also confirmed killing of Soleimani in a “decisive defensive action”.

“At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,” the DoD said in a statement.

“General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,” the statement added.

The strike comes days after protesters surrounded the US embassy in Baghdad, clashing with American forces at the scene.

The Russian-born musician, 32, whose family immigrated to Germany in 1995, said he received an email in mid-November threatening an assassination attempt against him at a concert in southern Germany.

His spokeswoman told the German media that Levit informed the police and then played the concert under tight security.

In an essay for the Sunday edition of the Tagesspiegel newspaper, Levit wrote that the threat was “loud and clear.” The email’s author said he would silence this “Jewish pig” in front of his audience.

Levit said he was afraid, but “not for myself.”

“[I’m afraid] for this country. My country. Our country,” he said.

Levit warned that the dangers of racism, antisemitism and right-wing extremist terror are underestimated in Germany, driven largely by social media.

“We are in the middle of a massive shift in norms,” Levit wrote. “Our democracy will no longer be the same if we allow antisemitism, racism and misogyny to gain more and more ground.”

Direct threats are not the only problem, Levit said, noting a recent incident in which a journalist asked him if “Israel is my homeland, because after all I’m a Jew.”

“He probably just wasn’t thinking. But it hit me like a slap,” Levit said. “I flinched because this is how it sounded: ‘You are different. You are not one of us … Somehow you do not really belong here.'”

In May, Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office reported that the number of antisemitic attacks in the country had risen from 1,691 in 2001 to 1,799 in 2018. The office reported 442 offenses, most of them hate speech, between January and June 2019.

Most anti-Semitic acts of violence were motivated by right-wing sentiments,. though a small percentage are ascribed to left-wing extremists and Islamic extremists.

“It’s not about ‘cases,’ or ‘incidents,'” Levit said in his essay. “It’s about victims, time and again. And it is about perpetrators and a pattern! A pattern of antisemitism and racism, right-wing extremism, terror and national-related violence.”

Levit has appeared in major concert halls and music festivals around the world, and has won several international awards.

Meanwhile, on Sunday night two hooded men vandalized a Jewish cemetery in the town of Geilenkirchen in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish airline's passenger plane TK45 en route from Cape Town to Istanbul made an emergency landing on Thursday evening in Johannesburg, South Africa, causing no injuries.

While climbing out of Cape Town's runway, the flight crew failed to retract the plane's landing gear, said the Aviation Herald, an aviation incidents website.

Flightradar24, a tracker app, shows the plane is an Airbus A330-343. Soon after finding something wrong, the plane hovered over Cape Town to burn its fuel for a safe landing. It was then diverted to Johannesburg's Oliver Tambo International Airport for landing and made it safely.

""The plane had problems of its landing gear, but landed at 22:36 p.m. (2030 GMT) at OR Tambo with no injuries and followed by emergency vehicles,"" local aviation expert Stanley Koepka told Xinhua.

The problem of the landing gear is currently under investigation by local engineers."," Physically assault, not specified below",3

AUSTRALIA ordered residents and tourists out of the path of raging bushfires yesterday as the country braced for a weekend heatwave expected to fan the deadly inferno.

Catastrophic blazes ripped through the country’s south-east on New Year’s Eve, killing at least eight people and stranding holidaymakers.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian declared a seven-day state of emergency that allows for forced evacuations beginning today, for the third time in Australia’s most populated region this fire season.

“We don’t take these decisions lightly but we also want to make sure we’re taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday,” she said.

It came as the NSW Rural Fire Service declared two “tourist leave zones” stretching almost 300 kilometers from the town of Nowra along the picturesque coast to neighboring Victoria state, where people are also being urged to flee.

Residents and visitors in two inland areas, which include popular holiday resorts in the Snowy Mountains, were also told to leave, with people given less than 24 hours to evacuate before a heatwave brings gusting winds and temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius. That weather will create conditions that will be as bad as — if not worse than — Tuesday, the deadliest day in a months-long bushfire crisis.

At least 18 people are now known to have died, and there are growing fears the toll could rise dramatically, with officials in Victoria saying 17 people were missing in the state.

Many tourists and residents spent two nights isolated with no electricity or telecommunications, before authorities declared some roads safe to use yesterday. NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance called it the “largest evacuation of people out of the region ever,” with queues of cars reportedly stretching for kilometers along roads toward Sydney and Canberra as thousands fled.

One driver said it had taken her three hours to travel just 50km.

NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said firefighters would be unable to extinguish or even control the raging blazes.

“The message is we’ve got so much fire in that area, we have no capacity to contain these fires,” he told ABC.

“We just need to make sure that people are not in front of them.”

John Steele, 73, who lives outside the south coast town of Merimbula, said some people were “panicking” amid the warnings to evacuate. Steele said he and his wife were staying for now, but added, “We have our bags packed.”

The number of homes confirmed destroyed in recent days has topped 400, with that figure expected to rise as firefighters reach communities still isolated by flames.

Two Navy ships arrived in Mallacoota, where people huddled on the foreshore for hours on New Year’s Eve as a fire bore down on the remote town, to begin evacuating up to 4,000 people in an operation that could take weeks.

Victoria joint bushfire task force commander Doug Laidlaw said the first evacuees would be moved onto the vessels today morning, with children, the sick and elderly taking priority.

“If we need to reset and (return) again, weather permitting, that is exactly what will happen,” he said.

Military aircraft have also been working with emergency crews to drop relief supplies into isolated areas and continue assessing the extensive fire damage.

This season’s blazes have destroyed more than 1,300 homes and scorched over 5.5 million hectares across the country — an area far greater than Denmark or the Netherlands.

Suburbs of cities like Sydney and Melbourne, home to several million people, have also been hit by bushfires. The blazes have shrouded Australia’s capital, Canberra, in acrid smoke haze that has traveled as far as New Zealand, turning the air over glacier peaks brown."," Threaten, not specified below",3

43496,2bf358f2fb1801f0b9944b2824924cbb,"At 5 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 31, Washington’s vehicle emissions check program will end, marking the close of 38 years of emissions testing on cars and trucks in major metropolitan areas.

When state licensing offices reopen Jan. 2, emissions tests will no longer be required in order to renew vehicle registrations. Car owners who are scheduled to have their emissions tested in 2019 still need to get a final test in order to renew their tabs this month, according to a state Department of Ecology news release.

Testing was required in most of Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish and Spokane counties.

“When we began the emission check program back in 1982, air pollution from carbon monoxide and ozone was a serious concern in many of our biggest cities,” said Kathy Taylor, manager of the Air Quality program for the state Department of Ecology, which oversees the emission check program. “Today, new cars are much, much cleaner than in decades past, which means we can continue to improve our state’s air quality without these regular tests.”

Washington’s Legislature set the wheels in motion to end the testing program back in 2005, when it adopted more stringent emissions standards for new cars and trucks. Those standards took effect in 2008, and vehicles 2009 and newer were exempted from the testing requirement. Vehicles older than 25 years are also exempt, which has meant a shrinking pool of cars are still subject to the requirement – total annual tests have declined from a peak of about 1.3 million to roughly 750,000 in 2018.

Even without a testing requirement, it remains illegal in Washington to drive a vehicle with modified emissions controls, and drivers can be ticketed if their vehicle smokes or poses a threat to public health.

The end of the testing program will have little effect on Washington’s efforts to fight climate change. The testing program was always aimed at toxic forms of air pollution like carbon monoxide, rather than the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are the primary drivers of climate change.

Closing the program will affect about 180 people statewide that work for Applus, a contractor that operates the testing stations for the state, and a dozen employees at Ecology, plus several independent testing stations and certified repair facilities. Applus and Ecology have been working with their staff members to help them prepare for the shutdown, and find other positions when possible.

“We want to thank our staff and our partners for their efforts,” Taylor said, “but most of all, we want to thank Washington drivers for doing their part to maintain their cars and protect the air we all breathe.”"," Threaten, not specified below",3

The display on your phone reads 120 degrees. The sign at the bank you just passed says it’s 121.

Yet you hear the “official” temperature for Phoenix at Sky Harbor Airport was only 119.

What gives?

Why do these readings differ? Isn’t the temperature the same all over town? Why is the official thermometer at the airport when no one lives there?

Aren’t there standards for this kind of thing?

Turns out there are standards for the placement of thermometers, rain gauges and other official weather-observation instruments. But there are many sources for temperature information and the quality of those sources can vary.

Why the airport?

CLOSE Did you ever wonder why there are weather gauges at Sky Harbor Airport? Weldon B. Johnson/azcentral.com

The reason is both simple and practical, said Ken Waters, Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix.

“The reason for that is, most importantly, to get a really accurate observation for the airplanes coming in and taking off,” Waters said. “Their measurements have to be pretty accurate when you’re talking about things like visibility and cloud height. Airports have various restrictions where (planes) can’t take off if visibility or the base of clouds are below a certain level.”

The instrument array at major airports such as Sky Harbor provides critical information such as air pressure, wind speed and direction, wind shear and lightning detection.

Some of these instruments help detect potentially dangerous weather phenomena such as microbursts (a column of sinking air within a thunderstorm). Microbursts can be deadly if they catch pilots landing an airplane by surprise.

So, you want those instruments as close to the runways as possible.

“If you have a sensor you’re using for planes to land and it’s a few miles away from the airport, that can be problematic,” Waters said.

Temperature isn’t usually the most critical factor for flight safety, but there are operating limits for aircraft. For example, last month’s extreme high temperatures caused the cancellation of dozens of flights at Sky Harbor. Air becomes less dense as it heats up, which makes it harder for planes to produce enough thrust to reach takeoff speeds. Pilots and airlines need to know when temperatures approach those safe operating limits.

A little history

The official thermometer for the city hasn’t always been at the airport.

Starting in 1895 when records were first kept, the official temperature was recorded in the city’s downtown. In 1954 meteorologists began making the observations at the airport.

The instruments have been moved a couple of times as the airport expanded. They have been in their current location near the southern edge of the airport since 2000, Waters said.

“I think it’s been in a couple of different locations at the airport,” he said. “We try not to move it too much. We want to maintain a pure period of record where it’s not moving around and potentially including any effects because of a different location.”

There are standards

The Weather Service strives for consistency not only at a particular location but within its network of stations throughout the country. As a result, there are standards for positioning instruments such as thermometers and rain gauges.

The official rain gauge at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. (Photo: KTVK 3TV photo)

Official thermometers are placed at a height of 5 feet (give or take a foot) over unimproved ground.

The height standard is an attempt to measure air temperature at a level close to where people normally breathe. In locations where grass is common, thermometers are placed over grass. In Phoenix, the instruments are positioned over sandy, rocky soil.

Temperature sensors are placed in shade or, most often, in an enclosed structure that blocks sunlight but allows air to circulate. Placing the thermometer in direct sunlight could affect measurements. The enclosure also protects the thermometer from rain or snow.

The instruments are automated, transmitting data to their corresponding NWS office. (The Phoenix office is actually in Tempe, not at the airport.) Considering their importance to aviation, there are backup instruments at another location on the airport grounds.

Not the only game in town

Metro Phoenix covers a vast area and variations in terrain and other conditions cause different temperatures from city to city. In some cases, there are variations within a city.

While the Weather Service’s official observation site for Phoenix is at the airport, it’s not the only one. That’s why you can sometimes find significant variations in temperatures relatively close to one another.

For example, if you look at the current observations page on the National Weather Service’s Phoenix website, you can find significant differences within the city, not to mention the surrounding area. A station near the former Phoenix Greyhound Park consistently reports 10-15 degrees higher than Sky Harbor Airport. The station at South Mountain Park is usually cooler than the one at the airport.

Some services, such as cellphone apps, use weather networks other than the National Weather Service. Those commercial services may use different reporting stations for their information.

Some thermometers, such as the signs reporting temperatures at banks, other businesses or even in cars, report temperatures from on-site thermometers. Those thermometers can be warmer or cooler than the official site, depending on their surroundings.

“That's one reason why, whenever you’re comparing one observation to another, you have to look at the siting,” Waters said. “The thermometer could be in direct sun or on top of an asphalt roof. That’s why we sometimes see some wacky observations.”

43535,0166adfcb5d029e7fa8267e02c80336c,"Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum said Thursday that caravan migrants arriving by the hundreds and already numbering in the thousands are no longer welcome. His sentiment is expressed by more and more residents of the Mexican border city.

The mayor called the caravaners a “horde” infiltrated by criminals who now threaten the community. He called them violent, aggressive, and rude people. He might refuse to continue taking them.

“…they are all migrants…some are lazy, smoking marijuana, and they are attacking families in Playas de Tijuana, what is that?” he said. There are “bad people” among the hordes.

Comments on the article at Milenio range from calling the mayor a showboater and xenophobe to people pleading for deportation of those without papers, “especially the ones walking around with their faces covered”.

In an interview with Milenio Television.“Tijuana is a city of immigrants, but we don’t want them in this way,” the mayor said. “It was different with the Haitians, they carried papers, they were in order. It wasn’t a horde, pardon the expression.”

Gastelum wants the Mexican government to demands to deport the caravan migrants as soon as possible.

“You’re going to tell me we have to respect human rights,” he said. “But human rights are for law-abiding humans.”

He is expressing the anger of many Tijuana residents as the mobs of aggressive invaders storm in, at least 3,000 by Thursday.

VIOLENCE IS ERUPTING

Hundreds of Tijuana residents protested outside a park where the migrants have set up camp. Some of the protesters shouted anti-immigrant slogans and tossed rocks at the migrants, even as police looked on.

As we learned yesterday, the Mayor expects these hordes to continue coming for at least six months, perhaps much longer.

There is a long wait list for the processing of people at ports of entry and Tijuana doesn’t want to be stuck with these people.

“We’re talking about a minimum of six months, and there’s no upper limit,” Gastelum said.

President Donald Trump told the reporters these people will not be released into the United States as he was heading for his helicopter Saturday on his way to California to meet with Governor Jerry Brown and incoming Governor Gavin Newsom. He noted the migrants are not refugees when they come in waving their countries’ flags.

43566,f59d4c21a9608a3575e18ce7508f38cd,"Jermarico Carter has confessed to stabbing a man to death back in 2010, according to Houston Police.

ATLANTA — A wanted murderer hid in Atlanta for several years while an innocent man sat behind bars in Texas.

""I knew that this day was going to come. I just didn't know when,"" said Lydell Grant, who was just released from prison.

In 2010, 28-year-old Aaron Scheerhoorn was stabbed to death outside a bar near Houston. Several eyewitnesses testified against Grant, who was convicted in 2012. He maintained his innocence all along.

Years later, District Attorney Kim Ogg charged 41-year-old Jermarico Carter with Scheerhoorn's murder. Jail records show Carter has had lived in Fulton, Dekalb and Newton counties since at least 2013. He's been arrested several times in metro Atlanta, though, mostly for minor charges.

Carter was arrested again in December at a pawn shop for an outstanding warrant for probation violation out of Statesboro. He's still in the Bulloch County jail, but he's expected to be transferred to Texas soon.

Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said Carter confessed to killing Scheerhoorn shortly after his arrest Thursday.

""I sat in jail for what you did,"" said Grant after he was asked what he would say to Carter today. ""But I'm not mad at him. I'm not mad at him at all. I forgive him.""

Scheerhoorn, 28, was killed outside Club Blur in Montrose on Dec. 10, 2010. KHOU in Houston reports that authorities said Scheerhoorn ran to a bouncer outside the club after he was attacked and pleaded to get inside.

The bouncer, however, refused and Scheerhoorn ran to an adjacent parking lot where he was stabbed multiple times. He later died at Ben Taub General Hospital. Witnesses outside the club said the killer coldly stared them down.

Grant was arrested five days later during a traffic stop for driving on a suspended license. Police said he matched the description of the killer offered by a Crime Stoppers tip. Six eyewitnesses later pointed Grant out in a photo lineup. During the trial, prosecutors pointed to a ski mask, Halloween mask and a wig found in the trunk of his car.

TEHRAN: Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed “severe revenge” after the United States killed the commander of the Islamic republic’s Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani, in Baghdad on Friday.

“Martyrdom was the reward for his ceaseless efforts in all these years,” Khamenei said on his Farsi-language Twitter account in reference to Soleimani, also declaring three days of mourning.

“With him gone, God willing, his work and his path will not be stopped, but severe revenge awaits the criminals who bloodied their foul hands with his blood and other martyrs’ in last night’s incident.”

US says it kills top Iranian commander Soleimani in air strike

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif took to social media to label the assassination of General Soleimani “extremely dangerous and a foolish escalation”.

He also said that the United States bears the responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.

The United States killed Iran’s top general and the architect of Tehran’s proxy wars in the Middle East in an airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport on Friday, an attack that threatens to dramatically increase tensions in the region.

The targeted killing of General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, could draw forceful Iranian retaliation against American interests in the region and spiral into a far larger conflict between the US and Iran, endangering US troops in Iraq, Syria and beyond.

The US Defence Department said it killed Soleimani because he “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region”. It also accused Soleimani of approving the attacks on the US Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.

An adviser to Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani quickly warned US President Donald Trump of retaliation from Tehran.

“Trump through his gamble has dragged the US into the most dangerous situation in the region,” Hessameddin Ashena wrote on the social media app Telegram. “Whoever put his foot beyond the red line should be ready to face its consequences.”

The airport strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces, and five others including the PMF’s airport protocol officer, Mohammed Reda, Iraqi officials said.

Mr Trump was holidaying on his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, but sent out a tweet of an American flag.

The dramatic attack comes at the start of a year in which Mr Trump faces both a Senate trial following his impeachment by the US House of Representatives, and a re-election campaign. It marks a potential turning point in the Middle East and represents a drastic change for American policy toward Iran after months of tensions.

Tehran shot down a US military surveillance drone and seized oil tankers. The US also blames Iran for a series of attacks targeting tankers, as well as a September assault on Saudi Arabia’s oil industry that temporarily halved its production.

The tensions take root in Mr Trump’s decision in May 2018 to withdraw the US from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, struck under his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Soleimani was the target of Friday’s US attack, which was conducted by an armed American drone, according to a US official. His vehicle was struck on an access road near the Baghdad airport.

A senior Iraqi security official said the airstrike took place near the cargo area after Soleimani left his plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and others. The official said the plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria.

Two officials from the PMF, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Suleimani’s body was torn to pieces in the attack, while they did not find the body of al-Muhandis. A senior politician said Soleimani’s body was identified by the ring he wore.

It’s unclear what legal authority the US relied on to carry out the attack. American presidents claim broad authority to act without congressional approval when US personnel or interests are facing an imminent threat. The Pentagon did not provide evidence to back up its assertion that Soleimani was planning new attacks against Americans.

Democratic Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Mr Trump owed a full explanation to Congress and the American people.

“The present authorisations for use of military force in no way cover starting a possible new war. This step could bring the most consequential military confrontation in decades,” Blumenthal said.

But Trump allies were quick to praise the action.

“To the Iranian government: if you want more, you will get more,” tweeted South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham.

For Iran, the killing represents more than just the loss of a battlefield commander, but a cultural icon who represented national pride and resilience while facing US sanctions.

While careful to avoid involving himself in politics, Soleimani’s profile rose sharply as US and Israeli officials blamed him for Iranian proxy attacks abroad.

While Iran’s conventional military has suffered under 40 years of American sanctions, the Guard has built up a ballistic missile program. It also can strike asymmetrically in the region through forces like Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The US has long blamed Iran for car bombings and kidnappings it never claimed.

As the head of the Quds, or Jersualem Force of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Soleimani led all of its expeditionary forces and frequently shuttled between Iraq, Lebanon and Syria.

US officials say the Guard under Soleimani taught Iraqi militants how to manufacture and use especially deadly roadside bombs against US troops after the invasion of Iraq. Iran has denied that. Soleimani himself remained popular among many Iranians, who saw him as a selfless hero fighting Iran’s enemies abroad.

The pre-dawn developments mark the most major escalation yet in a feared proxy war between Iran and the US on Iraqi soil.

According to AP, Iraqi officials said five others were also killed.

Iran minister calls US act 'foolish escalation'

Iran's foreign minister slammed Soleimani's killing as a dangerous escalation and warned the United States would bear responsibility for the consequences.

""The US' act of international terrorism, targeting and assassinating General Soleimani [...] is extremely dangerous and a foolish escalation,"" Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter.

""The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,"" he added.

Iran's top security body called an urgent meeting on Friday over the ""martyrdom"" of Qasem Soleimani by the United States in Baghdad, semi-official news agency ISNA reported.

""In a few hours, an extraordinary meeting of the Supreme National Security Council will be held to review the murderous attack on the vehicle of General Soleimani in Baghdad that lead to his martyrdom,"" ISNA quoted its secretariat spokesman Keyvan Khosravi as saying.

'An enemy of the United States'

US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Soleimani had been killed in a drone strike in Baghdad.

The official said it was aware of the possibility of an Iranian response and US military officials were ready to defend themselves. The official did not rule out additional US troops or military assets going to the region.

Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said while Soleimani was ""an enemy of the United States"", the killing could put more Americans at risk.

""One reason we don't generally (assassinate) foreign political officials is the belief that such action will get more, not less, Americans killed,"" Murphy said on Twitter.

WASHINGTON, DC – Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Thursday that President Donald Trump has “tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox"" with the targeted killing of Iran's top general in an airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport.

The former vice president joined other Democratic White House hopefuls in criticizing Trump's order, saying it could leave the U.S. “on the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East.""

The Pentagon said the U.S. military killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in Baghdad Friday at the direction of Trump. The attack is expected to draw severe Iranian retaliation against Israel and American interests. The Defense Department said Soleimani “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.""

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a statement saying, “Trump's dangerous escalation brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars.""

Democrats acknowledged the threat posed by Soleimani, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling him “a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans.""

However, she added, Trump's “reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict.""

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted: “War with Iran is the last thing we need and is not the will of the American people. We should be acting to deescalate tensions and protect our people in the region.""

The attack also drew criticism from Democrats who aren't running for president. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration conducted the airstrike without consultation of Congress or an authorization for use of military force against Iran. She said it “risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence.""

But Republicans on Capitol Hill stood behind Trump. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said: “I appreciate President Trump’s bold action against Iranian aggression. To the Iranian government: if you want more, you will get more.”

And Sen. James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: “America does not and should not seek war, but it will respond in kind to those who threaten our citizens, soldiers and friends — as the President has long promised.

A mum-of-three called police to an incident at her home days before she and her partner were knifed to death there.

Rhys Hancock, 39, was yesterday charged with the murders of his estranged wife Helen, also 39, and marketing firm boss Martin Griffiths, 48.

Derbyshire Police referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Con­­­duct over the earlier call out.

Officers arrested Hancock, a former headteacher, on New Year’s Day after again being called to the £400,000 home he once shared with PE teacher Helen in Duffield, at 4am.

They found Helen and Martin dead from stab wounds.

The couple had dated for six months.

Helen’s family said they were “devastated” and called her “a lovely, beautiful, friendly, bubbly and social person”.

Dad-of-two Martin separated from wife Claire last year.

He met Helen, who split from Hancock in 2018 and was using her maiden name Almey, at a running club.

University of Wollongong (UOW) Vice-Chancellor, Professor Paul Wellings CBE, has reaffirmed the University’s support for local communities affected by the 2019-2020 summer bushfires and announced arrangements for campuses, students and staff affected by the crisis.

“Being a multi-campus institution operating in regions of NSW that have been devastated by bushfires, and as many of our students come from areas affected or under threat, the University of Wollongong stands with the community as we confront this unprecedented emergency,” Professor Wellings said.

Over the Christmas/New Year period, as fires ravaged NSW South Coast towns and villages, UOW’s Batemans Bay and Bega campuses have become additional places of refuge for displaced residents, students and holidaymakers alongside the main community evacuation centres.

Some staff at these campuses have worked tirelessly to serve their communities despite their own homes being under threat or lost in the blazes.

In Nowra, the University’s Shoalhaven Campus remains among the many homes, businesses, community facilities and infrastructure under threat from approaching fires.

UOW is proud of staff members who are serving their community as NSW Rural Fire Service or NSW State Emergency Services volunteers, or in any other volunteer capacity. Our bushfire experts continue to offer their expertise to assist the NSW Government and the broader community.

“On behalf of everyone at the University of Wollongong, I offer condolences and sincere sympathy to the students, staff, residents and visitors who have lost loved ones, homes, businesses or property during these devastating fires.

“I also thank all those serving with the NSW Rural Fire Service and other emergency services and supporting organisations for your courage and selfless dedication during this time. Your commitment to community in the face of such a prolonged and large-scale crisis is inspiring and much appreciated.

“Thank you also to the more than 100 UOW staff who have already committed to support the University’s Bushfire Appeal through our UOW Cares Workplace Giving Program.

“All donations made by staff via payroll deduction to the NSW Rural Fire Service will be matched dollar-for-dollar by the University.

“I encourage all staff who have not already done so to consider supporting our community in this way.”

Campus closures

With a renewed state of emergency declared for seven days from Friday 3 January, the bushfires will continue to impact on operations at some UOW campuses.

Normal operations at the Bega, Batemans Bay and Shoalhaven Campuses will be suspended until at least Monday 13 January, 2020.

“As some staff and students have endured losses and cannot safely reach their campus, this temporary suspension of operations will allow for the immediate danger to pass and time for the community to adjust.

“A re-assessment of the bushfire threat will be made throughout next week to determine if any further postponement of normal operations is required.”

The Batemans Bay and Bega campuses will continue to provide additional places of refuge alongside the main community evacuation centres.

The Shoalhaven Campus will remain closed due to the threat of fires in the West Nowra area.

At this stage, the Wollongong, Innovation, Southern Highlands, Southern Sydney (Loftus), South West Sydney (Liverpool) and Sydney CBD campuses are currently unaffected. At these locations, classes, research, school holiday activities and other campus operations will continue as scheduled.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Friday that ""harsh retaliation is waiting"" for the US after an American airstrike killed Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian general and the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force, in Iraq.

In the statement, which was carried by state television and posted online, Khamenei also declared a three-day mourning period for the commander, the Associated Press reported.

His warnings followed several earlier Iranian reactions.

One of the first reactions came from senior IRGC official and Iranian politician Mohsen Rezaee, who wrote: ""We will take vigorous revenge on America.""

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif then sharply criticized the US strike on Soleimani, calling the move ""extremely dangerous"" and a ""foolish escalation.""

""The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,"" the minister said on Twitter as Iranians awoke to the news that the notorious commander of the infamous Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force is dead. Soleimani was a respected figure in Iran who led the elite Quds Force for over two decades and reported only to Iran's supreme leader.

Hours after the death of Soleimani, a senior adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani issued a warning on Telegram, according to the Associated Press. ""Trump through his gamble has dragged the US into the most dangerous situation in the region. Whoever put his foot beyond the red line should be ready to face its consequences.""

State television, which had canceled broadcasts to focus on the death of the Iranian general, called the US move a major miscalculation, stating that ""the people of the region will no longer allow Americans to stay.""

Following Khamenei's statement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that ""the great nation of Iran will take revenge for this heinous crime.""

The Iranian reactions followed an announcement from the Department of Defense that the US military, acting on the orders of President Donald Trump, ""has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qassem Soleimani.""

The US said that Soleimani is directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US service members over the years, as well as more recent attacks on US personnel. The Pentagon said that the general was planning additional attacks that threatened US personnel and interests in the region.

43773,877a92a316cd2db90ede9e2f5b18b065,"'Violent crimes are common': Israel issues travel warning for SA

Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Share

Durban - South Africa’s “high levels of crime” have prompted Israel to join the US and several EU countries in issuing travel warnings for its citizens intending to visit the country. In a travel warning issued on New Year’s Day, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “In South Africa, there is a high level of crime.” Adding details for its citizens, the ministry described South Africa as a country battling violent crime, saying that women were at particular risk. It appears the security concerns were heightened when an Israeli woman was gang-raped and robbed while on holiday in Mpumalanga province in September last year. “Violent crimes are also common, and target tourists. The majority of criminal episodes are concentrated in townships and homeless areas, including commercial areas, especially in the evenings and after dark,” the ministry warned.

According to Israel’s leading publication, The Jerusalem Post, which got the full advisory warning and ran it as one of their major news items, the ministry presented several recommendations for Israeli visitors.

These included not using public transport and carrying a lot of money or valuables, leaving natural reserves and other tourist areas before dark as well as hiding valuables under the seats when driving.

Moreover, it advised women not to walk alone as they were easy targets.

The online article by the publication drew comments from people who seemed to have knowledge of South Africa’s crime situation.

One user commented: “South Africa is a cesspool of rape, crime and hatred. My daughter has to move apartments and I told the new landlords only on condition of installing security gates on all opening doors. This place is a haven for criminals and rapists.”

The country’s high crime rate has been in the global spotlight for years, with some international organisations saying its murder rate is on par with countries at war.

On December 23, the US revised its travel warning for its citizens and changed it from Level 1 (normal) to level 2 (increased caution).

It told its citizens to exercise increased caution when in South Africa due to crime, civil unrest, and drought.

The warning said South Africa was prone to violent crime such as armed robbery, rape, car-jacking, mugging, and “smash-and-grab” attacks on vehicles.

“There is a higher risk of violent crime in townships and the central business districts of major cities after dark. Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. Such events have the potential to turn violent.

“These can develop quickly without prior notification, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services. Parts of South Africa are experiencing severe weather conditions, including drought and/or flooding. Water supplies in some areas may be affected,” it said. The spokesperson of the Department of International Relations and Co-operation (Dirco), Clayson Monyela, said the ministry would not comment on the issue.

While Dirco hardly comments on advisories about the country, in 2017, the ANC took offence when Australian MP Matthew Guy - while commenting on prisoners who had escaped from one of their correctional facilities - called for the sacking of a provincial premier saying the current government was “standing by and allowing Melbourne to become the Johannesburg of the South Pacific”.

The ruling party said the comments were derogatory and sought to portray South Africa in a negative manner, “more specifically the city of Joburg as crime-infested”.

At least four people died in violent anti-CAA protests in Assam in December

Guwahati: Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal reiterated that he won’t allow “foreigners"" to settle in his state just a day after he was shown black flags in Barpeta after making the claim.

“No foreigner can come to Assam as a result of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), nor shall we let them come in. By no means, the Act affects the demography of Assam,” he said.

Assam saw one of the most violent anti-CAA as the people feared that the newly-amended law will allow Bangladeshis to become Assamese citizens.

""The government has given suggestion to the Central government, which is in a process to frame the rules for the Citizenship Amendment Act to incorporate state government's view so that interest of indigenous people remains protected,"" Sonowal told media persons.

Asserting that he is also the ""son of this soil and will not compromise with the interest of indigenous people"" at any cost, Sonowal said, ""I would like to make an appeal to the people of my state to have trust in me. I am your son and we are in power due to your blessings. We, son of the soil, are running this government since 2016 but never compromise with the interest of people. Please do not isolate me from you...where will I go if you do so....just wait and watch for some time, all false campaign will fall flat.""

As a son of Assam, I will never settle foreigners in my state. This Sarbananda Sonowal will never allow this...

Sonowal’s statement comes a day after he was shown black flags by people protesting CAA in Sarthebari area of Barpeta district. Protests erupted shortly after the Assam chief minister asserted that the citizenship law will not affect the indigenous population as rules have been formed to protect their interests.

""People should have no doubt or confusion in their mind regarding this law. We have many plans regarding the protection of their interests and on this first day of the New Year, I want to assure all '(sons of the soil) that they are completely secure and there is no power that can endanger their existence?"", Sonowal said during a media interaction on the occasion of the New Year.

43896,42faa2b50b581d162c65d9d16ac4b750,"PENAMPANG: Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) will not field a candidate in the upcoming Kimanis by-election, in a decision which could likely pave the way for a straight fight between Warisan and Sabah Umno.

PBS president Maximus Ongkili said the decision was reached after studying voter sentiments in the federal constituency.

But Maximus said the party would only support the opposition if it has a commitment to fight for Sabah’s rights.

“The candidate must oppose policies and programmes that compromise the security of Sabah and threaten the citizenship rights of native Sabahans,” he said after chairing a PBS supreme council meeting today.

PBS has over 3,000 members spread across 60 branches in Bongawan and Membakut within Kimanis.

There are 29,644 voters in Kimanis, comprising 42% Muslim Bumiputeras, 41% non-Muslim Bumiputeras and 6% Chinese.

PBS and Sabah Umno had been in discussions about the possibility of fielding a single candidate.

In announcing former Bongawan rep Mohd Alamin as Sabah Umno’s candidate in the by-election, its president Bung Mokthar Radin had noted that PBS would stay out of the race.

Nomination day for the Kimanis by-election is on Jan 4 and polling day is on Jan 18.

On Dec 25, Ongkili said PBS was considering fielding a candidate in Kimanis as it had ground support and that they were assessing the situation.

The Kota Marudu MP said there were about 6,000 to 8,000 people in Kimanis who were not committed to Umno or Warisan-Pakatan Harapan.

Ongkili said PBS would also support the candidate who was against the federal government’s implementation of the Temporary Sabah Pass (PSS).

“To us in PBS, the PSS is an ultimate threat to our citizenship rights and a form of formalising the illegal immigrants to live permanently in Sabah, and subsequently granting them citizenship which would be detrimental to Sabahans’ livelihood,” he said.

Ongkili said PBS would publicly express its political support to the right candidate after the nomination day.

He said PBS would begin mobilising its election machinery on Monday, adding that the party would be the kingmaker as it had over 3,000 active members in Kimanis.

When asked if Alamin met the party’s criteria, Ongkili said the Sabah Umno candidate’s views on illegal immigrants and state rights when he was the Bongawan rep were not in line with the PBS’ criteria.

“But clearly we will supoort any party or individual who opposed the present Warisan-led state government,” he said.

When asked about Sabah-Umno’s cooperation with PAS under the Muafakat Nasional, Ongkili said it was too early to be part of the partnership.

“A lot of policies need improvement, but the idea of Muafakat Nasional, we will take our time to decide on this,” he said.

A partial transcript is as follows:

NICOLLE WALLACE: I want to stay with Iraq, Ben. And, it’s my observation that [President Trump’s] policy toward Iran is the most schizophrenic of all of Trump’s ill-thought-out, at least in the case of Russia, they are all consistently pro-Putin. In the case of North Korea, he has a delusion that they are beloved pen pals and there’s a peace deal, when there isn’t. In Iran, he seems truly schizophrenic. There are enough people around him, including his son-in-law, who are arguing for a more confrontation approach. But on New Year’s Eve, standing next to Melania, he called for peace with Iran. How does that land in the region?

BEN RHODES: You’re exactly right, Nicolle. Because, basically, the logic of what Trump has actually done is confrontation with Iran. He’s imposed these new santions, he pulled out of the nuclear deal… And schizophrenic is the right description of the policy, Nicolle, because Donald Trump likes to stand up and say that he’s getting us out of these places, that he’s pulling the troops out, that he’s winding down these wars. But the reality is there’s thousands more U.S. troops in the Middle East because Donald Trump has deployed them to Saudi Arabia to provide, essentially, security for his partner there, Mohammad bin Salman. Now additional troops necessary to secure our embassy in Iraq. So we’ve seen him do things like pull back. A few hundred U.S. troops are having an enormous impact in Syria in ways that allowed for ISIS fighters to escape and potentially to regenerate, that has certainly led to the killing of some of our Kurdish allies who fought with us."," Threaten, not specified below",3

44164,b8212d028c3551cb23c9f071f38b9d93,"Washington: US President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Iran Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani, who died in Baghdad ‘in a decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad’, the Pentagon said in a release.

“General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,” the Department of Defence said.

Following Soleimani’s death, Trump tweeted an image of the US flag without any further explanation.

The strike, which occurred at Baghdad’s international airport Friday in Iraq, also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

A pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy following deadly American air strikes on a hardline Hashed faction.

The US had called the strikes in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

The Baghdad airport was hit in a volley of missiles just after midnight Friday, Iraq’s military had announced. Security sources told this agency the bombardment hit a Hashed convoy and killed eight people, including ‘important figures’.

Soleimani headed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force and also served as Iran’s pointman on Iraq, visiting the country in times of turmoil.

“At the direction of the President, the US military has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” the Pentagon said. “This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” it added.

The Pentagon said that Soleimani had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the past months, including the one December 27, the day the US contractor was killed.

“General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the US Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week,” the Pentagon informed.

(CNSNews.com) – Democrats including 2020 presidential candidates weighing in on the killing of IRGC Qods Force commander Major-General Qassem Soleimani accused President Trump of “dangerous escalation.” Republicans welcomed the end of a man blamed for the deaths of hundreds of American troops.

“Trump’s dangerous escalation brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “Trump promised to end endless wars, but this action puts us on the path to another one.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden called the airstrike that killed Soleimani in Baghdad “a hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region” and disputed the Pentagon’s assertion that the goal was to deter future Iranian attacks.

‘[T]his action almost certainly will have the opposite effect,” he said in a statement.

Biden also said no American would mourn Soleimani’s death. “He deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops and thousands of innocents throughout the region.”

But he accused Trump of having “tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox,” adding that “he owes the American people an explanation of the strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel, our people and our interests, both here at home and abroad, and our partners throughout the region and beyond.”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asked, “did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?”

That brought a strong pushback from Republicans.

“This tweet is simply drunk partisanship,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse in response to Murphy’s remark. “Gen. Soleimani has killed hundreds and hundreds of Americans, and was actively plotting more. This commander-in-chief – any C-in-C. – has an obligation to defend America by killing this bastard.”

Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), a former U.S. Navy SEAL, also hit back at Murphy: “Someone let the Senator know that these men just got done directing attacks against our embassy & K1 facility.”

“This was clearly a response to aggression & a deterrent to future attacks, well within current authorization. It’s a great day for the fight against evil in this world.”

(K1 is the base near Kirkuk which Qods Force-backed Iraqi militias attacked with rockets on December 27, killing an American civilian contractor. The Pentagon said overnight that Soleimani had orchestrated that attack, among others targeting coalition forces in Iraq.)

“Qassem Soleimani masterminded Iran’s reign of terror for decades, including the deaths of hundreds of Americans,” said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). “Tonight, he got what he richly deserved, and all those American soldiers who died by his hand also got what they deserved: justice. America is safer now after Soleimani’s demise.”

Cotton is a U.S. Army veteran with combat service in Iraq. U.S. commanders hold Soleimani and Qods Force responsible for the deaths of at least 500 U.S. troops in Iraq.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted: “FICTION: Trump ordered the assassination of a foreign “General” and as a result has placed us on the brink of war. FACT: Soleimani was an active enemy combatant, more dangerous than evil men such as Bin Laden & Baghdadi & who operated without regard for the law of war.”

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called Soleimani’s death “welcome and long-overdue justice for the thousands of Americans killed or wounded by his Iranian-controlled forces across the Middle East, and for the hundreds of thousands of Syrians and Iraqi Sunnis ethnically cleansed by his militias. It is also long-overdue justice for our Israeli allies who have suffered decades of terrorism at the hands of Hezbollah terrorists commanded by his IRGC Quds Force. The message to all those who mean harm to America is loud and clear.”

Independent Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.), a former Republican, was among those concerned about the constitutional authorization issue.

“There’s a reason our Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war: Every American may be intimately affected by a violent conflict,” he tweeted. “Soleimani was evil. But our system demands consent for war from the people, acting through their representatives and senators in Congress.”

And Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) offered this take on the night’s dramatic developments:

“So what if Trump wants war, knows this leads to war and needs the distraction? Real question is, will those with congressional authority step in and stop him? I know I will.”

A security source and lawmaker anonymously told Xinhua that ""eight people, including Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, were killed in the attack on a military base near Baghdad International Airport.""

Previous reports said three rockets targeting the airport struck two vehicles nearby, killing at least seven people, including five Iraqi militia members and ""two guests"" in the cars.

Two of the deaths were Iranian nationals, the source confirmed with Xinhua.

The Iraqi state TV additionally reported that Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, was among the killed.

Meanwhile, U.S. media citing a Pentagon source reported that al-Muhandis and Soleimani were killed in the strike, and DNA results are pending.

After the attack, parliament lawmaker Mish'aan al-Jubouri, who has a close relationship with al-Muhamdis, said in a tweet that ""I mourn the brother, the rebellious, the dear and loyal friend who I have always watched him defying the death.""

The attack came after supporters of the Hashd Shaabi militias stormed on Tuesday the perimeter of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.

The airstrike, which took place at Baghdad International Airport in Iraq on Friday, also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy of the Popular Mobilization Units, according to NBC News. The Defense Department claimed that the airstrike was a response to intelligence pointing to planned attacks on Americans by Soleimani.

""General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,"" the Pentagon said. ""General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.""

The killing of the commander, who politicians across the political aisle acknowledged was responsible for the lives of many Americans, marked a sharp escalation after thousands of protesters stormed into the heavily-guarded compound of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday in response to American airstrikes, which killed 24 members of an Iranian-backed militia over the weekend. A majority of those involved were affiliated with Kataeb Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite militia group, according to NBC News.

The targeted killing could come to pass as a defining foreign policy decision of Trump's presidency.

The Pentagon's statement directly blamed Soleimani for the attack on the embassy, in which protesters made it to the reception area of the compound, according to NBC News. In response, the president had already ordered the deployment 650 soldiers to the Middle East.

""[Soleimani] had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months, including the attack on Dec. 27, culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel,"" the department said. ""General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week.""

The president did not publicly address the airstrike Thursday, though he did tweet the image of the American flag, leading many to speculate it was an acknowledgment of his show of military force. The kill order stood in sharp contrast to the president's invocation of the word ""peace"" more than once when asked about a potential war with Iran on New Year's Eve.

""I want to have peace. I like peace,"" the president said, according to an official White House transcript. ""And Iran should want peace more than anybody.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden, currently one of the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination to take on Trump in 2020, issued a stark warning about the potential consequence of Trump's actions: ""We could be on the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East.""

Dr Maszlee Malik (pic) on Thursday announced his resignation as the Minister of Education effective tomorrow (Friday).

He announced his decision to quit at a press conference at 4.30 pm at his ministry office here.

Maszlee, 45, who is the MP for Simpang Renggam, had spent the better part of this morning checking on the first day of school in the new year in Kuala Lumpur.

Maszlee said he made the decision after meeting and seeking the advice of Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.

“On the advice of the Prime Minister, who I look up to as a father, a leader and a statesman, and on the basis of party and government loyalty and discipline, I willingly and with a heavy heart, return the post of Education Minister to the Prime Minister effective Jan 3, 2020,” he said.

“I believe that as a visionary and a statesman, he better understands what is good for the country,” he added.

Maszlee said as a person without a political background, he is thankful to Dr Mahathir for giving him the opportunity to lead the Education Ministry over the last 20 months.

He said that throughout his tenure, he had done his best for the country and realised that with his background as an academic activist it was not easy for him to helm a big ministry.

Maszlee believed that he had laid a solid foundation and a clear direction for the ministry staff on the premise of “Education for All”.

“I believe this decision (to quit) is not the end, but a new beginning.

“Believe me, national reformation will never succeed without making the people’s welfare as the primary focus,” he said.

Maszlee also stated his undivided support and loyalty to the Prime Minister, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) and the Pakatan Harapan government.

Meanwhile, Maszlee said that even though the ministry had achieved various successes in the 20 months since Pakatan Harapan took over the country’s administration, more attention was given to controversial issues like the teaching of the Jawi script, Internet in schools and the free breakfast programme.

He said the ministry was often the target of the media and certain groups and politicians who raised sensational issues instead of the achievements made by the ministry.

“What happened in these 20 months could not be achieved in the years before. The changes in this period were so significant and beautiful for us to share.

“But unfortunately, they did not get the attention for news headlines. Many sensational headlines grabbed attention; sensitive issues that were deliberately played up were the main choice,” he said.

Maszlee had earlier highlighted the achievements of the ministry under his watch, among them that 90 per cent of the project to rehabilitate dilapidated schools was completed ahead of schedule with the progress displayed transparently on the ministry’s website, the zero dropout policy for undocumented children, reducing the workload of teachers and anti-corruption measures.

The press conference, which was also attended by his deputy Teo Nie Ching, received widespread media coverage following rumours swirling around hours before that that Maszlee would be quitting as Education Minister.

Immediately after the press conference, Maszlee was seen in tears and left the ministry’s compound driving his own car, a Perodua Myvi."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Corruption and other nefarious acts as ever witnessed in the nation today is as a result of the ‘get rich quick’ syndrome, she said.

She admonished all Nigerians to be fearful of Allah in all dealings because, no matter how long we stay on the surface of the earth, we shall all return to Him.

A social media post has claimed that Vice President Leni Robredo has released a statement about the Ayalas amid the water crisis the Manila Water has been facing.

However, KAMI learned that the claim was false.

In a report by Rappler, the post claimed that Robredo said she would rather pay the Ayalas instead of giving free water to the people.

“Siguro ang importante bayaran na lang 'yung mga Ayala. Kawawa naman sila malulugi dahil lang gusto nating makalibre ng tubig,” it read in the photo.

However, Rappler reported that the Vice President never said such a statement.

Robredo’s spokesperson, Barry Gutierrez, has clarified the issue and said, “The Vice President never said anything even remotely similar to this.”

“It follows the pattern of fake and outrageous quotes being attributed falsely to the VP on social media, as part of an obvious and deliberate effort to damage her reputation,” he added.

On December 15, 2019, Robredo said on her radio show Biserbisyong Leni that she supported a review of the deals between water concessionaires. However, she warned them to be careful so that they will not drive away investors.

Leni Robredo is the 14th Vice President of the Philippines and the second woman to ever assume the post. She is the widow of the late Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo.

As of 5 p.m., approximately 400 BC Hydro customers were still without electricity, according to the energy provider.

On the South Island, 367 BC Hydro customers are without power after a tree came down across power lines in the West Trimmer Place area, in between Sooke and Jordan River.

As of the late afternoon, BC Hydro crews were onsite at the West Trimmer Place outage.

On Thursday, Environment Canada issued weather warnings for North, East and West Vancouver Island. The weather alerts warned of heavy rainfall expected in all three regions which could cause localized flooding in low-lying areas.

In the hardest-hit areas, Environment Canada is predicting 100 to 150 millimetres of rain to fall on West and North Vancouver Island.

The weather agency says that rains are expected to ease Friday night but continue into the weekend.

While Victoria itself is not under a storm warning, Environment Canada has placed a special weather statement for the Greater Victoria region.

Residents of Greater Victoria should also expect precipitation, with a possibility of snow in higher elevation areas across the island.

A British teen who was found guilty of lying about being gang-raped during a holiday in Cyprus had her confession dictated to her by cops, according to a linguistics expert.

Dr Andrea Nini said it was “highly unlikely” the statement was written by the Brit alone.

The 19-year-old’s confession letter was a huge part of the case made against the Brit, who had claimed she was gang-raped by 12 Israelis while on holiday in Asia Napa back in July.

She later withdrew her initial statement, but the teen claims she only did so because she was pressurised into doing so by Cypriot cops before she was charged with public mischief.

But, Dr Nini said it was likely that an officer told the teen what to write in her confession letter, which was shared for the first time yesterday.

The expert told Mail Online: “I think it’s very surprising that the judge dismissed my evidence. I don’t see how it could have been faked.

“She would have to be a criminal mastermind.”

According to Mail Online, the Brit said she signed the statement at 1.29am in a desperate bid to come home.

During the trial, the Brit said: “This is not proper English. It is in Greek English.

“I’m very well educated, I’m going to university. It does not make grammatical sense. There is not one sentence there that an English person would write.”

It comes as the Brit teen called on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for help to bring her home.

Cyprus officials have rubbished claims the case was mishandled and said they had faith in the country’s courts and police force .

She told The Sun: ""Every second of this ordeal has been a waking nightmare,"" the woman said.

44599,fa35c9e8690f6ad5dfea7e68b30d20af,"I’ve always been more interested in the bottom end of the car market than in the upper ends. I’m not exactly sure why; perhaps it’s the same deep-seated insecurity and lack of self-esteem that makes me pick plastic cups over real glasses, because deep down maybe I’m not so sure I deserve to drink from glass, like a king or something? I’ll let my team of therapists figure that one out, but in the meantime we may as well compare the budget car options from 1967 to what cheapskates can buy today. I was a little surprised by the results, if I’m honest.

Advertisement

I’m getting my data from my prized February 1967 copy of Road Test, a wonderful old magazine that died out back in 1981.

I had assumed that, once the currency was converted from 1967 dollars to modern dollars, we’d see a much greater disparity between how much cars cost then and now, specifically, I assumed that entry-level cars were cheaper then.

Advertisement

While this does turn out to be true a bit, it’s by no means to the degree I would have guessed, and, when you factor in how dramatically better modern cars are when it comes to power, safety, convenience, comfort, economy, pretty much everything, the low end of the modern car market doesn’t seem so bad.

Unless you factor in intangible things like charm, which I do. In that case we live in the fucking dark ages, and 1967 seems like a beautiful dream. It’s no secret that I’d sacrifice each and every advantage of a modern car to daily drive anything from the 1967 list, but, it should be remembered, I’m kind of an idiot.



Oh, and these are all imports, too, but that actually squares up pretty well withe the cheapest cars available in the U.S. market today, which are mostly Nissans, Toyotas, Kias, Hyundais, and even the American cars, like the Chevy Spark, are actually Korean.

Advertisement

The cheapest car you can buy in the U.S. market today seems to be the Nissan Versa S sedan, at $14,730. This car isn’t one of my favorites, but let’s use it as a baseline to see how the low end from 1967 stacks up:

• Ford Consul Cortina 4-door: $1,966 then, $15,139.85 now



• Opel Kadett 37 4-door Deluxe $1,936 then, $14,908.82 now

• MG 1100 2-door: $1,898 then, $14,616.19 now

• Fiat 124 4-door: $1,838 then, $14,154.14 now

• Simca 1000 GLS: $1,787 then, $13,761.40 now

• Toyota Corona 4-door: $1,760 then, $13,553.48 now

• Volkswagen Beetle Deluxe: $1,717 then, $13,222.34 now

• Renault 10 4-door: $1,699 then, $13,083.72 now

• Datsun PL410 4-door, $1,666 then, $12,829 now

• Ford Anglia 2-door: $1,632 then, $12,567 now

• Fiat 1100 R 4-door: $1,599 then $12,313.64 now

• Fiat 600D: $1,267 then $9,756.96 now

So, yeah, you could get a viable, brand-new car for under the equivalent of ten grand back in 1967, but that meant a very small car making 29 horsepower and the safety in a wreck was comparable to falling off a third-story balcony holding a wicker basket of knives at your chest.

Personally, I’d pick a 29 HP charming little Italian deathtrap over a soul-crushing Versa in one of my likely-to-be-endangered heartbeats, no question.

Advertisement

But that doesn’t change the facts: yes, you could get cheaper cars in the past, but modern low-end cars, when you consider how good they are overall, are really impressive for the money you pay.

I do think we can do even better, though, and I bet a sub-$10,000 viable new car that is not a deathtrap is possible. The problem is, a car like that is almost impossible for carmakers to make profitable, so, sadly, I’m not going to hold my breath."," Threaten, not specified below",3
44616,ae4fb5c2ae26df78748b3cad370dffab,"ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s parliament on Thursday authorized the deployment of troops to Libya to support the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli that is battling forces loyal to a rival government seeking to capture the capital.

Turkish lawmakers voted 325-184 at an emergency session in favor of a one-year mandate allowing the government to dispatch troops amid concerns that Turkish forces could aggravate the conflict in Libya and destabilize the region.

The Tripoli-based government of Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj has faced an offensive by the rival regime in the east and forces loyal to commander Gen. Khalifa Hifter. The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into violent chaos rivaling the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last month that Sarraj requested the Turkish deployment after he and Sarraj signed a deal that allows Ankara to dispatch military experts and personnel to Libya. That deal, along with a separate agreement on maritime boundaries between Turkey and Libya, has led to anger across the region and beyond.

Ankara says the deployment is vital for Turkey to safeguard its interests in Libya and in the eastern Mediterranean, where it finds itself increasingly isolated as Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel have established exclusive economic zones paving the way for oil and gas exploration.

“A Libya whose legal government is under threat can spread instability to Turkey,” ruling party legislator Ismet Yilmaz argued in defense of the motion. “Those who shy away from taking steps on grounds that there is a risk will throw our children into a greater danger.”

The government has not revealed details about the possible Turkish deployment. The motion allows the government to decide on the scope, amount and timing of any mission.

Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation and discussed the situation in Syria and in Libya, the Turkish president’s office said soon after the vote. A brief statement said they discussed “the importance of diplomacy in solving regional issues.”

Egypt’s foreign ministry condemned “in the strongest language” the Turkish parliament’s authorization to deploy troops, saying Turkey would carry full responsibility for the negative effect it would have on the stability of the Mediterranean region.

Egypt, which neighbors Libya, has backed the regime in the country’s east.

The leaders of Greece, Israel and Cyprus denounced the move as a “dangerous threat to regional stability” and a “dangerous escalation” of the Libyan conflict that violates U.N. resolutions and undermines international peace efforts.

“The repercussions of such a reckless move will be dire for the stability and peace of the entire region,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a joint statement after signing a deal for a pipeline conveying east Mediterranean gas to Europe.

“Ankara should refrain from taking such action, which blatantly violates Libyan national sovereignty and independence.”

Numan Kurtulmus, deputy chairman of Turkey’s ruling party, welcomed parliament’s vote, telling CNN-Turk television the mandate “will ensure that the legal government in Libya remains in place and Turkey’s natural rights (in the Mediterranean) are maintained.”

He added that the mandate does not mean that “troops will be quickly sent tomorrow to conduct operations.”

Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told state-run Anadolu Agency that Turkey would send “the necessary number (of troops) whenever there is a need.” But he also said it would not dispatch forces if Libya’s rival government halts its offensive.

Turkey’s main opposition party, CHP, had vowed to vote against the motion arguing that the deployment would embroil Turkey in another conflict and make it a party to the further “shedding of Muslim blood.”

Before the vote, CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu called on the government to work for the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Libya.

Kurtulmus, the ruling party official, said the mandate does not exclude a peacekeeping force. He said, however, the government believes that U.N. peacekeeping missions were not successful in ending conflicts in the past.

Two other opposition parties voted against the motion.

“We cannot throw our soldiers in the line of fire of a civilian war that has nothing to do with our national security,” Aytun Ciray, a member of the opposition Good Party, said during the parliamentary debate.

However, Erdogan’s ruling party is in an alliance with a nationalist party, and the two held sufficient votes for the motion to pass.

Fighting around Tripoli escalated in recent weeks after Hifter declared a “final” and decisive battle for the capital. He has the backing of the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia, while the Tripoli-based government receives aid from Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

44671,2f8492c99481564d2b135e5693940baf,"Even before the protests came to the streets, a group of Indians had taken to Twitter — not to vent and rage (though they do that too), but to form an alternate government and fix everything the real government has broken. At least online.

In India, civil society and students are in the streets, defying curfew orders and courting arrest. At stake is the very essence of this 70-odd-year-old nation — democracy and secularism. Fed up with bad governance, a failing economy, an eroding democracy, and a systematic clampdown on fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the constitution, the straws that broke the camel’s back were two decisions that affect who is an Indian citizen.

Advertisement

Going from the world’s largest democracy to the world’s largest failing democracy has proved to be a surprisingly short journey. In half a decade, the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party-led government (now in its second term), fueled by the notion of the ideal Hindu nation, has followed an agenda to systematically undermine the independent institutions and symbols that form the bedrock of democracy — the judiciary and the constitution, for instance. They have used propaganda to fuel hate toward minorities, particularly Muslims. They have also effectively co-opted the media as a government mouthpiece and used it to whitewash all the signs of an economy gasping for air. Freedom of expression has never been more at risk in the history of this country.

Despite all attempts by the government to control it, the Internet essentially remains wild and free — except in areas where communications are suspended, of course, like Kashmir. Little surprise therefore that it has been the platform of choice for dissent, particularly creative criticism of the state. Thus, #AltSarkar (sarkar meaning government in a number of Indian languages) was born here — a Twitter lark, a space to take some sarcastic, clever potshots at the government by pretending to be . . . well, the government. Complete with an alt-prime minister (legend has it, she won in a landslide Twitter poll against the actual PM), an alt-cabinet, and alt-ministries, just like a real government. Debates and discussions on actual matters of public interest (somewhat unlike the real government in the present climate) take place here, too.

Advertisement

Vidyut Gore, a journalist and blogger (also maker of soaps and nurturer of carnivorous plants) who was voted in as alt-PM, says that the AltSakar campaign is all about the excellence of ideas. “Of putting the possibilities out there so people see what we are being deprived of in this mad power grab in politics,” she said. In other words, #AltSakar presents fairly obvious ideas and hopes that others will think, “Yes, this is how a government is supposed to be.”

As a space for insightful and informed exchanges on matters of public policy, #AltSarkar evolved into a platform for constructive dissent. As the website says, the participants aim to show that there is no shortage of people with the will and the ability to deliver good governance. Despite that, India as a society and a nation remain stuck in a vicious cycle of “theatrical announcements of drastic policies” that lead to adverse outcomes for which more drastic policies are sought.

But Gore acknowledges that #AltSakar also has its limitations.

“In the real world, it is a lot more complicated. Political parties have to survive. This means electoral wins, power games, and more,” Gore says. In India, perhaps as in many other places, there is a deep and complex nexus between politics, business, and the media. This, says the alt-PM, not only makes it easy to distract the masses from the real issues, but also undermines opposition and dissent.

Advertisement

“There is a limit to how much you can fool people,” Gore adds. “The TV can’t tell you you are full if you are hungry. It can’t tell you India is prospering if people in your society are squabbling over not affording maintenance money. Sooner or later people are going to see that the media is fiction. And at that point, they will simply dismiss it and get information about the world through more reliable means.”

#AltSarkar considers itself to be a reliable conveyor of information, and aims to inform by offending. But the sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek commentary on the doings of the actual sarkar has spilled into informed dialogues and critiques. Particularly for the middle and upper-middle classes, this dark humor and relatable satire might just be the push they need to turn their traditional apathy into action.

Gore warns, though, that there are no magic wands to fix the government. “We took a long time sliding into this state of affairs and it is going to take a lot of effort to get us out,” she says.

The question, then, is how does one find the building blocks for something new? Perhaps #AltSarkar’s first run — they are taking a break right now, but with plans for a comeback — has already planted a seed of change. After all, we are finally out on the streets.

US airlines operating in Pakistan airspace face risk of extremist activity: US aviation regulator

AIR News

United States aviation regulator FAA has warned American airlines and their pilots that there is risk involved in operating flights in Pakistan airspace due to extremist or militant activity.

The US Federal Aviation Administration in a notice to airmen has said there continues to be a risk to US civil aviation sector from attacks from airports and aircraft in Pakistan.

This is particularly for aircraft on the ground and aircraft operating at low altitudes, including during the arrival and departure phases of flights.

The FAA said some reports suggested that extremist or militant groups operating in Pakistan are suspected of having access to man-portable air defense systems or Manpads.

The regulator added that pilots or airlines must report safety or security incidents which may happen in Pakistan to the FAA

The attack was praised by US President Donald Trump's Republicans but elsewhere there were sharp warnings it could inflame regional tensions.

The Pentagon said Trump had ordered the ""killing"", after a pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy. Early Friday, a volley of missiles hit the airport, striking a convoy belonging to Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi paramilitary force with close ties to Iran.

""SEVERE REVENGE""



""Martyrdom was the reward for his ceaseless efforts in all these years,"" Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Twitter.

""With him gone, God willing, his work and his path will not be stopped, but severe revenge awaits the criminals who bloodied their foul hands with his blood and other martyrs' in last night's incident.""

Khamenei said he was killed by ""the most cruel of those on earth"".

""The lack of our devoted and dear general is bitter, but continuing the fight and achieving final victory will embitter the murderers and criminals even more.""

""Soleimani's martyrdom will make Iran more decisive to resist America's expansionism and to defend our Islamic values,"" said Iranian president Hassan Rouhani.

""With no doubt, Iran and other freedom-seeking countries in the region will take his revenge.""

""The brutality and stupidity of American terrorist forces in assassinating Commander Soleimani ... will undoubtedly make the tree of resistance in the region and the world more prosperous,"" said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a statement.

On Twitter he said the assassination of Soleimani was ""an extremely dangerous and foolish escalation.""

""The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,"" he said in the post.

""PRICE OF KILLING AMERICANS""



""In a display of resolve and strength, we struck the leader of those attacking our sovereign US territories,"" top House of Representatives Republican Kevin McCarthy said in a statement.

""Wow - the price of killing and injuring Americans has just gone up drastically,"" Senator Lindsey Graham, a close confidant of Trump, wrote on Twitter.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted a video on Twitter that he said showed Iraqis ""dancing in the street"" over Soleimani's killing.

""Iraqis - Iraqis - dancing in the street for freedom; thankful that General Soleimani is no more,"" Pompeo wrote, alongside footage of scores of people running along a road waving what appeared to be Iraqi flags and other banners.



""Qassem Soleimani was an arch terrorist with American blood on his hands,"" said Nikki Haley, former US ambassador to the United Nations, on Twitter. ""His demise should be applauded by all who seek peace and justice. Proud of President Trump for doing the strong and right thing.""



'RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump ""for acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively"" to eliminate the general.

""Just as Israel has the right of self-defence, the United States has exactly the same right.""

""ADVENTURIST STEP""



""The killing of Soleimani ... was an adventurist step that will increase tensions throughout the region,"" the Russian foreign ministry was quoted as saying by news agencies RIA Novosti and TASS.

""Soleimani served the cause of protecting Iran's national interests with devotion.""

""This action can seriously aggravate the situation in the region,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said, according to a Kremlin readout of a phone conversation with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.



Konstantin Kosachev, head of the foreign affairs committee of parliament's upper house, said Soleimani's killing was a mistake that would hit back at Washington.

""Retaliatory strikes will certainly follow,"" he said on Facebook.



""COWARDLY US AGGRESSION""

The Syrian government accused Washington of trying to fuel conflict in the Middle East.

Syria is ""certain that this cowardly US aggression ... will only strengthen determination to follow in the path of the resistance's martyred leaders,"" a foreign ministry official was quoted as saying by the state news agency SANA.

'THREATEN PEACE AND STABILITY'

""Pakistan has viewed with deep concern the recent developments in the Middle East, which seriously threaten peace and stability in the region,"" the foreign ministry said.

""Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity are the fundamental principles of the UN Charter, which should be adhered to. It is also important to avoid unilateral actions and use of force.""

The foreign ministry in neighbouring India said: ""We have noted that a senior Iranian leader has been killed by the US. The increase in tension has alarmed the world.""

'AGAINST FOREIGN INTERVENTION'

""It is manifest that the operation carried out by the US will increase insecurity and instability in the region ... Turkey has always been against any foreign intervention in the region, assassinations and sectarian conflicts,"" the foreign ministry said.



GLOBAL APPEAL FOR RESTRAINT

There were several calls for de-escalation from within the US.

US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that the killing of Soleimani risks provoking a ""dangerous escalation of violence"".

""American - and the world - cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.""

Former US Vice-president Joe Biden said in his statement that President Trump had ""just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox"".

""Iran will surely respond. We could be on the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East.""

""Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war,"" said US Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose view mirrored fellow Senator Chris Murphy.



""One reason we don’t generally (assassinate) foreign political officials is the belief that such action will get more, not less, Americans killed,"" Murphy said on Twitter.

""That should be our real, pressing and grave worry tonight.""

Other nations also called for restraint.

""China has always opposed the use of force in international relations,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily press briefing.

""We urge the relevant sides, especially the United States, to remain calm and exercise restraint to avoid further escalating tensions.""

He added that Iraq's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity must be respected.



Britain's Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said London had ""always recognised the aggressive threat"" posed by Soleimani and his Quds Force, adding: ""Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate. Further conflict is none of our interests.""



""We have woken up to a more dangerous world,"" Amelie de Montchalin, France's Europe Minister, told French radio, saying President Emmanuel Macron would consult soon with players in the region.

""In such operations, when can see an escalation is under way, but what we want above all is stability and de-escalation,"" Montchalin said.

""All of France's efforts... in all parts of the world aim to ensure that we are creating the conditions for peace or at least stability,"" she added.

""Our role is not to take sides, but to talk with everyone,"" Montchalin said.

Iraqi shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who positions himself as a nationalist rejecting both US and Iranian interference in Iraq, called on all sides to behave with ""wisdom and shrewdness"".

""As the patron of the patriotic Iraqi resistance I give the order for all mujahideen, especially the Mehdi Army, Promised Day Brigade, and all patriotic and disciplined groups to be ready to protect Iraq,"" he said in a statement."," Threaten, not specified below",3

44850,315aa70edb861dee1a45647735ee8582,"(CNN) New evidence showing Donald Trump's direct role in pressuring Ukraine for political favors is dialing up the heat as Republicans launch their New Year push to shield the President in a swift Senate impeachment trial.

Trump's top Senate protector, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is expected to attempt to define the next phase of the drama on Friday morning with his first floor speech of 2020. It was not clear whether the aftermath of the stunning US strike to kill Qasem Soleimani, Iran's top military and intelligence officer in Iraq, would change plans on Capitol Hill. The attack has the potential to scramble political calculations in Washington, in addition to its huge global implications.

Whenever McConnell plays his next card, he is expected to push back on demands by Democrats to call senior current and former White House officials to testify in the trial after the President refused to allow them talk to House investigators.

McConnell's speech will ratchet up pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who presided over Trump's historic shaming last month but tried to bolster Democratic demands for new witnesses by declining to transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate. That means the trial -- once expected to start as soon as next week cannot yet start.

And calls for the Senate to broaden the investigation are resonating amid recent revelations that appear to bolster the impeachment case that Trump froze military assistance from Ukraine partly to coerce it to dig for dirt on his possible 2020 election rival Joe Biden.

Documents reviewed by the ""Just Security"" website show that a top White House budget official made clear the order to halt nearly $400 million in aid came directly from the President.

The story suggests that there could be new and damning bombshells in piles of official evidence that the President has refused to hand over to the House investigation. It offers a rationale why the White House might be keen to get the Senate trial over quickly before even more damaging evidence emerges.

""As part of our impeachment inquiry, the House subpoenaed these very documents,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a statement on Thursday. ""From their deeply incriminating character, we can now see why they were concealed: They directly corroborate witnesses who testified that military aid to Ukraine was withheld at the direction of the President and that the White House was informed doing so may violate the law.""

But Republicans claim that it is not the Senate's job to improve the impeachment case sent over from the House -- and point to the failure of Pelosi to launch court challenges to compel senior White House officials who Democrats now want called to the Senate to testify in the House probe.

Critical Capitol Hill battles

While the Senate trial is almost certain to acquit Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors, the Capitol Hill exchanges in the next few days represent a vital twist in the story.

Both sides are playing a game within a game -- seeking to mold a public narrative about the trial which could have vital political consequences only 11 months from Election Day.

Democrats are seeking to convince Americans that the GOP is cooking the trial to shield an unchained President guilty of committing a dangerous abuse of power -- soliciting foreign interference in a US election.

Republicans, welded inexorably to their norm-busting President owing to his stranglehold on GOP voters, are framing Pelosi's refusal to hand over articles of impeachment as proof Democrats have a weak case no matter how convincing the evidence delivered in testimony by career foreign policy officials.

The showdown reflects how the adversarial grouping of lawmakers and voters into two rival teams threatens Congress' capacity to wield its own constitutional powers in a dispassionate examination of Trump's conduct and whether it is worthy of removal.

The President, who denies all wrongdoing, insisted during his New Year retreat at his Florida resort that he doesn't ""really care"" if he has a Senate trial or not. But his frenzied two weeks of furious tweets and searing attacks on Democrats tell a story of an agitated commander-in-chief pining for an acquittal that he can portray as vindication and use to vault into election year.

""The Witch Hunt is sputtering badly, but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!,"" Trump tweeted on Thursday.

""If this.... had happened to a Presidential candidate, or President, who was a Democrat, everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more), and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY, far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!""

Pelosi's dilemma

Pelosi's withholding of the articles of impeachment was meant to increase the leverage of the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as he wrestles with McConnell over the shape of the impeachment trial.

The speaker did succeed in concentrating attention over the holiday break on the GOP's open efforts to protect Trump from charges he abused power and obstructed Congress' investigation.

Several top Republican senators, including McConnell, have warned that they will not play the role of impartial jurors during the Senate trial, drawing outrage from Democrats.

Their comments also discomforted several moderate Republican senators. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she was disturbed by the majority leader's pledge to work with the White House counsel to coordinate arrangements for the trial.

On Monday, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who faces a difficult reelection race, said on public radio in her state that it was ""inappropriate"" for senators to make up their mind before they had heard the evidence.

Collins also however backed McConnell's position that any decision on witnesses to be called should take place during the trial -- and not beforehand, as Schumer is demanding.

McConnell can only lose four GOP senators if plans for a trial come down to a series of majority votes in the chamber -- a dynamic that may have been on Pelosi's mind as she calculated her options late last year.

But while she can claim minor tactical victory in highlighting criticism of McConnell, the House has little capacity to force the Senate's hand. With McConnell apparently content to sit and wait for the articles -- and go on with confirming a relentless stream of conservative judges -- it's hard to see how Pelosi can engineer a strategic advantage.

Long game

Any plan designed to wait out McConnell, the self-confessed devotee of the long game, is unlikely to work. After all, he blocked President Barack Obama's Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland for 10 months, opening the way for Trump to construct a conservative majority on the nation's top bench.

Schumer is expected to follow McConnell with his own statement on Friday after spending the holidays holding a string of news conferences trying to pile up public pressure on his rival.

""Will the Senate hold a fair trial, or will it enable a cover-up?"" Schumer said on Monday. ""What are Sen. McConnell and President Trump afraid of if all the facts come out?""

Uncertainty about the opening of the Senate trial is an irritant for Democratic senators running for president, including New Jersey's Cory Booker, Vermont's Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar who must sit as jurors -- even as they battle it out in Iowa ahead of the first-in-the-nation causes next month.

Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of his party's leadership team in the chamber, predicted that the process would largely be completed in the next month, despite current wrangling.

""I think what's going to happen is pretty predictable,"" Blunt said on his home state's KSSZ radio station Tuesday. ""The President's been invited by the speaker to come and give the State of the Union speech on February 4th.

45015,45178238a47102d8433fe6b57f479483,"Tehran, Jan 3 (IANS) Gen Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) elite Quds Force, has been killed in US airstrikes in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, the IRGC confirmed on Friday.

In a statement, the IRGC said that Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the second-in-command of the Hashd Shaabi or the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), was also killed along with Soleimani in the strikes that targeted their vehicle on the Baghdad International Airport road, the Tehran-based Press TV reported.

The PMF has also confirmed the incident.

""The deputy head of the Hashd, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and head of the Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani, were killed in a US strike that targeted their car,"" it said in a statement on Friday.

The group had earlier said that its public relations director Mohammed Reza al-Jaberi and four other members were also killed after three Katyusha rockets struck a military base next to the Baghdad airport earlier on Friday.

The PMF described the attack as a ""cowardly US bombing"".

Meanwhile, the Pentagon said that Soleimani was killed ""at the direction of the President"".

""At the direction of the President, the US military has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani,"" the BBC quoted a Pentagon statement as saying.

""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The US will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.""

The strike comes days after protesters surrounded the US embassy in Baghdad, clashing with American forces at the scene.

US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said late on Thursday that Washington would not accept attacks against its personnel in the region, blaming Iran for the violence at the embassy.

Since 1998, Maj Gen Soleimani has led Iran's Quds Force - the IRGC's elite unit which handles clandestine operations abroad, said the BBC.

In that position Gen Soleimani played a key role bolstering Bashar al-Assad's Iranian-supported government in the Syrian Civil War, and in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq.

He was a hugely significant figure in the Iranian regime. His Quds Force reported directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

He first came to prominence in his country serving in the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.

Iran says U.S. will bear responsibility for the consequences of the killiings

The top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards-Quds Force, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, was assassinated in an airstrike just outside of the Baghdad airport shortly after midnight Thursday. The strike, which was ordered by President Donald Trump following the siege of the U.S. embassy in the Iraqi capital by members of Iranian-backed Shiite militias, also killed senior commanders of the militias, known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF).

Gen. Soleimani is widely recognized as the orchestrator of Iran's strategy to influence and shape Middle East politics through a string of proxy militias. His presence in Baghdad soon after the embassy siege is being linked to his control of the events.

Updated at 08:05 am EST, Jan. 3: President Trump, who had tweeted out the picture of the American flag soon after the news of the air strike broke, tweeted early morning Friday: ""Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!""

The U.S. embassy in Baghdad said all public consular operations are suspended until further notice. It added in a Facebook post that the U.S. Consulate General in Erbil is open for visa and American Citizen Services appointments.

President Trump has not commented directly on the assassination but tweeted an American flag after the news broke.

He told International Business Times: ""The s**t will hit the fan for a month or so, but Iran as a whole will rise up. The youth will take power. We didn't start a war we finished several.

U.S. troops have gone into alert in the Middle East.

Update at 22:03 EST: Pentagon confirmed the killing of Iran's most senior commander Qasem Soleimani. The Deparment of Defense said in a press release that the air strike was carried out at the direction of President Donald Trump to protect American lives.

It said Soleimani, the top commander of the Quds Force and Iranian Revolutionary Guards orchestrated the attack on a U.S. airbase in Kirkuk that killed an American contractor, and also the siege of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad by Iranian-backed Shiite militias.

At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months - including the attack on December 27th - culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel. General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week.This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.

Original story below:

A rocket strike on a convoy of vehicles near the Baghdad airport killed the leader of Iran's feared Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani, and senior commanders of the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Forces of Iraq on Thursday night, a source with the Iraqi security forces said.

The death of Gen. Soleimani, a key player in Mideast politics and the orchestrator of Iranian influence in the region through proxies, was confirmed by Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), which said its deputy head Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed.

The source, who is with the Iraqi security forces and wished to remain anonymous, told International Business Times that the rockets detonated simultaneously and appeared to target a convoy of vehicles that were outside of a facility that housed American and Iraqi counter-terrorism forces. He said Mohammed Redha Al-Jabri, a senior Popular Mobilization Force official, was also killed along with his associates. In all, the strike killed eight people.

The precision of the strikes pointed to a possible U.S. role, the source said. If that is confirmed, the strike would mark a sharp escalation in the tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The U.S. military scrambled helicopters following the attack soon after midnight, he said.

A source with the U.S. special operations community in Iraq said separately: ""There are indications that the attack was staged as the vehicles that were hit were in motion, the precision that the strike was carried out with could have been the work of a drone if you know what I mean?""

The PMF, or the Hashed as it is known, is an umbrella organization of various Iraqi Shiite militias backed by Iran. During the war, in 2016, the PMF was made into an independent military force reporting directly to the Iraqi prime minister.

The Quds Force is an arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Forces engaged in carrying out unconventional warfare across the world. Members of the Quds Force fought alongside the PMF against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

The Quds Force is also widely considered to be behind the many recent attacks in Syria and Iraq against U.S. forces and the attack that targeted oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.

The Quds Force is reported to have used the war against the Islamic State and the recent popular unrest in Iraq to smuggle in and hide ballistic missiles in Iraq and Syria. Those missiles are considered a threat to U.S. forces and allies if a shooting war breaks out with Iran, and also to Israel.

Israeli military jets have previously targeted Iranian facilities and weapons stockpiles in Syria.

The strike that took out Gen. Soleimani follows the recent siege on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad by pro-Iranian protesters Tuesday, Dec. 31. Tensions in the area have remained high as 750 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne division were sent to Kuwait shortly after the attack.

The siege was carried out in retaliation for U.S. air strikes on Iranian weapons caches in Iraq and Syria, following an attack on an U.S. base that killed an American contractor.

The Popular Mobilisation Front had given the call for the siege, saying it was a ""message"" to the Americans. President Donald Trump acted decisively following the siege and even threatened Iran that it will be held responsible for any damage to U.S. interests.", Accuse of aggression,3
45033,0d94f2205fff902c6675cd4382ba5bbb,"BAGHDAD, Iraq (UPDATED) – Top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani was killed Friday, January 3, in a US strike on Baghdad's international airport, Iran and the US confirmed, in a dramatic escalation of tensions between the two countries.

The Pentagon said US President Donald Trump ordered Soleimani's ""killing,"" after a pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy.

Following Soleimani's death, Trump tweeted an image of the US flag without any further explanation.

The pre-dawn developments mark the most major escalation yet in a feared proxy war between Iran and the US on Iraqi soil.

Early Friday, a volley of missiles hit Baghdad's international airport, striking a convoy belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi paramilitary force with close ties to Iran.

Just a few hours later, Iranian state television carried a statement by the Revolutionary Guard Corps saying Soleimani ""was martyred in an attack by America on Baghdad airport this morning.""

The Hashed confirmed that both Soleimani and its deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed in what it said was a ""US strike.""

""The deputy head of the Hashed, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and head of the Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, were killed in a US strike that targeted their car on the Baghdad International Airport road,"" it said.

The Hashed is a network of mostly-Shiite armed units, many of whom have close ties to Tehran but which have been officially incorporated into Iraq's state security forces.

The units joined forces to fight the Islamic State group in 2014, after many of them built up years of fighting experience during Iraq's war years, including against the US.

'Major decapitation strike'

Muhandis was the Hashed's deputy chief but widely recognized as the real shot-caller within the group.

Soleimani headed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force and also served as Iran's point man on Iraq, visiting the country in times of turmoil.

Both were sanctioned by the United States.

The Pentagon said Soleimani had been ""actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.""

It said it took ""decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani,"" but did not specify how.

Phillip Smyth, a US-based specialist in Shiite armed groups, told AFP the strike would have ""bigger"" ramifications than the 2011 US operation that killed Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and the 2019 American raid that killed Islamic State group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

""In terms of a decapitation strike, what just happened is the most major decapitation strike that the US has ever pulled off,"" said Smyth.

""There is no comparison,"" he added.

The developments come after an unprecedented attack on the US mission in Baghdad.

A mob of Hashed supporters surrounded the US embassy on Tuesday in outrage over American air strikes that killed 25 fighters from the network's hardline Kataeb Hezbollah faction, which is backed by Iran.

The US had acted in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

Trump had blamed Iran for a spate of rocket attacks targeting US forces as well as the siege at the embassy, saying: ""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.""

On Thursday, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told reporters there could be more attacks from Iran-backed groups but vowed American forces would respond.

""We are prepared to exercise self-defense, and we are prepared to deter further bad behavior from these groups, all of which are sponsored, directed and resourced by Iran,"" he said.

Oil prices soar

Ties between the US and Iran have deteriorated since Washington pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018.

It then reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran, aiming to choke off its oil exports.

Oil prices soared following Friday's attack, with Brent surging 4.4% to $69.16 and WTI jumping 4.3% to 63.84.

But the attack threatens to destabilize Iraq, which has close political and military ties with both Tehran and Washington.

The United States led the 2003 invasion against then-dictator Saddam Hussein and has worked closely with Iraqi officials since.

But its influence has waned compared with that of Tehran, which has carefully crafted personal ties with Iraqi politicians and armed factions, even during Saddam's reign.

45034,24735fa738deeefb6880b615c463a4e0,"Baghdad: In July 2018, after President Donald Trump warned Iran's president not to threaten the United States, a rejoinder came not from the Iranian leader but from a military figure perhaps even more powerful.

“It is beneath the dignity of our president to respond to you,” Major General Qassem Soleimani declared in a speech in western Iran. “I, as a soldier, respond to you.”

On Friday, Soleimani was reported killed in an airstrike in Baghdad.

The general, a once-shadowy figure who enjoyed celebrity-like status among the hard-line conservatives in Iran, was a figure of intense interest to people inside and outside the country.

It is not just that he was in charge of Iranian intelligence gathering and covert military operations, and regarded as one of its most cunning and autonomous military figures. He was also believed to be very close to the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and seen as a potential future leader of Iran.

That Soleimani was in Iraq when he was killed at age 62, at Baghdad International Airport, was not surprising.

He was in charge of the Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, a special forces unit that undertakes Iranian missions in other countries. He had been named to lead it in the late 1990s.

In that role, Soleimani was believed to be the chief strategist behind Iran’s military ventures and influence in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in the region and beyond. He was considered the most effective military intelligence official in the region.

A senior Iraqi intelligence official once told US officials in Baghdad that Soleimani had described himself as the “sole authority for Iranian actions in Iraq.”

In his speech denouncing Trump, he was even less discreet — and openly mocking.

""We are near you, where you can’t even imagine,"" he said. ""We are ready. We are the man of this arena.""

Well before the speech, US officials had learned to see Soleimani as a formidable adversary.

After the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein, the United States accused Soleimani of plotting attacks on US soldiers.

The general worked to expand Iran's influence in Iraq, tying down the US military. The Iranian government was determined to retain its influence in the region and felt threatened by the expanding US military presence on its western and eastern flanks.

And in 2011, the Treasury Department placed him on a sanctions blacklist, accusing him of complicity in what US officials called a plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington.

But at times, the adversary looked more like ally, however tenuous the relationship. US officials cooperated with the Iranian general in Iraq to reverse gains made by the Islamic State — a mutual enemy.

At the height of the Iraq War, as the Quds Force under Soleimani armed and trained Shiite militias in Iraq, the general was stoking violence and then mediating the conflict so he could make himself indispensable and keep the Iraqis off balance, former US officials have said.

According to a June 2008 cable written by Ryan Crocker, then the US ambassador to Baghdad, Soleimani played a role in brokering a cease-fire that enabled the battered Shiite militias in the Sadr City neighborhood of Baghdad, which Iran was supporting, to withdraw.

In 2015, Soleimani was in the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, commanding Iraqi Shiite militias that were trying to recapture it from ISIS fighters. U.S. warplanes belatedly joined that campaign.

Soleimani also caught the imagination of ordinary Iranians. He came to prominence during Iran’s bloody eight-year war with Iraq. As a Revolutionary Guards’ commander, he gained a reputation for leading reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines.

“For Qasem Soleimani, the Iran-Iraq war never really ended,” Crocker once said in an interview. “No human being could have come through such a World War I-style conflict and not have been forever affected. His strategic goal was an outright victory over Iraq, and if that was not possible, to create and influence a weak

“At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qassem Soleimani,” the Pentagon said in a statement.

“This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” it said, adding that the United States would continue to take necessary action to protect Americans and interests around the world.

The Pentagon said that Soleimani had “orchestrated” attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the past few months and approved the “attacks” on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad this week.

U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Soleimani had been killed in a drone strike in Baghdad.

One U.S. official said that Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also believed to have been killed in the strike, according to initial information, though he was not the primary target.

The official said the Pentagon was aware of the possibility of an Iranian response and U.S. military officials were ready to defend themselves. The official did not rule out additional U.S. troops or military assets going to the region.

Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said while Soleimani was “an enemy of the United States,” the killing could put more Americans at risk.

“One reason we don’t generally (assassinate) foreign political officials is the belief that such action will get more, not less, Americans killed,” Murphy said on Twitter.

“That should be our real, pressing and grave worry tonight,” he said.

Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said that Soleimani’s death “should be applauded by all who seek peace and justice.”

Earlier on Thursday, before the strike, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said there were indications Iran or forces it backs may be planning additional attacks, warning that the “game has changed” and it was possible the United States might have to take preemptive action to protect American lives.", Accuse of aggression,3

But a new brand claims to have all but solved that problem — and has made $1 million in just 12 months in the process.

Sydney women Kay Howitt and Lynne Tramonte have been friends for decades, and after working in the swimwear industry for most of their careers, they decided to launch their own label around a year ago.

Their boutique swim and resort brand Monte & Lou has already raked in close to $1 million in sales — but the company has also recently signed a lucrative deal with leading Australian department store David Jones.

RELATED: Tradie’s genius $2m-a-month idea RELATED: Mates solve office headache

Monte & Lou will launch its range, including an exclusive print, in 15 David Jones stores across the country from July 31.

The new partnership will also double Monte & Lou’s turnover for the three key months of August, September and October alone to nearly $600,000.

The co-founders said the deal would lead to a “direct increase on sales volume as well as dollar value” and also boost the brand’s exposure in Australia.

They said the reasons behind Monte & Lou’s dramatic and rapid growth included their experience in the industry, the quality of the garments — and their exclusive “quick dry technology” that eliminates the “gross feeling” of sitting in wet swimmers.

“Our luxurious exclusive printed and plain fabrics are lightweight and engineered to provide a garment that not only feels beautiful against your skin but is also quick to dry which means no more sitting in a soggy swimsuit,” co-founder and creative director Kay Howitt said.

“All our garments are fully lined in our exclusive smooth-to-touch nylon elastane which sculpts the body and feels like silk.”

Ms Howitt said the pair had worked together on some of the country’s biggest swimwear brands — including Seafolly and Megan Gale’s Isola — for decades before going it alone.

The women have such extensive experience several Australian retailers specifically asked Ms Howitt to start her own label, which is how the idea was hatched.

“Kay and I have a friendship that has spanned 35 years — we’ve worked and collaborated together, particularly in the swimwear industry, for that many years,” Ms Tramonte told news.com.au.

“We have this passion for swimwear, and we’ve known each other as friends and colleagues for so long that it seemed natural (to start a business).

“Retailers we worked with were asking Kay to come up with her own brand, so it really started from there and from us being friends and having the skills to be able to do it. We had so much experience we were able to hit the ground running.”

Ms Howitt, a breast cancer survivor, said her experience had given her a valuable insight into how to create garments that made Aussie women feel good about themselves.

“I’m a breast cancer survivor, so I understand it can be quite difficult selecting swimwear and finding something you feel good in because there are a lot of changes going on,” she said.

“Having that first-hand experience to those types of challenges helped me in my design. I completely understand that if you select something that’s the right style and that suits you, it really lifts your self-confidence and helps you get back to enjoying your life.”

Ms Tramonte said the pair always hoped to have their line stocked in David Jones stores, and the deal was a “game changer”.

“David Jones was part of our strategy, and we hoped to be there one day, but we didn’t realise how quickly it would happen,” she said.

“It is an iconic Australian department store, so there’s no higher achievement for us — it’s very, very exciting.”

The pair said they aimed to double their business over the next two years and secure deals with international distributors.

“We want to take the Aussie holiday lifestyle to the world,” Ms Howitt said.

45189,fe19ce800b5991a8c4474031e2511bb8,"REGINA -- Environment and Climate Change Canada issued snow squall warnings for several areas in southern Saskatchewan on Thursday afternoon.

The storm started moving through southeastern parts of the province around 4 p.m.Thursday due to a cold front tracking northwest to southeast through that corner of the province.

“I’ve been doing this for years. I don’t remember ever having snow squall warnings in the forecast in the prairies,” said CTV Regina’s Weather Specialist, Warren Dean. “It doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, but I’m just saying I cant remember it.”

According to Dean, snow squalls are defined by sudden heavy snowfall, blowing wind, strong, gusting winds, and whiteout conditions. “Squalls last 60 minutes or less. Why is it not a blizzard? Because blizzards have to have the same conditions but for four or more hours. So it’s just the time differential that makes it a squall or a blizzard.”

“Visibilities will be rapidly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow,” according to a weather alert issued by Environment Canada. “Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions.”

According to the Highway Hotline, travel was not recommended on several roads in the area. But Environment Canada says conditions will improve later this evening as the fast-moving storm passes through the region.

“We’ve already seen some areas to the west come off,” said Dean. “It’s starting to break down a little bit, but that doesn’t mean conditions are improving. Obviously, road conditions are deteriorated, visibility is reduced and that’s going to be the case right through tonight into parts of tomorrow until crews can get out there and clean it off. So if you don’t have to travel throughout these areas, don’t.“"," Threaten, not specified below",3

""Martyrdom was the reward for his ceaseless efforts in all these years,"" Khamenei said on his Farsi-language Twitter account in reference to Soleimani, also declaring three days of mourning.

""With him gone, God willing, his work and his path will not be stopped, but severe revenge awaits the criminals who bloodied their foul hands with his blood and other martyrs' in last night's incident.""

Gold Futures gained 1.1% to $1,544.25 by 1:45 AM ET (05:45 GMT).

The gains came after reports said a U.S. airstrike on Baghdad killed Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian general who led the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds force.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has vowed that “severe retaliation” awaits those who killed the commander, Bloomberg said on Friday.

Notice to US Shareholders

The issue of the shares in New Topco relates to shares of a Jersey company and has been effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under the laws of England and Wales. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to proxy solicitation or tender offer rules under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, the scheme of arrangement is subject to the disclosure requirements, rules and practices applicable in the United Kingdom to schemes of arrangement, which differ from the requirements of US proxy solicitation or tender offer rules.

Neither the shares in New Topco, nor the Consideration Shares proposed to be issued by Bovis Homes, have been, and nor will they be, registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") or under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States. Accordingly, neither the shares in New Topco nor the Consideration Shares may be offered, sold, resold, delivered, distributed or otherwise transferred, directly or indirectly, in or into the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. The shares in New Topco have been issued and the Consideration Shares are to be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof. Galliford Try Shareholders who will be affiliates of Bovis Homes after completion of the Transaction will be subject to certain US transfer restrictions relating to the Consideration Shares to be received in connection with the Transaction.

The New Galliford Try Shares have not been and are not required to be registered under the Securities Act. The New Galliford Try Shares should not be treated as ""restricted securities"" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act and persons who receive New Galliford Try Shares (other than affiliates) may resell them without restriction under the Securities Act.

For the purposes of qualifying for the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 3(a)(10), Galliford Try has advised the Court through counsel that its sanctioning of the scheme of arrangement will be relied upon by New Topco and Bovis Homes as an approval of the scheme of arrangement following a hearing on its fairness to Galliford Try Shareholders.

It may be difficult for US Shareholders to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the US federal securities laws, since New Galliford Try, Bovis Homes and Galliford Try are located in countries other than the United States, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. US Shareholders may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's judgment.

None of the securities referred to in this announcement have been approved or disapproved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission in the United States or any other US regulatory authority, nor have such authorities passed upon or determined the adequacy or accuracy of the information contained in this announcement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States."," Threaten non-force, not specified below",3

California's Minimum Wages and Exempt Salary Thresholds Increase in 2020

SB 3, enacted in the 2015-2016 legislative session, sets forth a schedule for minimum wage increases through 2023.

Beginning Jan. 1, 2020, for employers with 26 employees or more, the minimum wage will increase from $12 per hour to $13 per hour, and the exempt annual salary threshold will increase from $49,920 to $54,080.

For employers with 25 employees or less, the minimum wage will increase from $11 per hour to $12, and the exempt annual salary threshold will increase from $45,760 to $49,920.

AB 5 – Codification and Expansion of Strict ABC Test for Independent Contractor Status

As discussed in a previous alert, AB 5 codifies the strict ""ABC"" test for employee versus independent contractor classification adopted by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles (Dynamex), 4 Cal. 5th 903 (2018). Dynamex was limited to California Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) Wage Order violations. But AB 5 expands the reach of the ""ABC"" test generally to Labor Code violations, as well as to California unemployment insurance and workers' compensation proceedings.

The codified test in the newly created Section 2750.3 of the Labor Code provides that a person providing labor or services for remuneration shall be considered an employee rather than an independent contractor unless the hiring entity demonstrates that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

A. the person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of work and in fact

B. the person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business

C. the person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation or business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed

AB 5 includes seven categories of exemptions for 1) specific occupations, 2) certain contracts for ""professional services,"" 3) certain real estate licensees and repossession agencies, 4) certain bona fide business-to-business contracting relationships, 5) certain relationships between contractors and individuals working under a subcontract in the construction industry, 6) certain relationships between referral agencies and service providers, and 7) certain relationships related to motor club services. AB 170, also passed signed into law this legislative session, created additional exemptions for a newspaper distributor working under contract with a newspaper publisher, and a newspaper carrier working under contract either with a newspaper publisher or newspaper distributor.

The ""exemptions"" are not true carve-outs – an individual whose work meets the exemption requirements is not automatically an independent contractor. Rather, an individual whose work meets the exemptions means that the ABC test does not apply, but the hiring party must still be able to demonstrate that contractor status is appropriate under Borello and/or by other statutory provisions as specified in the bill.

AB 5 specifically provides that it ""does not constitute a change in, but is declaratory of, existing law, with regard to wage orders of the [IWC] and violations of the Labor Code related to wage orders."" Thus, the strong indication is that the ABC test will apply retroactively, at least as to wage and hour claims. However, AB 5 also provides that the exemptions in categories 1 through 7 above will apply retroactively to existing claims and actions to the maximum extent permitted by law.

In addition to adding Section 2750.3 to the Labor Code, AB 5 also amends Section 3351 of the Labor Code, the workers' compensation definition of ""employee."" AB 5 provides that for purposes of workers' compensation, ""employee"" will include individuals who are employees under Section 2750.3 ""[b]eginning on July 1, 2020,"" but that the subdivision ""shall not apply retroactively.""

AB 5 also amends Section 621 of the Unemployment Insurance Code to restate the ABC test as one of the definitions of ""employee"" for unemployment insurance purposes. However, there is no similar statement as to retroactivity and, given that the addition will not become effective until Jan. 1, 2020, it remains to be seen whether the ABC test will apply retroactively for unemployment insurance purposes.

AB 9 – Statute of Limitations for Filing Complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment Extended from One Year to Three Years

Under current law, a person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful practice under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) must generally file a verified complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) within one year from the date upon which the alleged unlawful conduct occurred. AB 9 extends this this timeframe to three years subject to specified exceptions.

SB 778 – Harassment-Prevention Training Compliance Deadline Extended for Smaller Employers and Nonsupervisory Employees to Jan. 1, 2021

The FEHA requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide sexual harassment prevention training to all supervisory employees within six months of their assumption of a supervisory position and once every two years.

SB 1343, which as passed in the 2017-2018 legislative session, extended training requirements to small employers and to nonsupervisory employees. More specifically, the bill required that by Jan. 1, 2020, employers with five or more employees provide at least two hours of sexual harassment prevention training to supervisory employees, and at least one hour of sexual harassment prevention training to nonsupervisory employees within six months of their assumption of a position.

SB 778 extends this compliance date to Jan. 1, 2021. The bill makes clear that an employer who has provided this training in 2019 is not required to provide it again until two years thereafter.

AB 51 – Restrictions on Applicant/Employee Waiver of Rights, Forums and Procedures for Alleged Violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and Labor Code

[UPDATE: On Dec. 30, 2019, a Temporary Restraining Order Issued to Prevent the Enforcement of AB 51 Pending Resolution of a Preliminary Injunction Motion to be Heard on Jan. 10, 2020]

AB 51, aimed at curbing mandatory employment arbitration agreements, adds Section 432.6 to the Labor Code. Section 432.6 prohibits employers from requiring applicants or employees from waiving any rights, forums or procedures for alleged violations of the FEHA or Labor Code, as a condition of employment, continued employment or the receipt of any employment-related benefit. AB 51 prohibits threatening, retaliating or discriminating against for refusal to consent to any such waiver.

AB 51 applies to agreements entered into or extended on or after Jan. 1, 2020, but does not apply to post-dispute settlement agreements or negotiated severance agreements.

By its express language, the bill is not intended to invalidate a written arbitration agreement that is otherwise enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act.

Employers should note that on Dec. 6, 2019, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among other parties, filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California seeking to invalidate AB 51 as preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act.

UPDATE: On Dec. 30, 2019, a U.S. District Court judge issued a Temporary Restraining Order to prevent the enforcement of AB 51 pending resolution of a preliminary injunction motion to be heard on Jan. 10, 2020. Employers should carefully monitor the outcome of this preliminary injunction motion which, if granted, would halt the enforcement of AB 51 pending the outcome of the federal lawsuit on the merits.

SB 707 – Strict Enforcement and Penalties for Failure to Timely Comply with Arbitration Fee Provisions in Arbitration Agreements

SB 707 is an arbitration agreement enforcement provision that creates strict penalties for failure to comply with the agreement, particular the timely payment of any arbitration fees and costs. Specifically, it provides that any drafting party to an arbitration agreement that fails to pay the fees needed to commence or continue arbitration, within 30 days after such fees are due, is held to have materially breached the agreement and, as such, is in default and waives its right to compel arbitration.

SB 707 further provides remedies to employees for such a material breach of the arbitration agreement. In particular, it enables the employee to remove the matter to court or move to compel arbitration. For instance, if the drafting party fails to pay the required arbitration fees to continue an arbitration that is currently in progress, the employee can move the matter to court; seek a court order compelling payment of the fees; continue the arbitration and permit the arbitrator to seek collection of their fees; or pay the costs and fees and seek them from the drafting party at the conclusion of the arbitration regardless of the outcome of the arbitration. SB 707 also provides for the tolling of the statute of limitations with regard to all claims brought in the arbitration.

SB 707 also imposes mandatory monetary sanctions on any drafting party found to be in default of an arbitration through such a failure to pay the arbitration fees and costs. Most notably, it also allows the court or arbitrator to impose evidentiary, terminating or contempt sanctions. Lastly, SB 707 requires private arbitration companies to collect and report aggregate demographic data of all arbitrators.

Accordingly, employers should pay careful attention to timely pay any arbitration fees and costs in order to preserve its right to arbitration and avoid any potential sanctions.

AB 25 – One-Year Exemption for Certain Applicant- and Employee-Related Data under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) relates to the collection, use and protection of consumer data. While the CCPA goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2020, AB 25 exempts certain applicant- and employee-related data collected by businesses covered under the CCPA until Jan. 1, 2021. Despite this one-year exemption, covered businesses must still provide certain disclosures to applicants and employees regarding the collection and sharing of personal information, and can be subject to private lawsuits in the event of certain data breaches.

AB 673 – Employees May Now Recover Statutory Penalties for Employer's Late Payment Wages During Employment

Under current law, Labor Code section 210 provides that only the Labor Commissioner may recover civil penalties for employer violations of the Labor Code Sections 201.3, 204, 204b, 204.1, 204.2, 205, 205.5, and 1197.5, which includes late payment of wages during employment. AB 673 amends Section 210 to allow employees to sue employers directly for statutory penalties under Section 210 for violations of the aforementioned Labor Code sections, as well as Section 204.11, at the following rates: 1) for any initial violation, $100 for each failure to pay each employee; 2) for each subsequent violation, or any willful or intentional violation, $200 for each failure to pay each employee, plus 25 percent of the amount unlawfully withheld.

AB 673 also specifies that an employee may only recover either statutory penalties under Labor Code Section 210, or civil penalties under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (PAGA) for violations of the same violations. In other words, there will be no double recovery of penalties arising from the same Labor Code violation.

AB 749 – Restrictions on the Use of ""No-Rehire"" and ""No Future Employment"" Clauses in Settlement Agreements

A common type of term in settlement agreements arising from a dispute between an employee and an employer, especially when the employee is no longer employed by the employer, is one that specifies that the employee is not to apply for a position with the employer in the future, makes clear that the employee has no guarantee of future employment with the employer, or establishes that the employer does not have to consider any application for employment submitted by that employee. AB 749 sharply restricts, if not precludes, the use of these types of clauses.

AB 749 adds Section 1002.5 to the Code of Civil Procedure. The new Section 1002.5 provides that settlement agreements resolving employment disputes ""shall not contain a provision prohibiting, preventing, or otherwise restricting a settling party that is an aggrieved person from obtaining future employment with the employer against which the aggrieved person has filed a claim[.]"" Any provision of a covered agreement entered into after Jan. 1, 2020, which violates Section 1002.5 is void as a matter of law and void as against public policy.

The section does not preclude the employer and employee from entering into an agreement that ends the employment relationship. Also, an employer may restrict future employment opportunities or rehire eligibility with the employer when the employer has made a good-faith determination that the aggrieved employee engaged in sexual harassment or sexual assault. Finally, nothing in the section requires an employer to employ or rehire a person if there is a legitimate non-discriminatory or non-retaliatory reason for terminating the employment relationship or refusing to rehire the person.

SB 142 – Expanded Lactation Accommodation Requirements

SB 142 amends Sections 1030, 1031 and 1033 of the California Labor Code and adds a new Section 1034. In general, these changes now require all employers to provide an employee a break to express breast milk for the employee's infant child each time they need to express milk. The breaks may run concurrently with any break already provided to the employee, but any such breaks that do not run concurrently with another break may be unpaid. To accommodate such breaks, employers must provide the employee with a clean and safe room or other location to express milk in private that is close to the employee's work area. The room or location must satisfy certain conditions, including 1) contain a surface to place a breast pump and personal items; 2) contain a place to sit; and 3) have access to electricity or another device that enables the use of an electric or battery-powered breast pump. The room cannot be a bathroom. In addition, employers must provide access to a sink with running water and a refrigerator suitable for storing milk (or, if a refrigerator cannot be provided, some other suitable cooling device) that is close to the employee's workspace. Multiple employers in the same building can provide a shared space within the building/worksite if an employer cannot provide a lactation location within the employer's own workspace.

Failure to comply with the new Labor Code requirements constitutes a violation of Labor Code Section 226.7, which requires the employer to pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee's regular rate of pay for each workday that an accommodating break period is not provided. In addition, an employee may file a complaint under Labor Code Section 98 for employer violations of the new Labor Code requirements. Employers are prohibited from discharging or in any way retaliating against an employee for exercising or attempting to exercise rights under the new Labor Code requirements. If the Labor Commissioner determines that a violation of the requirements has occurred, the Labor Commissioner may impose a penalty of $100 for each day an employee is denied reasonable break time or an adequate space to express milk.

Under new Labor Code Section 1034, employers must also develop and implement a policy regarding lactation accommodation that includes, in part, 1) a statement about the employee's right to request lactation accommodation and the process to make such a request, and 2) a statement about the employee's right to file a complaint with the Labor Commissioner for any violation of such right. The policy must be provided in the employee handbook or set of policies the employer provides to employees.

Employers with fewer than 50 employees may qualify for an exemption if it can demonstrate that complying with the requirement would impose an undue hardship, but the employer must still make reasonable efforts to provide employees with a room or other location to express milk in private.

SB 188 – CROWN Act: Race Discrimination Protections Expanded to Traits Historically Associated with Race Such As Hair Textures and Protective Hairstyles

SB 188, known as the CROWN Act, amends Section 212.1 of the California Education Code and Section 12926 of the California Government Code to expand the definition of ""Race"" to include traits historically associated with race, such as hair texture and ""protective hairstyles."" The term ""protective hairstyles"" is defined to include, but not be limited to, ""braids, locks, and twists."" As a result, workplace dress codes and grooming policies may not prohibit such ""protective hairstyles,"" otherwise such dress codes/grooming policies will be found to discriminate on the basis of race.

SB 229 – Expedited Procedural Requirements For The Administrative Enforcement of Unlawful Retaliation Citations

SB 229, which amends Section 98.74 of the Labor Code, expands the administrative enforcement of the Labor Commissioner's citations for enforcement of the anti-retaliation provisions of the Labor Code. Specifically, if the Labor Commissioner investigates a retaliation complaint and determines that the employer violated the Labor Code, the Labor Commissioner may issue a citation to the person or employer who is responsible for the violation. SB 229 establishes expedited procedural requirements and deadlines for the Labor Commissioner to file such citations with the court for judicial enforcement and the collection of remedies. It also sets out the procedural requirements for anyone who wishes to appeal such a citation. Specifically, if the employer does not request an informal hearing with the Labor Commissioner within 30 days after service of the citation, the citation becomes final, and 10 days later, the Labor Commissioner is required to apply for an entry of judgment.

SB 688 – Labor Commissioner's Citation Authority Expanded to the Recovery of ""Contract Wages""

SB 688 amends Section 1197.1 of the Labor Code in a couple of ways. First, it expands the Labor Commissioner's citation authority to include citations for recovery of ""contract wages,"" which are wages, based on an agreement, in excess of the applicable minimum wage for regular, nonovertime hours. Accordingly, the Labor Commissioner can now hold employers liable for the failure to pay wages set by contract, regardless of whether all of the hours were actually paid at or above the minimum wage, and in essence now permits the Labor Commissioner to enforce breach of contract claims for wages. As such, employers should ensure that any agreement setting out an employee's wages is clearly communicated and, most importantly, that the employee accurately paid, pursuant to the agreement, for all of the hours worked.

SB 688 also amends the procedure involved in contesting the assessment of such a civil penalty. As it exists, California law requires an employer seeking to file a writ of mandate with the court to contest the Labor Commissioner's assessment of a civil penalty to post an ""undertaking"" in a specified amount, some or all of which may be forfeited to the affected employee if the employer does not pay the court's judgment, regarding any wages or damages owed, within 10 days of the entry of judgment. SB 688 now provides that the ""undertaking"" will instead be forfeited to the Labor Commissioner for appropriate distribution.

President Donald Trump ordered the killing of the Iran Revolutionary Guards commander, who died Friday ""in a decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad,"" the Pentagon said.

""General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,"" the Department of Defense said in a statement.

""General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more."" Pompeo did not provide a source for the video or offer any details about where the images were filmed.

The strike at Baghdad's international airport also killed the deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

A pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy following deadly American air strikes on a hardline Hashed faction.

The US had called the strikes in response to a rocket attack days earlier that killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

The Pentagon said Soleimani had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the past months, including on December 27, the day the contractor was killed.

Iran Press TV

Thursday, 02 January 2020 10:57 PM

US President Donald Trump has warned his Turkish counterpart against sending troops to Libya hours after Turkey's parliament approved a bill allowing the government to do so.

The deployment Ankara says aims to shore up the UN-backed government in Tripoli, which has been under sustained attack since April by military strongman General Khalifa Haftar.

In early April, Haftar launched an offensive to capture the capital. Since then Tripoli's southern suburbs have been hit by deadly fighting.

In his phone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday, Trump warned against ""foreign interference"" in Libya, according to the White House.

The two also discussed the situation in Syria, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement.

""The leaders discussed bilateral and regional issues,"" Gidley said. ""President Trump pointed out that foreign interference is complicating the situation in Libya.""

Trump and Erdogan also called for de-escalation in Idlib, Syria, where Turkey has brought in a new column of military forces and hardware to be deployed in its observation posts there.

""The leaders agreed on the need for de-escalation in Idlib, Syria, in order to protect civilians,"" Gidley said.

Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said his country's military would not leave the posts in Idlib, according to a Britain-based war monitor.

The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that the column entered the Syrian territory through Kafr Lusin border crossing, and consisted of armored vehicles as well as trucks carrying logistics.

On Sunday, Akar said it is ""out of the question"" for Turkey to evacuate its military observation posts in Syria's Idlib.

""We respect the agreement reached with Russia and we expect Russia to abide by this agreement,"" he said in comments published on Sunday on the Turkish defense ministry's Twitter account.

On October 9, Turkish military forces and Ankara-backed militants launched a long-threatened cross-border invasion of northeastern Syria in a declared attempt to push militants from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) away from border areas.

Ankara views the US-backed YPG as a terrorist organization tied to the homegrown Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been seeking an autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey since 1984."," Threaten, not specified below",3

ICC president Alfredo Pascual said: “To be able to tap business opportunities in the evolving digital economy, digital transformation is key. This must be done or else, a company will be left behind.”

“The most successful businesses are the ones that constantly evolve and reinvent themselves to keep pace with advances in the outside world,” said Pascual, noting that businesses are under threat because of new and emerging technologies.

Pascual, former University of the Philippines president and PIDS trustee, pointed out that digital transformation will help businesses appreciate the importance of using their data in improving their marketing, operations, performance, and research and development.

Pascual noted that while bigger firms in the country have already embraced digital transformation, SMEs led by younger, more dynamic, and tech-savvy entrepreneurs are following closely, citing the growing Philippine start-up community as an example.

However, SMEs, in general, face a number of challenges that make it difficult for them to keep up with big corporations.

“Opportunities for SMEs are tremendous, but many are limited by their ability to grow because of lack of access to finance, business services, and information, and constrained access to markets beyond their immediate neighborhood,” Pascual explained.

He urged SMEs to use existing digital market places and online services to help them connect not only with local customers but with regional and global markets as well. However, these areas also need improvement, according to Pascual.

One major issue to resolve is the expensive and slow Internet connection in the Philippines. Pascual said that improving the competition among Internet service providers could help lower prices and increase bandwidth speed.

He also mentioned the need to strengthen the digital skills of Filipinos as well as expand their use of digital payments. More importantly, Pascual urged the government to lead by example and become more digital themselves."," Threaten, not specified below",3
45800,5647fc4dc6a2528a209da9ed9bc257e1,"“You will start the war but we will end it,” Qaseem Soleim­ani had told US Presid­ent Trump

Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, the top commander of the elite Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, helped Iran fight proxy wars across the Middle East by inspiring militias on the battlefield and negotiating with political leaders.

His death on Friday in a United States airstrike on his convoy at Baghdad airport marked the end of a man who was a celebrity at home and closely watched by the United States, Israel and Tehran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia.

The Pentagon said the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.

Soleimani was responsible for clandestine overseas operations and was often seen on battlefields guiding Iraqi Shia groups in the war against Islamic State.

Iran supreme leader vows ‘severe revenge’ for Soleimani killing

He was killed along with top Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Both men were seen as heroes in Iran’s fight against its enemies and state television heaped them with praise shortly after their deaths were announced.

The television showed footage of him with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and in war zones in military garb, including as a young high-school graduate commanding a unit in Iran’s war with Iraq in the 1980s.

After that, he rose rapidly through the ranks of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards to become chief of the Quds Force, a post in which he helped Iran form alliances in the Middle East as it came under pressure from US sanctions that have devastated the Islamic Republic’s economy.

The United States designated the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organisation in 2019, part of a campaign of maximum pressure to force Iran to negotiate on its ballistic missile programme and nuclear policy.

Soleimani had a pointed reply: any negotiation with the US would be “complete surrender.”

Soleimani’s Quds Force shored up support for Syrian President Bashir al Assad when he looked close to defeat in the civil war raging since 2011 and also helped militiamen defeat Islamic State in Iraq.

Its successes have made Soleimani instrumental to the steady spreading of Iran’s clout in the Middle East, which the United States and Tehran’s regional foes Saudi Arabia and Israel have struggled to keep in check.

Khamenei made Soleimani head of the Quds Force in 1998, a position in which he kept a low profile for years while he strengthened Iran’s ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad’s government, and Shia armed- groups in Iraq.

In the past few years, he has acquired a more public standing, with fighters and commanders in Iraq and Syria posting images on social media of him on the battlefield, his beard and hair always impeccably trimmed.

“WE ARE CLOSE TO YOU”

Soleimani’s growing authority within Iran’s military establishment was apparent in 2019 when Khamenei awarded him the Order of Zolfiqar medal, Iran’s highest military honour. It was the first time any commander had received the medal since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979.

In a statement after Soleimani’s death, Khamenei said harsh revenge awaited the ‘criminals’ who killed him. His death, though bitter, would double the motivation of the resistance against the United States and Israel, the Iranian leader said.

“Soleimani is … not a man working in an office. He goes to the front to inspect the troops and see the fighting,” a former senior Iraqi official, who asked not to be identified, said in an interview in 2014.

“His chain of command is only the Supreme Leader. He needs money, gets the money. Needs munitions, gets munitions. Needs material, gets material,” the former Iraqi official said.

Soleimani was also in charge of intelligence gathering and covert military operations carried out by the Quds Force and in 2018 he publicly challenged US President Donald Trump.

“I’m telling you, Trump, the gambler, I’m telling you, know that we are close to you in that place you don’t think we are,” said Soleimani, seen wagging an admonishing finger in a video clip distributed online.

“You will start the war but we will end it,” he said, with a checkered keffiya draped across the shoulders of his olive uniform.

“GETS WHAT HE WANTS”

Softly-spoken, Soleimani came from humble beginnings, born into an agricultural family in the town of Rabor in southeast Iran on March 11, 1957.

At 13, he traveled to the town of Kerman and got a construction job to help his father pay back loans, according to a first-person account from Soleimani posted by Defa Press, a site focused on the history of Iran’s eight-year war with Iraq.

When the revolution to oust the Shah began in 1978, Soleimani was working for the municipal water department in Kerman and organised demonstrations against the monarchy.

He volunteered for the Revolutionary Guards and, after the war with Iraq broke out in 1980, quickly rose through the ranks and went on to battle drug smugglers on the border with Afghanistan.

“Soleimani is a great listener. He does not impose himself. But he always gets what he wants,” said another Iraqi official, adding that he can be intimidating.

At the height of the civil war between Sunni and Shia militants in Iraq in 2007, the US military accused the Quds Force of supplying improvised explosive devices to Shia militants which led to the death of many American soldiers.

Soleimani played such a pivotal role in Iraq’s security through various militia groups that General David Petraeus, the overall head of US forces in Iraq at the time, sent messages to him through Iraqi officials, according to diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks.

After a referendum on independence in the Kurdish north in 2017, Soleimani issued a warning to Kurdish leaders which led to a withdrawal of fighters from contested areas and allowed central government forces to reassert their control.

He was arguably even more influential in Syria. His visit to Moscow in the summer of 2015 was the first step in planning for a Russian military intervention that reshaped the Syrian war and forged a new Iranian-Russian alliance in support of Assad.

US says it kills top Iranian commander Soleimani in air strike

His activities had made him a repeated target of the US Treasury: Soleimani was sanctioned by the United States for the Quds Force’s support for Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other armed groups, for his role in Syria’s crackdown against protesters and his alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States.

Soleimani’s success in advancing Iran’s agenda had also put him in the crosshairs of regional foes Saudi Arabia and Israel.

Top Saudi intelligence officials looked into the possibility of assassinating Soleimani in 2017, according to a report in The New York Times in 2018. A Saudi government spokesperson declined to comment, the Times reported, but Israeli military officials publicly discussed the possibility of targeting him.

Brittany McKinney, 28, faced a judge for the first time on Thursday; she didn’t say a word during the brief hearing.

McKinney’s sister and mother told WGHP it’s an extremely difficult and tragic time for the entire family.

Investigators said McKinney shot and killed her 10-year-old daughter Mkenzie and 2-year-old niece Serenity. She’s also accused of killing 61-year-old Jerry Griffin, who was living with the family on Sweet Birch Drive in Greensboro.

“She said, ‘I killed everybody. I shot everybody in the house,'” Delilah Merritt, McKinney’s sister, said. “She’s like, ‘My baby, my baby, I shot my baby.’ And then I said, ‘Where’s Serenity?’ and she said, ‘I shot her too.'”

That’s when Merritt called for a welfare check on McKinney’s home.

“I never thought she would do something like this,” she said.

Lisa Campos and her daughter Laila still can’t believe what happened a few houses down from them.

“They would play in the front of my house and stuff,” Campos said.

Neighbors Laila and Mkenzie rode the bus together to George C. Simkins Jr. Elementary School.

“We just became friends and she was really nice to me,” Laila said. “I’m going to miss her.”

A small mailbox makeshift memorial has popped up outside of where tragedy struck. There, friends and neighbors have put up pictures, cards, flowers and a bundle of purple balloons.

The grieving process for family and friends is only just beginning.

“I didn’t want to believe it,” Merritt said. “I still don’t.”

Merritt told WGHP she thinks her sister was just overwhelmed with life and it just became too hard for her.

Two militia leaders loyal to Iran also confirmed the deaths, including an official with the Kataeb Hezbollah, which was involved in the attack on the US Embassy this week.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis had arrived at the airport in a convoy to receive Soleimani whose plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria. The airstrike occurred as soon as he descended from the plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and his companions, killing them all.

Soleimani had been rumored dead several times, including in a 2006 airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and following a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad.

More recently, rumors circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria’s Aleppo.

In a statement issued here, Khamenei said the ""cruelest people on earth"" assassinated the ""honourable"" commander who ""courageously fought for year against the evils and bandits of the world"", reports the Tehran-based Press TV.

""His demise will not stop his mission, but the criminals who have the blood of General Soleimani and other martyrs of the Thursday night attack on their hands must await a vigorous revenge.

""... The continued fight and achievement of the final victory will make life bitterer for the murderers and criminals,"" he added.

Besides offering condolences to Soleimani's family, Khamenei also declared three days of mourning.

The IRGC said that Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the second-in-command of the Hashd Shaabi or the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), were killed in the US strike that targeted their vehicle on the Baghdad International Airport road.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the US attack as ""extremely dangerous and a foolish escalation"".

""The US' act of international terrorism, targeting and assassinating General Soleimani, the most effective force fighting IS, Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda, is extremely dangerous and a foolish escalation.

""The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,"" he said in a series of tweets.

Meanwhile, the PMF has also confirmed the incident, adding that its public relations director Mohammed Reza al-Jaberi and four other members were also killed after three Katyusha rockets struck a military base next to the Baghdad airport earlier on Friday.

It described the attack as a ""cowardly US bombing"".

President Trump have not officially commented on the development, but he posted a picture of the American flag on his Twitter handle.

Since 1998, Maj Gen Soleimani led Iran's Quds Force - the IRGC's elite unit which handles clandestine operations abroad.

Top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani was killed Friday in a US strike on Baghdad's international airport, Iran and the US confirmed, in a dramatic escalation of tensions between the two countries.

The Pentagon said US President Donald Trump ordered Soleimani's ""killing,"" after a pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy.

Following Soleimani's death, Trump tweeted an image of the US flag without any further explanation.

The pre-dawn developments mark the most major escalation yet in a feared proxy war between Iran and the US on Iraqi soil.

Early Friday, a volley of missiles hit Baghdad's international airport, striking a convoy belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi paramilitary force with close ties to Iran.

Just a few hours later, Iranian state television carried a statement by the Revolutionary Guard Corps saying Soleimani ""was martyred in an attack by America on Baghdad airport this morning.""

The Hashed confirmed that both Soleimani and its deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed in what it said was a ""US strike.""

""The deputy head of the Hashed, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and head of the Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, were killed in a US strike that targeted their car on the Baghdad International Airport road,"" it said.

The Hashed is a network of mostly-Shiite armed units, many of whom have close ties to Tehran but which have been officially incorporated into Iraq's state security forces.

The units joined forces to fight the Islamic State group in 2014, after many of them built up years of fighting experience during Iraq's war years, including against the US.

Muhandis was the Hashed's deputy chief but widely recognised as the real shot-caller within the group.

Soleimani headed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force and also served as Iran's pointman on Iraq, visiting the country in times of turmoil. Both were sanctioned by the United States.

The Pentagon said Soleimani had been ""actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.""

It said it took ""decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani,"" but did not specify how.

Phillip Smyth, a US-based specialist in Shiite armed groups, told AFP the strike would have ""bigger"" ramifications than the 2011 US operation that killed Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and the 2019 American raid that killed Islamic State group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

""In terms of a decapitation strike, what just happened is the most major decapitation strike that the US has ever pulled off,"" said Smyth.

""There is no comparison,"" he added.

The developments come after an unprecedented attack on the US mission in Baghdad.

A mob of Hashed supporters surrounded the US embassy on Tuesday in outrage over American air strikes that killed 25 fighters from the network's hardline Kataeb Hezbollah faction, which is backed by Iran.

The US had acted in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

Trump had blamed Iran for a spate of rocket attacks targeting US forces as well as the siege at the embassy, saying: ""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.""

On Thursday, US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper told reporters there could be more attacks from Iran-backed groups but vowed American forces would respond.

""We are prepared to exercise self-defence, and we are prepared to deter further bad behaviour from these groups, all of which are sponsored, directed and resourced by Iran,"" he said.

Ties between the US and Iran have deteriorated since Washington pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018.

It then reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran, aiming to choke off its oil exports.

Oil prices soared following Friday's attack, with Brent surging 4.4 per cent to $69.16 and WTI jumping 4.3 per cent to 63.84.

But the attack threatens to destabilise Iraq, which has close political and military ties with both Tehran and Washington.

The United States led the 2003 invasion against then-dictator Saddam Hussein and has worked closely with Iraqi officials since.

But its influence has waned compared with that of Tehran, which has carefully crafted personal ties with Iraqi politicians and armed factions, even during Saddam's reign."," Threaten, not specified below",3

The targeted killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force and the architect of Tehran’s proxy wars in the Middle East, could spiral into a far larger conflict between the U.S. and Iran.

The US Defense Department said it killed Soleimani because he “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.""

It also accused Soleimani of approving the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.

The attack took Congress by surprise. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Trump had “tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox"" while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned against ""provocative and disproportionate actions"" that could cause a ""dangerous escalation.""

Trump was on holiday at his company's golf resort in Palm Beach, Florida, but tweeted an American flag.

Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, called it ""a foolish escalation"" and while the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei declared three days of mourning and called for a ""harsh retaliation.""

Moqtada al-Sadr, the populist Iraqi cleric and former militia leader, said he was reactivating his former “Mahdi Army” that fought US troops during and after the 2003 invasion.

Basem Naim, a senior figure in Hamas, said the move “opens the doors of the region to all possibilities, except calm and stability.”

The US urged citizens to leave Iraq ""immediately"" and said all consular operations in Baghdad were are uspended. ""US citizens should not approach the embassy,"" the State Department said.

Who was Qassem Soleimani, the assassinated commander of Iran's overseas military forces?

The tensions take root in Trump’s decision in May 2018 to withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, struck under his predecessor, Barack Obama.

More recently, Tehran has seized oil tankers and shot down a U.S. military drone.

The airport strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, and five others, including the PMF's airport protocol officer, Mohammed Reda, Iraqi officials said.

A senior Iraqi security official said the drone strike took place near the cargo area after Soleimani left his plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and others. The official said the plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria.

Two officials from the PMF said Suleimani's body was torn to pieces in the attack, while they did not find the body of al-Muhandis. A senior politician said Soleimani's body was identified by the ring he wore.

It’s unclear what legal authority the U.S. relied on to carry out the attack. American presidents claim broad authority to act without congressional approval when U.S. personnel or interests are facing an imminent threat.

The Pentagon did not provide evidence to back up its assertion that Soleimani was planning new attacks against Americans.

Democratic Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Trump owes a full explanation to Congress and the American people.

""The present authorizations for use of military force in no way cover starting a possible new war. This step could bring the most consequential military confrontation in decades,"" Blumenthal said.

However, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said: ""I appreciate President Trump's bold action against Iranian aggression. To the Iranian government: if you want more, you will get more."""," Threaten, not specified below",3
46203,b96871bcfd1d37aa7ec994f371a9ec03,"Turkey's parliament on Thursday authorized the deployment of troops to Libya to support the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli that is battling forces loyal to a rival government seeking to capture the capital.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey’s parliament on Thursday authorized the deployment of troops to Libya to support the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli that is battling forces loyal to a rival government seeking to capture the capital.

Turkish lawmakers voted 325-184 at an emergency session in favor of a one-year mandate allowing the government to dispatch troops amid concerns that Turkish forces could aggravate the conflict in Libya and destabilize the region.

The Tripoli-based government of Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj has faced an offensive by the rival regime in the east and forces loyal to commander Gen. Khalifa Hifter. The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into violent chaos rivaling the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last month that Sarraj requested the Turkish deployment after he and Sarraj signed a deal that allows Ankara to dispatch military experts and personnel to Libya. That deal, along with a separate agreement on maritime boundaries between Turkey and Libya, has led to anger across the region and beyond.

Ankara says the deployment is vital for Turkey to safeguard its interests in Libya and in the eastern Mediterranean, where it finds itself increasingly isolated as Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel have established exclusive economic zones paving the way for oil and gas exploration.

“A Libya whose legal government is under threat can spread instability to Turkey,” ruling party legislator Ismet Yilmaz argued in defense of the motion. “Those who shy away from taking steps on grounds that there is a risk will throw our children into a greater danger.”

The government has not revealed details about the possible Turkish deployment. The motion allows the government to decide on the scope, amount and timing of any mission.

Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation and discussed the situation in Syria and in Libya, the Turkish president’s office said soon after the vote. A brief statement said they discussed “the importance of diplomacy in solving regional issues.”

Egypt’s foreign ministry condemned “in the strongest language” the Turkish parliament’s authorization to deploy troops, saying Turkey would carry full responsibility for the negative effect it would have on the stability of the Mediterranean region.

Egypt, which neighbors Libya, has backed the regime in the country’s east.

The leaders of Greece, Israel and Cyprus denounced the move as a “dangerous threat to regional stability” and a “dangerous escalation” of the Libyan conflict that violates U.N. resolutions and undermines international peace efforts.

“The repercussions of such a reckless move will be dire for the stability and peace of the entire region,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a joint statement after signing a deal for a pipeline conveying east Mediterranean gas to Europe.

“Ankara should refrain from taking such action, which blatantly violates Libyan national sovereignty and independence.”

Numan Kurtulmus, deputy chairman of Turkey’s ruling party, welcomed parliament’s vote, telling CNN-Turk television the mandate “will ensure that the legal government in Libya remains in place and Turkey’s natural rights (in the Mediterranean) are maintained.”

He added that the mandate does not mean that “troops will be quickly sent tomorrow to conduct operations.”

Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told state-run Anadolu Agency that Turkey would send “the necessary number (of troops) whenever there is a need.” But he also said it would not dispatch forces if Libya’s rival government halts its offensive.

Turkey’s main opposition party, CHP, had vowed to vote against the motion arguing that the deployment would embroil Turkey in another conflict and make it a party to the further “shedding of Muslim blood.”

Before the vote, CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu called on the government to work for the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Libya.

Kurtulmus, the ruling party official, said the mandate does not exclude a peacekeeping force. He said, however, the government believes that U.N. peacekeeping missions were not successful in ending conflicts in the past.

Two other opposition parties voted against the motion.

“We cannot throw our soldiers in the line of fire of a civilian war that has nothing to do with our national security,” Aytun Ciray, a member of the opposition Good Party, said during the parliamentary debate.

However, Erdogan’s ruling party is in an alliance with a nationalist party, and the two held sufficient votes for the motion to pass.

Fighting around Tripoli escalated in recent weeks after Hifter declared a “final” and decisive battle for the capital. He has the backing of the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia, while the Tripoli-based government receives aid from Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

46238,9170b99336fb75b3684738ad66c9671b,"DHAKA, Jan 3, 2020 (BSS) – Prime Minister and Awami League (AL) President Sheikh Hasina today called upon her party leaders and activists to make the party well-organised to help the government work successfully.

“A government can work smoothly and successfully at the time when its party remains well-organised and it is regarded as the huge power for the government,” she said. The premier simultaneously asked the AL leaders and activists particularly the new central leadership elected after its 21st national council on December 21 last to work with sincerity for developing the party more well- organised accordingly.

She was speaking at the maiden joint meeting of the AL’s new central executive and advisory councils at the party’s central office at Bangabandhu Avenue here.

She said, “The power of a well-organised party is required mostly in making a country developed one. I personally realise it and for that reason, I always put emphasis on the party (organization).”

Members of the party’s central executive and advisory councils were present at the meeting presided over by AL President Sheikh Hasina.

The meeting was adjourned till 6pm tomorrow.

The premier dedicated the new central committee’s first meeting to her party’s former general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam as today is his first death anniversary. Syed Ashraful Islam died on January 3, 2019.

Noting that assassination of Bangabandhu along with other AL leaders aimed at keeping AL away from the state power, Sheikh Hasina said, “There was a target to destroy the Awami League in such a way that it never can assume power or take over the charge of running the state. But they (conspirators) didn’t succeed in doing so.”

The premier gave the credit to grassroots leaders for the survival of the party saying, “Grassroots leaders and activists of the Awami League always take the right decision and even they keep the party above all dedicating their lives.”

She continued: “Today, Awami League is a strong party. Awami League is the party which taught political lessons to others party and it has been doing it since its formation in 1949. We will have to keep up the tradition of the party in the days to come.”

The premier said those who assumed power through assassination of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975 never believed in the liberation of the country.

She went on saying, “They (Who don’t have belief in independence) always tried to make the country a failed state which was their main target.”

But, the Awami League’s target was to prove that the hard earned independence that was achieved through 24 years long struggle and the Liberation War with the supreme sacrifice of three millions people and at the cost of two lakh women’s chastity under the dynamic leadership of Bangabandhu must not go in vain, she said.

“I can say it without any hesitation that we have proved that,” the premier said, promising to work to keep it up.

Noting that the AL formed the government in 1996 after crossing many hurdles, Sheikh Hasina said, “The people of the country have seen the first ray of hope with Awami League assumed office and first realized that the government is public servant.”

She added: “We have completed 11 consecutive years (in power). —we have earned people’s confidence and trust that they believe that development only happens whenever the Awami League is in power.”

The premier said the example which her government set in terms of carrying out development of the country is now appreciated not only in Bangladesh but also in the globe.

The development of Bangladesh, she said is befitting reply to the people who used to say Bangladesh would be a bottomless basket after achieving independence, adding, “They now cannot say that as today’s Bangladesh is a role model for development (for the word).”

Sheikh Hasina coming down heavily on the BNP-Jamaat government for doing nothing for the country and its people rather indulged in money laundering and corruption to make their own fortune calling them smarter than the AL, saying, “The Awami League has proved that only this party can make development of the country.”

In this context, the premier said that she had heard lots negative remarks about the AL after returning home and taking charge of the party as president in 1981 that her party was not modern and smart and there was no educated people so it could not do this and that.

“The people who came to power claiming them smart only utilized the power to loot (government exchequer), resorted to money laundering and corruption. Their smartness was limited to make money for their own. But, the people of the country could not get anything from them.”

She continued the AL has proved that they can take the country forward towards development and prosperity and it is the AL which first used the modern technology.

The premier described the year 2020 as very important one for Bangladesh as the country is set to start the birth centenary celebration of the Father of Nation from January 10 next as Bangabandhu returned the country on that day in 1972.

The premier said the birth centenary celebration of Bangabandhu will be held round the year at home and abroad by the government, the party, the people from different strata of lives, various social and cultural organizations, missions abroad and many countries.

“With celebration of the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation, we will turn Bangladesh, which was given by Bangabandhu, into a more developed and prosperous one alongside making the independence more meaningful,” she said.

The premier said they have been working to increase the honour Bangladesh is now enjoying due to huge development works carried out by her government as the people of the country can roam around the world keeping their head high."," Threaten, not specified below",3

Mr Cummings posted an apparent job advert yesterday saying Number 10 wants to hire an ""unusual set of people with different skills and backgrounds"" to work as special advisers and potentially officials.

The blog post exceeding 2,900 words came amid reports that Boris Johnson is planning ""seismic changes"" to the civil service.

Mr Cummings, a former Vote Leave director, said he hopes to be made ""largely redundant"" within a year by the recruitment drive.

He called for officials including ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"", data scientists and policy experts to apply to a Gmail account if they think they fit the bill.

Mr Cummings warned that there is ""some profound problems at the core of how the British state makes decisions"" and that he currently makes decisions ""well outside"" his ""circle of competence"".

And he says the need for change comes with Brexit requiring large policy and decision-making structure changes and a Government with an 80-strong majority having ""little need to worry about short-term unpopularity"".

Under a subsection on hiring ""super-talented weirdos"", he writes that the Government needs ""some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole"".

Mr Cummings' post came after Rachel Wolf, who helped draw up the blueprint of Tory election pledges, said civil servants could be made to take regular exams to prove they are up to their Whitehall jobs.

Under ""seismic"" changes being planned by Number 10, she also said that civil servants are ""woefully unprepared"" for sweeping reforms that Mr Johnson is keen to push through.

“Iraqis — Iraqis — dancing in the street for freedom; thankful that General Soleimani is no more,” Pompeo wrote, alongside footage of scores of people running along a road and waving what appeared to be Iraqi flags and other banners.

President Donald Trump ordered the killing of the Iran Revolutionary Guards commander, who died Friday “in a decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad,” the Pentagon said.

“General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,” the Department of Defense said in a statement.

“General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.”

Pompeo did not provide a source for the video or offer any details about where the images were filmed.

The strike at Baghdad’s international airport also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

A pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy following deadly American air strikes on a hardline Hashed faction.

The US had called the strikes in response to a rocket attack days earlier that killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

The Pentagon said Soleimani had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the past months, including on December 27, the day the contractor was killed.

“General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the US Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week,” it said.

He spent all his life in struggling for God. Martyrdom was the reward for his tireless efforts over the years,” Khamenei said on Twitter.

Calling Soleimani’s loss “bitter”, Khamenei further said that their Jihad of Resistance will continue with more motivation. “The continuing fight & ultimate victory will be more bitter for the murderers & criminals,” he said on Twitter.

Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike at Baghdad International Airport on the orders of President Donald Trump, who appears to have acted with an eye on both an expected move in the US Senate to impeach him and his re-election bid later this year.

Reports emanating from Tehran indicate that the Iranian government’s top leadership is already considering ways to retaliate to the killing of Soleimani, a general considered very close to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Experts believe any retaliation could trigger a spiraling confrontation that could spread from Iraq and engulf the wider region.

The US Defence Department said it killed Soleimani because he “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region”. It also accused Soleimani of approving the attacks on the US Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.

46373,4ad0f850321d00fa204ee586971085bc,"New Delhi, Jan 3 (IANS): General Qasem Soleimani, the once reclusive head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) elite Quds Force who in the past directed inumerable covert operations abroad, has finally emerged in the global limelight following his death in a US airstrike ordered by American President Donald Trump.

Solemani was a major figure in the Iranian regime. From 1998, he led the Quds Force - an elite unit, which handles clandestine operations abroad.

His Quds Force directly report to Iran's Supreme Leader directly to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and he was hailed as a heroic national figure, according to a BBC report.

Iran has acknowledged the role of the Quds Force in the conflicts in Syria, where it has advised forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and armed thousands of Shia Muslim militiamen fighting alongside them, and in Iraq, where it has backed a Shia-dominated paramilitary force that helped tackle the Islamic State.

These conflicts turned the once-reclusive Soleimani into a something of celebrity in Iran.

Shortly, he became the subject of documentaries, news reports and even pop songs.

One music video widely shared in Iran was made by Shia militia fighters in Iraq.

It showed soldiers spray-painting the General's portrait on a wall and parading in front of it while stirring music plays in the background.

But the US has called the much decorated General and his Quds Force as terrorists and has also blamed them for the deaths of hundreds of American personnel.

The Trump administration has alleged that the Quds Force was ""Iran's primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting"" US-designated terrorist groups across the Middle East - including Lebanon's Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - by providing funding, training, weapons and equipment.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo designated the IRGC and its Quds Force as foreign terrorist organisations in April.

But his death has prompted Iranians to ""vow revenge"" on the US.

In a statement on Friday, Khamenei said the ""cruelest people on earth"" assassinated the ""honourable"" commander who ""courageously fought for year against the evils and bandits of the world"", the Tehran-based Press TV said in a report.

""His demise will not stop his mission, but the criminals who have the blood of General Soleimani and other martyrs of the Thursday night attack on their hands must await a vigorous revenge,"" the Supreme Leader added.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the attack an ""act of international terrorism"", tweeting that the US ""bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism"".

Mohsen Rezaei, the former commander of the IRGC, said Iran would take ""vigorous revenge on America"".

Jan. 3 (UPI) -- The Pentagon is sending up to 3,500 additional troops to the Middle East as tensions rise following the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in an airstrike, U.S. military officials said Friday.

CNN and NBC News, citing unnamed Defense Department sources, each reported thousands of new troops were heading to Iraq, Kuwait and other parts of the region, and will come from the Immediate Response Force of the 82nd Airborne Division.

U.S. officials told NBC, however, that the additional troops were not a direct response to Soleimani's death, which has triggered a furious reaction from Iran and its allies inside Iraq. Rather, they said, it's a continuation of an earlier announcement this week to send troops to the region.

President Donald Trump defended the airstrike Friday, saying Soleimani was planning ""imminent and sinister attacks.""

Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump said the United States does not seek regime change.

""We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war,"" he said.

Later Friday, at a Miami rally to launch an Evangelicals for Trump coalition, Trump said Soleimani's ""bloody rampage is now forever gone.""

""We do not seek war, we do not seek nation-building, we do not seek regime change,"" Trump told the crowd.

The Pentagon announced the death of Soleimani in a statement released late Thursday in Washington. The U.S. military accused him of developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in the Middle East and held him and the military force he oversaw responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.

They also accused Soleimani of approving the recent attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and orchestrating the Dec. 27 attack on a northern Iraqi military base in which a U.S. contractor was killed.

Those claims were reiterated in a news release posted Friday afternoon using quotes from an unnamed senior Defense Department official who, according to the Pentagon, spoke to reporters earlier Friday.

""We have been very clear with Iran and our Iraqi partners that these increasing attacks need to stop and that we would hold Iran directly responsible for any harm to U.S. personnel,"" the official said.

In a statement sent to UPI Friday, Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah said Katie Wheelbarger, acting assistant to the secretary of defense for international security affairs, along with senior representatives from the State Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, briefed members of the House Armed Service Committee and Senate Armed Service Committee Friday on 11 recent attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq since October and ""recent decisive defensive actions"" in response.

Those included the strikes against Iran-backed Kata'ib Hizballah as well as the elimination of Soleimani.

""These strikes offer the regime in Iran an opportunity to turn from its terrorist past and cease its unlawful, aggressive escalatory attacks,"" Farah said.

According to Farah, briefers stressed that they ""do not seek escalation with Iran"" and have taken appropriate measures to assure the safety of Americans and allies in the region.

Soleimani, along with Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the second-in-command of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Units, and several others were killed in the attack, Iranian state-run Press TV reported.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard said U.S. helicopters targeted vehicles near Baghdad International Airport, although subsequent reports have indicated a drone was used.

The strike prompted Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to vow his country would retaliate for the U.S. action.

""Harsh revenge awaits the criminals who have the blood of [Soleimani] and other martyrs of last night's incident on their hands,"" he said in a statement, the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency reported.

In a quickly escalating situation, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Friday urged all American citizens to ""depart Iraq immediately,"" saying they should leave by airline while possible, but failing that, to go to other countries via land.

""Due to Iranian-backed militia attacks at the U.S. Embassy compound, all public consular operations are suspended until further notice,"" it said.

Following news of Soleimani's death, Trump tweeted a picture of the American flag, while tens of thousands of people rallied on the streets of Iranian capital Tehran.

Later Friday, he posted another tweet saying the Iranian commander ""was plotting to kill many more"" Americans and he ""should have been taken out many years ago."" A third tweet stated, ""Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the airstrike Friday after returning early from a visit to Greece, saying, ""Just as Israel has the right of self-defense, the United States has exactly the same right. Qassem Soleimani is responsible for the death of American citizens and many other innocent people. He was planning more such attacks.""

The attack came hours after U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned Iran that continued attacks against U.S. forces would be met with a military response.

""To Iran and its proxy militias: We will not accept continued attacks against our personnel and forces in the region,"" Esper said in a statement. ""Attacks against us will be met with responses in the time, manner and place of our choosing. We urge the Iranian regime to end their malign activities.""

He later told reporters that the United States is prepared ""to exercise self-defense, and we are prepared to deter further bad behavior from these groups, all of which are sponsored and directed and resourced by Iran.""

For two days, rioters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, retreating after U.S. troops fired tear gas to disperse them. In response, the Pentagon has deployed about 750 additional troops to the Middle East.

Esper told reporters Thursday that U.S. facilities will be strengthened by troops to protect personnel.

""And, obviously, they have the capability to perform other missions, as well, as need be,"" he said.

The attack on the embassy was in response to the United States conducting airstrikes late December on locations that belong to the Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group Kata'ib Hezbollah, during which at least 25 people were killed and 51 injured.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Friday he was preparing a briefing for senators on the Iraq airstrike, urging them not to judge the events until then.

The president's move, he said, ""may prove controversial or divisive,"" but added, ""I anticipate and welcome a debate about America's interest in foreign policy in the Middle East.""

Candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination ripped Trump's decision to unleash the airstrike.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said that while ""no American will mourn"" Soleimani's death, Trump ""just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox"" that would prompt rather than deter future Iranian attacks on U.S. interests.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called the move ""reckless,"" predicting it would escalate the situation with Iran and increase ""the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., meanwhile, said a conflict in the Middle East ""could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars.""

The killing of Soleimani will ""negatively affect"" global security, Russia said, while Iraq's top lawmaker called the action a violation of his country's sovereignty.

A statement released by the Russian Defense Ministry called Soleimani, commander of Iran's elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Quds Force, one the strongest actors in the fight against jihadist terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida.

The Russian ministry said his death in an airstrike ordered by Trump was ill-advised.

""The short-sighted steps by the U.S., namely the killing of General Soleimani, will lead to a sharp escalation of military-political tensions in the Middle East region,"" the ministry said. ""It is fraught with serious negative consequences for the entire global security system.""

Condemnation also was swift among Iraqi lawmakers who said the airstrikes violated Iraq's sovereignty agreements with the United States.

Iraq Parliament Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi said the killings of Soleimani and al-Muhandis were ""a flagrant violation of sovereignty and a violation of international conventions.""

""Any security and military operation on Iraqi territory must have the approval of the government,"" he said in a statement. ""We also call on the government in this sensitive circumstance to take the necessary political, legal and security measures to stop such attacks."""," Threaten, not specified below",3

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed “severe revenge” against the United States after the killing in Iraq of Qassem Soleimani, a senior commander in the Revolutionary Guards.

A near legendary figure in Iran, Soleimani headed the elite Quds force and was widely credited with significant victories against Islamic State across the region. He was killed in a U.S. airstrike as his vehicle left Baghdad airport, and his death came as a highly unexpected escalation of tensions between Washington and Tehran.

“General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,” the Pentagon said in a statement that confirmed his death, blaming him for recent attacks on U.S. troops and the American embassy in Baghdad.

Khamenei called for three days of national mourning, and insisted that ""vengeance is in store for the criminals who stained their unclean hands with his blood and that of other martyrs in the incident last night.”

He later added, in English: ""His blood was shed by the most barbaric of men.""
